2022-10-09,Worrying words from Covid-19 inquiry chair,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"US public health officials are bracing for a possible Covid-19  surge in the coming weeks following indoor holiday gatherings among a populace that has largely abandoned preventive measures.
Concerns over this uptick come amid rising influenza and RSV  cases in America. This so-called “ tripledemic  ”, experts warn, could further strain the already overburdened US health system.
Evidence of an increase emerged in earnest after Thanksgiving, celebrated on 24 November this year. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's weekly new case data  reported on 30 November stood at 308,578, rising to 470,963 in the 7 December report. In the 14 December weekly report, that number dipped to 455,028 – but ballooned to 487, 367 in the 21 December analysis.
Hospitalization admissions are also on the rise. The seven-day average from 15 to 21 December was 5,376, compared to 5,052 the prior week. Data shows this increase has been in motion since late October, following several months of declines, according to the CDC. 
This increase is being felt in different ways across the US. In Florida, Covid hospitalizations across the state remain around three-month peaks, fueled by Omicron subvariants, the Palm Beach Post reported. 
Across Washington, DC's metropolitan area, cases have gone up since Thanksgiving, but they have not reached levels seen during the 2021 holiday season, when Omicron started to take hold across the US, according to the Washington Post.  Analysis of wastewater in Houston, Texas, suggests that there is a “mini-surge” that comes in conjunction with the growing prevalence of BQ.1 and BQ.1.1  omicron subvariants, the Houston Chronicle reported. 
While these numbers pale in comparison to the winter 2022 peak in the US – with more than 5.6m new cases reported the week of 19 January – officials are working to thwart this upward trend.
Joe Biden announced  on 15 December that his administration was re-starting a program that sends free Covid-19 tests to US households through the mail service. The White House said that officials were poised to support healthcare staffing needs across the US, and that medical supplies from the national strategic stockpile were ready to ship if necessary.
Although the US is staring down a possible seasonal increase, it appears that many are not all that worried. Just 14.6% of US residents aged five and up have received their updated booster dose, which is said to provide greater protection against Omicron variants, CDC data indicate. 
There have been nearly 1.1m Covid-19 deaths in the US. More than 100m cases have been reported, according to Johns Hopkins University data.","COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); HOLIDAYS & OBSERVANCES (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (91%); PUBLIC HEALTH (91%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (91%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INFLUENZA (90%); PUBLIC OFFICIALS (90%); DISEASE REPORTING (89%); COOKING & ENTERTAINING (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); THANKSGIVING (78%); TRENDS (78%); TRENDS & EVENTS (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (76%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (62%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (62%)

2022-12-26,US public health officials brace for possible Covid-19 surge after holidays,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"The number of active Covid cases has exploded across the country as Australia enters its fourth wave, prompting renewed warnings to protect vulnerable aged care residents.
Jurisdictions collectively recorded more than 58,000 new cases of Covid in the past week, with some states reporting a doubling in the number of people hospitalised with the virus.
New South Wales recorded 19,800 new cases in the past seven days, Victoria had 16,636 new cases, and Western Australia recorded more than 8,000. South Australia had 6,867 new cases in the past week, Queensland recorded 5,828, and the ACT and NT had 1,194 and 369 new cases respectively. Tasmania was yet to publish its weekly case numbers by 3.30pm on Friday.
NSW's chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, said it was clear the country was now in its fourth wave. Chant expected that the wave would probably peak before Christmas given its current trajectory.
“The wave is taking off with some trajectory, it will be quite a steep wave and hopefully the decline will be equally as steep,” she said on Friday.
“There is a sense that the wave may well peak before Christmas and we may be on the decline [by then].

“But the message is clear … this is an increased risk period for Covid, so please, now is the time to take those protective behaviours.”

In Queensland, where hospital bed occupancy had almost doubled, the chief health officer, Dr John Gerrard, said the state had moved to an “amber alert”  for the fourth wave.
“This was always expected and we continue to see waves of Covid-19 in the coming months and even longer,” he said.
“That is why we have devised the traffic light system so that Queenslanders can know when we are entering a wave and, equally important, when we are leaving a wave, so they might modify their behaviour appropriately.”
 From 3 November to 9 November, we recorded 5,828 new COVID-19 cases. Sadly, 15 deaths were reported during this time. Full details ?? https://t.co/KjEKBzWY9v pic.twitter.com/zNGyBp0644  — Queensland Health (@qldhealth) November 11, 2022
He said the average age of Covid cases had increased with each successive wave in Queensland this year. In the first wave, the average age was 33. The average so far in this wave has been 47, he said.
“We know that older people have been less likely to get Covid during the course of the year because they have been protecting themselves,” he said. “But with each wave, we are seeing more and more older Queenslanders acquire infection.”
Victoria said it had recorded an 18.1% increase in hospitalisations, and that the average daily number of new cases was 2,377 this week, up from 1,471 last week. The state's chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, said the increasing hospitalisations had been driven by the emerging Omicron subvariants including BQ.1 and XBB.
 This week we reported 16,636 new cases, averaging 274 daily hospitalisations and 11 daily ICU admissions. 41 deaths were reported in the past 7 days. Our thoughts are with those in hospital, and the families of people who have lost their lives. pic.twitter.com/EZlNU1TJPF  — VicGovDH (@VicGovDH) November 10, 2022
“There is currently no evidence to suggest these subvariants cause more severe disease,” he said. “However, hospitalisation rates are likely increasing due to waning immunity from past vaccination and the ability of these new subvariants to escape immunity from past infection.”
The aged care sector is also warning Australians to take extra precautions to protect vulnerable residents.
The Aged & Community Care Providers Association chief executive, Tom Symondson, urged anyone who was entering an aged care home to take a rapid test or wear a mask, and he urged staff who have tested positive to stay away from residents.

“Aged care providers are well equipped and prepared with supplies of PPE and their IPC protocols to manage Covid outbreaks, but we must continue to do everything we can to keep our residents and clients safe,” he said.
“We ask visitors to support staff in ensuring their loved ones are protected and remember to show your appreciation for their commitment in incredibly challenging circumstances.”

2022-11-11,Covid-19 case numbers exploding across Australia as fourth wave takes off,AUSTRALIA NEWS; Version:2,"Ministers will have a year to prepare before cross-examination at the UK's Covid-19 public inquiry , its chair, Heather Hallett, announced, as she opened what is likely be one of the broadest statutory investigations in the country's history.
The first cross-examinations of the government response to the pandemic, including decisions on lockdowns, maintaining public confidence and handling of scientific advice, will begin in summer 2023, three and a half years after the arrival of coronavirus, which has claimed more than 200,000 lives in the UK. 
Hearings on the UK's preparedness will start in late spring 2023, as Lady Hallett said she wanted to move as “speedily as possible so lessons are learned before another pandemic strikes”.
Boris Johnson had been repeatedly criticised by campaigners for the bereaved and Labour for delaying the launch of the inquiry. Hallett said it would scrutinise the “performance and effectiveness” of central government decision-making and its messaging – topics likely to expose current and former ministers.
The inquiry has powers to compel the production of evidence and appearances of witnesses.
Johnson's official spokesperson said the PM planned to cooperate with the inquiry. “It was the prime minister who established the inquiry and signed off on the terms of reference,” he said.
To make the “demanding” terms of reference more digestible, Hallett will break the inquiry into modules, with teams investigating and commissioning research on different issues. Hearings will run sequentially, suggesting proceedings could take a number of years.
At least eight other modules are likely to follow, but will not be announced until next year. These include: vaccines, therapeutics and anti-viral treatment; the care sector; government procurement and personal protective equipment; testing and tracing; government business and financial responses; health inequalities and the impact of Covid-19; education, children and young persons; and the impact of Covid-19 on public services and other sectors.
Hallett, a retired court of appeal judge and a crossbench peer, said people and organisations would have to apply to be core participants for each module.
Jo Goodman, co-founder of the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign, said: “Today was an emotional day for those of us who have lost loved ones and it meant a lot to hear Baroness Hallett recognise the 'devastating nature of bereavement' and the pain we have been through. Hopefully this will be reflected by not making bereaved families go through the stressful and draining process of applying to be core participants in every single module.”
Hallett also announced the public would be able to take part through a “listening exercise”, to begin later this year, which would gather the experiences of people most affected and “from those whose voices are not always heard”.
The responses will be analysed to highlight key themes, but individual accounts will not be investigated, to prevent an already sprawling inquiry from getting out of control.
Hallett said she would “need to be ruthless” and it would be impossible to call every witness, adding that the inquiry must focus on the key issues.
But she emphasised that inequalities would be “at the forefront” of the investigation.
“Those who have suffered the most want to know if anything could have been done to prevent or reduce their suffering, and that is why this inquiry has been established,” she said.
Hearings will take place in different parts of the UK, including in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and Hallett said her aim was to be “thorough and efficient, rigorous and fair”. When it came to gathering evidence she would speak out against “people or organisations who stand in the way”.
Lawyers have already asked the government for assurances it would not block the release of key information amid fears that doing so could expose it to claims for damages from families who lost loved ones.
Elkan Abrahamson, head of major inquests and inquiries at Broudie Jackson Canter, who represents bereaved families, said: “It is of fundamental importance that we have access to all relevant documents and that the government offers full disclosure to the inquiry. The bereaved would regard anything less than full disclosure as a coverup.”","INVESTIGATIONS (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); WITNESSES (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH (89%); FAMILY (85%); GOVERNMENT PROCUREMENT (78%); HEALTH EQUITY (78%); VACCINES (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (77%); PRIME MINISTERS (77%); APPEALS (76%); APPELLATE DECISIONS (76%); VIRUSES (76%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (73%); PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (73%); EMOTIONS (71%); JUDGES (70%); CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS & TEENS (67%); APPEALS COURTS (50%); PURCHASING & PROCUREMENT (50%)

2022-07-21,Public inquiry into UK Covid-19 response opens,WORLD NEWS; Version:3,"A new wave of Covid-19 infections is looming in New South Wales, the state's chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, will warn on Thursday, with transmission of the virus predicted to increase in coming weeks.
It follows Victoria's chief health officer, Prof Brett Sutton, making a similar announcement last week , with Omicron subvariants BQ.1 and XBB tipped to overtake BA.5 as the dominant variants throughout Australia.
Chant is expected on Thursday to  reiterate the importance of getting booster doses, and will again urge those most at risk of severe disease to plan ahead by talking to their doctor about the antivirals available to reduce the severity of infection.
She will also urge people to stay home if they have cold or flu-like symptoms  and ask those who must leave the house while unwell to wear a mask when indoors or on public transport. They should avoid large gatherings and high-risk settings, such as hospitals and aged or disability care facilities, for at least seven days.
Omicron subvariants BQ.1 and XBB are driving significant cases and hospitalisations overseas  due to their ability to escape immunity from past infection – and due to waning immunity from past vaccination. 
The World Health Organization does not consider the two subvariants as different enough from other circulating Omicron subvariants to warrant their classification as new variants of concern. But the two sublineages remain part of Omicron, which is a variant of concern.
The WHO has said there is no epidemiological data to suggest an increase in disease severity due to the variants.
“Cases of reinfection were primarily limited to those with initial infection in the pre-Omicron period,” a WHO statement published on 27 October said. “As of now, there are no data to support escape from recent immune responses induced by other Omicron lineages.”

The latest NSW respiratory diseases surveillance report , published later on Thursday morning, found data indicated the start of a new wave of Covid infections.
There were 9,707 people diagnosed with Covid in the week ending 29 October, an increase of 11.4% since the previous week, the report said. Emergency department presentations requiring admission increased to 118 from 96 in the previous week.
The federal health minister, Mark Butler, said on Thursday “there is evidence of a small increase at this stage in case numbers … coming off a very big decline that we've seen over the last couple of months”.
“We're monitoring that very, very closely,” he said.
“I just want to reiterate really, the advice of Kerry Chant this morning, the New South Wales Chief Health Officer: that this is a timely reminder to get your booster, to make sure that you are up to date with your vaccination.” There are 5m Australians over the age of 16, who are eligible for a third dose but have not yet had it, he said.
“For many of them, it will be more than 12 months since they had their second dose.”
On Saturday, the Victorian premier, Daniel Andrews, said fluctuations in case numbers would continue and “Covid will be with us in one form or another for quite a long time”.
“But we are treating it in a different way now because you've got to move beyond this,” he said.
“We're going to see Covid numbers go up and down. Whether it's a wave or whether it's a spike, I'll leave that for others to determine. This era of Covid exceptionalism has to end, and it has. National cabinet has made those decisions.”
Meanwhile, results from two complementary national serosurveys, one in children and adolescents and one in adults, were published on Thursday to provide a snapshot of the extent of infections across Australia to the end of August.
Serosurveys involve conducting tests on blood samples taken from thousands of Australians across various age groups, geographical locations and target populations. Researchers look for antibodies to the virus in the blood to determine the extent a population has been affected.
The children and adolescents survey found at least 64% of 0 to 19-year-olds in Australia had been infected with Covid-19.
Dr Archana Koirala, an infectious disease specialist at the National Centre for Immunisation Research and Surveillance and paediatric study lead, said: “Overall, this study tells us that at least two-thirds of children in Australia have had Covid-19.”
“This is more than double the number of cases reported based on nose and throat swab testing for the virus,” she said. “This is expected since many children have either mild or no symptoms and are therefore not tested for the virus.”
In children aged one to four years old, approximately eight out of 10 had evidence of past infection. This group was not eligible for vaccination at the time of the serosurveys; however,  high-risk, severely immunocompromised children aged six months to four years became eligible for vaccination from September.
The adult study found at least 65% of adults in Australia had been infected by the virus, similar to the proportion of children and adolescents.","COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); VACCINES (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (89%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (89%); COMMON COLD (78%); DISEASE REPORTING (78%); EMERGENCY ROOMS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEILLANCE (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); VIRUSES (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (73%); NEWS BRIEFS (73%); RESPIRATORY DISORDERS & INJURIES (73%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (71%); SURVEILLANCE (70%)

2022-11-02,"New Covid-19 wave to hit NSW within weeks, chief health officer says",AUSTRALIA NEWS; Version:4,"The French and British drugmakers Sanofi and GSK are ready to seek approval from regulators for their Covid-19 vaccine after reporting positive results from late-stage clinical trials.
The firms are hoping to catch up with rivals after falling far behind in the race to develop Covid-19 shots. Their product was delayed  by an early dosing error during trials, initially disappointing results in older people  and other issues. It will be available as a two-dose vaccine and as a booster.
The companies will now file for approval from regulators, including the US Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency, while a rolling review with the UK regulator, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, is already under way.
Sanofi developed the jab, while GSK, the world's biggest vaccine maker by sales, is supplying its adjuvant technology, to boost the body's immune response.
It relies on a conventional protein-based approach, compared with the newer mRNA technology used by Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna, which makes it easier to store and transport.
The companies said the phase 3 efficacy trials showed that two doses of the jab provided 100% efficacy against severe Covid-19 disease and hospitalisations; 75% efficacy against moderate or severe Covid-19 disease; and 57.9% efficacy against any symptomatic Covid-19 disease. They said the latter is in line with expected vaccine effectiveness given the emergence of several variants of concern, such as Omicron, and similar to other vaccines.
A separate trial showed that the jab boosted antibody levels against the virus 18- to 30 times across all age groups, when used in people who had been given two doses of other vaccines such as the Pfizer/BioNTech, Modern and Oxford/AstraZeneca shots.
Thomas Triomphe, the executive vice-president of Sanofi Vaccines, said: ""The Sanofi-GSK vaccine demonstrates a universal ability to boost all platforms and across all ages.
""We also observed robust efficacy of the vaccine as a primary series in today's challenging epidemiological environment. No other global phase 3 efficacy study has been undertaken during this period with so many variants of concern, including Omicron, and these efficacy data are similar to the recent clinical data from authorised vaccines.""
Roger Connor, the president of GSK's vaccines arm, said: ""We are confident that this vaccine can play an important role as we continue to address this pandemic and prepare for the post-pandemic period.""","VACCINES (97%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); CLINICAL TRIALS (91%); APPROVALS (90%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (90%); DRUG SAFETY REGULATION (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); BIOLOGICS MFG (78%); DRUG SAFETY (78%); IMMUNOLOGY (78%); HEALTH CARE LAW (73%); AMINO ACIDS, PEPTIDES & PROTEINS (72%); DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS (72%); EXECUTIVES (62%)

2022-02-23,Sanofi and GSK seek approval for Covid-19 vaccine,BUSINESS; Version:1,"Wimbledon's Covid-19 protocols are under review after Matteo Berrettini was forced to withdraw from the championships on the morning of his first-round match following a positive test for Covid-19.
The Italian was the second player in the men's draw to pull out in less than 24 hours after a positive test and the withdrawals prompted the women's French No 1, Alizé Cornet, to claim the virus was widespread in the locker room at Roland Garros, with players maintaining a code of silence.
Berrettini, the No 8 seed, was one of the biggest contenders for the title after reaching the final last year. After being out for nearly three months following surgery on his finger, the Italian returned at the beginning of the grass season and immediately won nine matches in a row, with titles in Stuttgart and Queen's Club. 
Wimbledon's review comes after the No 14 seed, Marin Cilic, another former finalist and a semi-finalist at the French Open this month, also withdrew on Monday having tested positive for Covid-19, stoking fears of an outbreak among the players. While Cilic trained with the men's defending champion, Novak Djokovic, in the days before the tournament, Berrettini trained with the No 2 seed, Rafael Nadal.
Wimbledon was conducted last year under significant Covid protocols, but this year the championships have returned to normal conditions. There are no preventative protocols for players, with the All England Club following UK government guidance.
After the recent outbreak the All England Club will review its current measureson Tuesday. “As a major event we have and continue to work in conjunction with the UK Public Health Security Agency and our local authority,” a spokesperson for the All England Club said on Tuesday. “We have maintained enhanced cleaning and hand sanitising operations, and offer full medical support for anyone feeling unwell. We are following UK guidance around assessment and isolation of any potential infectious disease. Our player medical team also continue to wear face masks for any consultation.”
After her straight-sets win against Yulia Putintseva on Tuesday, Cornet was asked about these recent developments and she said Covid was also present in the locker room at the French Open, referencing the withdrawal of Barbora Krejcikova after she tested positive. “At Roland Garros there was an epidemic of Covid-19 and nobody talked about it. In the locker room, everyone had it and we said nothing,” said Cornet.
Berrettini had been due to play Cristian Garín in the opening round and he was expected to make another deep run considering his form and his comfort on the surface.
In a statement on Instagram, Berrettini conveyed his disappointment. “I am heartbroken to announce that I need to withdraw from @wimbledon due to a positive Covid-19 test result.

2022-06-28,Wimbledon reviews Covid-19 protocols after Berrettini is forced out by virus,SPORT; Version:6,"North Korea  stands on the brink of a Covid-19 catastrophe unless swift action is taken to provide vaccines and drug treatments, experts have said, as the number of people reported to have fallen ill rose to almost 1.5 million.
The isolated country reported another big rise in new cases of what it continues to refer to as ""fever"" on Tuesday, days after it admitted it had identified Covid-19 infections  for the first time since the start of the global pandemic.
It recorded 269,510 additional cases and six more deaths, bringing the total number killed to 56 since late last month. About 1.48 million people have become ill with the virus since the first case was reported last Thursday and at least 663,910 people were in quarantine, according to official figures. The outbreak is almost certainly greater than the official tally, given a lack of tests and resources to monitor and treat the sick.
A significant Covid-19 outbreak could unleash a humanitarian crisis in North Korea, where the economy has been battered  by the pandemic-enforced closure of its border with China - its main trading partner - natural disasters, and years of international sanctions imposed in response to ballistic missile tests.
The regime is not thought to have vaccinated any of its population and does not have access to antiviral drugs that have been used to treat Covid-19  in other countries. Its hospitals have few intensive-care resources to treat severe cases, and widespread malnourishment has made the population of 26 million more susceptible to serious illness.
""It looks really bad,"" said Owen Miller, a lecturer in Korean studies at the School of Oriental and African Studies, London University. ""They are facing the rampant spread of Omicron without protection from vaccines, without much - if any - immunity in the population and without access to most of the drugs that have been used to treat Covid elsewhere.""
Offers of outside help have so far been met with silence. Instead, there is concern that the country's leader, Kim Jong-un , may be willing to accept a large but ""manageable"" number of cases and deaths to avoid opening his country up to international scrutiny.
Since it reported its first cases last week, North Korea's propaganda machine has portrayed the virus as an enemy that can be defeated through lockdowns, quarantine and greater vigilance. The state-run KCNA news agency has reported the delivery of unspecified drugs - ""the elixir of life"" - to pharmacies by army medical units, and public health campaigns calling for mask-wearing and social distancing.
But testing levels are far below what is needed to form an accurate picture of the outbreak and to quickly identify and isolate patients. Some observers speculated that authorities were deliberately underreporting cases to ease the pressure on Kim.
North Korea has carried out just 64,200 tests since the start of the pandemic, according to the World Health Organization, compared with 172 million in the neighbouring South.
""We were talking about a 0.1% fatality rate for Omicron in South Korea, but that's going to be significantly higher in North Korea, possibly even reaching 1%, although it's difficult to make accurate predictions at this point,"" said Jung Jae-hun, a professor of preventive medicine at Gachon University.
Kim, who says the outbreak is causing "" great turmoil  "", finds himself having to balance public health measures with efforts to revive the crumbling economy.
A ruling party member in North Hamgyong province said people were still going to work and markets remained open, reported the Japan-based Asia Press.  ""There are no bans on going outside. However, we've been ordered to double mask,"" the unidentified official told the website, which receives information from citizen journalists equipped with contraband Chinese mobile phones.
""People are going to factories and to their places of work as normal. The authorities don't want work to be disrupted. People get fever checks when they go to and from work."" The official said people were more concerned about being locked down and prevented from working than catching Covid-19. ""People are worried about how to survive.""
Some initially interpreted North Korea's admission that it was battling the virus - after two years of denying it had found a single case - as a plea for help. But it has already refused millions of vaccine doses  via the UN-backed Covax scheme, while South Korea says it has yet to receive a response to its offer this week of vaccines, drugs and medical staff.
""I'm sure the North Koreans will still be very wary of accepting major international aid and going back to the situation of the 1990s, when there were multiple different aid agencies operating in the country and this was felt by the leadership to be humiliating and potentially destabilising,"" Miller said, adding that the regime was more likely to turn to China for medical aid.
The Omicron variant has caused significantly fewer deaths and serious cases than previous strains in countries with high vaccination rates, proper medical services and previous exposure to Covid-19.
But that pattern is unlikely to be repeated in North Korea, said Kim Sin-gon, a professor at Korea University College of Medicine in Seoul. ""North Korea has many vulnerable people who don't have strong immune systems,"" he said. ""Its official inoculation rate is zero and it has no Covid-19 treatment pills.""
Without urgent international help, Kim added, ""North Korea may end up with the pandemic's worst death and infection rates in the world for its population size.""

2022-05-17,"North Korea on brink of Covid-19 catastrophe, say experts",WORLD NEWS; Version:2,"The Omicron variant has caused an avalanche of Covid-19 cases in Australia in the past months. While most people who catch the disease experience mild symptoms, many report feeling short of breath and sluggish for weeks afterward.
""It's normal to feel tired after a viral infection, and everyone's recovery is different,"" says Janet Bondarenko, a senior respiratory physiotherapist at Alfred hospital in Melbourne. ""But the severity of your Covid illness doesn't necessarily predict whether you will have those lingering symptoms.""
The coronavirus can damage various organs, causing ongoing fatigue, says Dr Robert Newton, professor of exercise medicine at Edith Cowan University. ""The cardiorespiratory system can't deliver oxygen to the working muscles efficiently. So what was a light to moderate intensity activity previously feels quite vigorous now.""
 Sleep and rest help your immune system to fight the disease but it is critical to start moving again to avoid further weakening of your body about seven days after the major symptoms have disappeared, Newton says.
Exercise increases capacity of muscles, heart and lungs, as well as the numbers of mitochondria - the energy factories within the muscle cells - which counteract the debilitating effects of the infection.
Here is a simple guide that can help you get moving again, but specialist advice from your GP or an exercise physiologist is recommended before you begin an exercise program.
                   The class: yoga                   
There is some evidence that the practice of yoga and meditation may help improve lung health , reduce viral susceptibility  and speed the recovery  from acute respiratory infections thanks to their relaxing effects.
""Controlling stress and anxiety is critical for recovery,"" says Newton. ""It's very important to look at strategies such as meditation, mindfulness and yoga to help the body to recover from the coronavirus infection.""
In a paper  published in the Journal of Alternative and Complementary Medicine, researchers stated that ""certain meditation, yoga asana (postures), and pranayama (breathing) practices may possibly be effective adjunctive means of [...] helping to reduce severity of Covid-19 disease, including its collateral effects and sequelae"".
                   The move: bodyweight exercise                   
Newton says incorporating resistance training is crucial to reactivate muscles. He says that bodyweight exercises, such as squats and push-ups on your knees, are a good starting point.
As you gradually regain your strength, you can begin to add light weights to your routine, using milk cartons or a weighted backpack.
Light resistance training triggers the production of hormones and cell-signalling molecules such as cytokines that work with the immune system to help the body repair.
                   The activity: walking                   
According to Bondarenko, the most accessible physical activity to do after a Covid-19 infection is walking. Especially if you can do it outdoors, Newton agrees.
Anyone can easily control the intensity of their walking, they say.
Beginning with easy, short strolls is ideal, says Bondarenko. Gradually, you can increase the length and the pace of your walks as long as that does not cause you extreme fatigue or leave you feeling breathless.
                   The hard pass: don't push yourself                   
Pushing through when you are still feeling sluggish after Covid-19 will not speed your recovery, says Bondarenko. ""It pushes you back a few steps rather than helping.""
She says it is essential to gradually allow yourself extra time to return to your pre-Covid shape. ""Everyone's recovery is different, but over time, everyone gets back to where they want to be.""
""Use your body as a barometer,"" says Newton. ""Test your perceived exertion to make sure you don't push the system into overtraining, because that will compromise your recovery.""","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); EXERCISE & FITNESS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); CORONAVIRUSES (89%); MEDITATION (89%); VIRUSES (89%); WEIGHTLIFTING (89%); YOGA (89%); SPORTS INSTRUCTION (86%); ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (78%); PHYSICAL THERAPY (78%); RESPIRATORY DISORDERS & INJURIES (78%); MINDFULNESS (77%); ANATOMY & PHYSIOLOGY (76%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (72%); BIOLOGY (71%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (70%); RESEARCH REPORTS (66%)

2022-02-16,How to move: exercising after having Covid-19,LIFE AND STYLE; Version:1,"Growing numbers of prominent members of Congress and senior staffers in Washington DC are contracting Covid-19, sparking concerns about the risk to Joe Biden as unmasked events increase at the White House.
Celebrations were being held on Friday at the White House for the Senate confirmation  of Ketanji Brown Jackson for the supreme court and the event was happening out of doors, said the press secretary, Jen Psaki, who missed  the US president's trip to Europe last month after testing positive for coronavirus.
The Georgia Democratic senator Raphael Warnock tested positive on Thursday shortly after voting in the Senate chamber to confirm Jackson.
Vice-President Kamala Harris, in her dual role as president of the Senate, officially announced the confirmation vote result for Jackson on Thursday afternoon, sitting mask-less on the dais, beaming as she marked the historic moment , and attended Jackson's celebration at the White House on Friday, although her communications director has been infected.
And the House of Representatives speaker, Nancy Pelosi, tested positive for Covid-19  on Thursday as well, after appearing unmasked at crowded indoor events with Biden on Tuesday and Wednesday.
Pelosi is the highest-ranking politician to contract Covid-19 since President Donald Trump was hospitalized with coronavirus in October 2020 .
While Biden tested negative after his interactions with Pelosi, the White House acknowledged that Biden could test positive in the coming days.
""It is possible he will test positive for Covid at some point,"" said the White House communications director, Kate Bedingfield, on CNN, noting that with antiviral treatments and vaccines ""people are out living their lives and certainly the president of the United States is doing that"".
The Republican senator Susan Collins of Maine tested positive for Covid-19 and at least eight House representatives have also tested positive for Covid-19, along with the commerce secretary, Gina Raimondo, who announced that she tested positive on Wednesday.
Capitol Hill's latest string of diagnoses came after several government officials attended a dinner held by Washington's Gridiron Club and Foundation, the journalistic organization, on Saturday, which many are calling a ""super-spreader"" event.
Though Pelosi did not attend Saturday's dinner, a growing number of officials who attended the gala have tested positive including the attorney general, Merrick Garland, who tested positive on Wednesday, Raimondo, Harris's communication director, Jamal Simmons, and other prominent figures.
Harris had been in close contact with Simmons, who tested positive on Wednesday after the Gridiron dinner, said Harris's press secretary, Kirsten Allen.
Simmons also attended events with Biden after Saturday's event, and was pictured at an event in the White House  East Room celebrating the Affordable Care Act, along with former president Barack Obama and Harris on Tuesday.
At least 37 positive Covid-19 cases have come out of Saturday's event , according to a letter sent by the Gridiron Club to its members.
In a statement made on Wednesday, the Gridiron Club president, Tom DeFrank, said ""there is no way of being certain about when they first contracted Covid.
""But they did interact with other guests during the night and we have to be realistic and expect some more cases,"" said DeFrank.  ""Except in cases of public officials who have on their own disclosed their status, we will protect the privacy of guests who test positive.""
While guests at Saturday's dinner were required to show proof of vaccination, a negative Covid test before the event was not mandated. 
Amid an uptick of Covid-19 cases in Washington DC and among several politicians, lawmakers excluded $15bn in pandemic aid  from a spending bill, cutting off access to vaccinations, Covid-19 tests and care for those without insurance.
Many cities, including Washington DC, have also dropped indoor mask mandates and vaccine requirements.
The US will also probably have a rise in cases in the next several weeks, said Dr Anthony Fauci, with a surge expected in the fall. 
The last time there was a supreme court confirmation celebration at the White House it was for now-associate justice Amy Coney Barrett and several Republicans contracted Covid.  The main event was held outside but there was a crowded reception indoors, shortly before the November 2020 presidential election - and before there was an approved vaccination for Covid.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (95%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); POLITICAL PARTIES (90%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (90%); VACCINES (90%); CORONAVIRUSES (89%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (89%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012 (89%); VIRUSES (89%); US CONGRESS (79%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (79%); PUBLIC OFFICIALS (78%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (78%); VACCINE CERTIFICATIONS & PASSPORTS (78%); ATTORNEYS GENERAL (77%); ELECTIONS & POLITICS (73%); RANKINGS (73%); COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS (71%); SUPREME COURTS (71%)

2022-04-08,"Psaki, Garland , Pelosi: Covid-19 spreads among leading Democrats and Biden officials",US NEWS; Version:1,"In an otherwise reflective essay by Prof Devi Sridhar ( Why can't some scientists just admit they were wrong about Covid?, 24 March  ), I was surprised to learn that I held views I do not hold. Early in 2020, I wrote a piece asking for more data, but this certainly did not ""mock"" those who were worried about Covid-19. I was worried myself.
I remain concerned about both Covid-19 and our frequently non-evidence-based responses to it. I have published dozens of peer-reviewed Covid-19-related papers (collected here  under ""Projects""). Like all science, I expect those papers must have many weaknesses. I always look for questioning scholars, like Prof Sridhar, to improve on them. However, I fear that isolating single sentences out of context, distorting the meaning of others and using misleading slogans (eg ""Covid-as-flu"") can't promote scientific precision or help society.
I celebrate the scientific progress made since 2020. I wasn't ""cynical"" about vaccines and treatments, but elated to see effective interventions developed faster than most scientists expected. We should promote their evidence-based use. However, my ignorance on many matters still remains large. Both before and during the pandemic, I have repeatedly discussed my own mistakes.

2022-05-14,New Zealand prime minister Jacinda Ardern tests positive for Covid-19,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"The global death toll from Covid-19 has passed 5 million, 19 months after the pandemic was first declared, according to figures released by Johns Hopkins University. Some experts, including those from the World Health Organization, believe the true toll may be two to three times higher than official figures suggest.
The number of deaths from Covid-19 far outstrip that of other viral epidemics in the 21st century and most from the 20th century, with the notable exception of the Spanish flu. The US, Brazil, India, Mexico and the UK together account for more than half of all deaths worldwide.
In the last 28 days, Johns Hopkins University has logged 197,116 deaths and 11.7 million new cases around the world.
After it was first recorded in China in late 2019, the coronavirus spread quickly to almost every corner of the world and the outbreak was declared a pandemic in March 2020.
In the last month, the US, UK, Russia, Turkey and Ukraine have recorded the most new cases, while 581m doses of vaccine have been administered worldwide. The US has the largest death toll, at 745,836, followed by India (458,437). Russia's official death toll stands at 235,318, although independent analysis of excess deaths in Russia by the Moscow Times suggests the true figure could be up to three times higher.
UK government figures show that in the last seven days there were 284,058 new cases, numbers last seen in the January and July peaks of the virus in the UK. In the last week 1,099 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total official death toll to 163,515. Nearly 80% of the population aged 12 and above in the UK have received two doses of a vaccine, and 86.9% have had at least one.
Ariel Karlinsky , a member of the World Health Organization's technical advisory group on Covid mortality , said the 5 million milestone was actually passed ""a long time ago"". He estimated the the true global death toll from the pandemic so far was ""at least 10 million people"".
""There are 5 million covid deaths just in India,"" he estimated in an interview with the Guardian.
Karlinsky said the most reliable indicator was excess death toll, which was typically 40% higher, according to data. But he said certain countries were statistical ""black holes"". These included India, Pakistan and many countries in Africa. Belarus and Nicaragua had dramatically undercounted Covid-related deaths, while in Egypt excess mortality was 13 times higher than official figures, he said.
There was a correlation between good governance and good data, he added. He said in Russia more than 872,000 people had died of Covid, according to his estimate on Monday , over three times the Kremlin's figure.
""Autocrats tend to manipulate data. In Moscow, it is much worse than reported. The numbers from Belarus are complete nonsense,"" Karlinsky said.
Dr Albert Ko, a specialist in infectious diseases at the Yale School of Public Health, said: ""This is a defining moment in our lifetime. What do we have to do to protect ourselves so we don't get to another 5 million?""
The death toll as tallied by Johns Hopkins rivals the number of people killed in battles among nations since 1950, according to estimates from the Peace Research Institute Oslo. Globally, Covid-19 is the third leading cause of death, after heart disease and stroke.
Hotspots for the virus have shifted over the course of the pandemic, with eastern European countries experiencing a surge amid low vaccination rates, while some places such as Thailand reopen to tourism. 
Dr Wafaa El-Sadr, the director of ICAP, a global health centre at Columbia University in the US, told the Associated Press: ""What's uniquely different about this pandemic is it hit hardest the high-resource countries. That's the irony of Covid-19.""
Wealthier nations with longer life expectancies have larger proportions of older people, cancer survivors and nursing home residents, all of whom are especially vulnerable to Covid-19, El-Sadr noted. Poorer countries tend to have larger shares of children, teens and young adults, who are less likely to fall seriously ill from Covid.
The Johns Hopkins University coronavirus tracking dashboard  has become regarded as one of the most reliable measures of the spread of the disease globally, as it is independent and run by a small team of disease modelling experts at the University in Baltimore. The dashboard project began in January 2020, initially with manual data entry, and it is now automated and scrapes Covid data from official government sources around the world, with a team of about a dozen people managing it.

2021-11-01,Global Covid-19 death toll passes 5m,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"The bereaved will be “at the heart” of the Covid-19 public inquiry, its chair, Lady Hallett, has pledged at the first public hearing in the investigation into the UK's handling of the pandemic, which the inquiry's counsel described as an “unprecedented and vastly difficult undertaking”.
Opening the first module to a sprawling inquiry expected to run for several years, Hallett addressed anger from some of the bereaved that their testimonies may not be heard as direct evidence , by saying: “We shall ensure that those most affected, particularly the bereaved, will be properly consulted.”
But she said if they were consulted on every stage of the inquiry it “would go on forever”. She insisted her priority was to reach conclusions “before another disaster strikes the four nations of the United Kingdom” and would not allow the inquiry to “drag on for decades”.
The Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group is upset Hallett is planning only a “listening exercise” to capture a cross-section of views among the hundreds of thousands of bereaved people in the UK. They want their evidence to be heard directly.
“There is a balance to be struck between making timely recommendations and the extent to which we explore every issue,” Hallett said.
Hugo Keith QC, counsel to the inquiry, also said it would need to be “ruthless” in its focus.
It is already set to consider  the performance of the public health system, care homes, lockdowns, schooling, children, minorities, mental health, the economy and border controls among other issues.
A communications company is being sought to handle the listening exercise, which some of the bereaved have described  as an attempt to “outsource the grief of bereaved families”.
In previous public inquiries, such as those into the Grenfell Tower fire and Manchester Arena bombing, family and friends provided “pen portraits” of victims at the start of the formal hearings. However, the UK pandemic toll of 204,776 people with Covid on their death certificate, is far higher.
“We feel very strongly that this inquiry should be focusing on the impact on the bereaved families and to do that our voices need to be heard inside the inquiry and taken as evidence,” said Fran Hall, who lost her husband, Steve Mead, 65, to Covid in October 2020.
Matt Fowler, a co-founder of the group, whose father, Ian, died in hospital in April 2020, said: “Anything less [than hearing the bereaved's stories directly] would be devastating for families like mine who have worked so tirelessly to get here and could cost lives in the future.”
Hallett used her opening remarks to argue the listening exercise would “ensure everyone across the UK who wishes to contribute to the inquiry can do so in a less formal setting … their contributions will inform the inquiry about the impact of the pandemic”. She denied anyone had been barred from giving evidence.
Keith said the listening exercise would take accounts from tens or hundreds of thousands of people, which would be “analysed and summarised before being provided to the inquiry teams and the core participants” as written evidence.
“This is scarcely marginalisation of those who have suffered,” he said. He added that individual evidence could still be taken on topics such as the function of the NHS 111 system, end of life care and mortuary arrangements if it related to systemic flaws.
Before starting proceedings with a minute's silence, Hallett said: “There is one word that sums up the pandemic for so many and that is the word loss … millions of people suffered loss, including the loss of friends and family members, the loss of good health both mental and physical, economic loss, the loss of educational opportunities and the loss of social interaction. Those who were bereaved lost the most.”
The inquiry is divided into numerous modules  to run in sequence. The first module, which opened on Tuesday, will examine the UK's resilience and preparedness for the coronavirus pandemic. Evidence hearings will not start until next year. The second will examine the core political and administrative decision-making, including the actions of the then prime minister, Boris Johnson, and his cabinet. It will look into the treatment of scientific advice, behavioural science and public messaging. Module three will examine how the health system coped.
It is a UK-wide inquiry but Scotland has set up its own inquiry into its government's handling of the pandemic.

2022-10-04,Covid-19 public inquiry opens amid anger from bereaved over testimony,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"The Covid-19 pandemic may have claimed 18.2 million lives around the world, more than three times the official death toll, a new study suggests.
The higher figure is a better estimate of the true global casualty figure to the end of 2021, according to an analysis by a consortium of health researchers published in the Lancet. 
They have based their calculation on the number of ""excess deaths"" which they believe were caused directly or indirectly by the pandemic. These are calculated by looking at the difference between the number of deaths recorded from all causes and the number of expected based on previous patterns.
""Our estimates of Covid-19 excess mortality suggest the mortality impact from the Covid-19 pandemic has been more devastating than the situation documented by official statistics,"" say the co-authors, who were led by Dr Haidong Wang, an associate professor of health metrics sciences at the University of Washington.
""Official statistics on reported Covid-19 deaths provide only a partial picture of the true burden of mortality. While the official Covid-19 death toll was 5.9 million between 1 January 2020 and 31 December 2021, the new study estimates that 18.2 million excess deaths occurred over the same period, suggesting the full impact may have been greater.""
The research is based on what Wang and his collaborators say are the first peer-reviewed estimates of excess deaths due to the pandemic in 191 countries and territories.
Previous research from Sweden and the Netherlands has found that Covid-19 directly caused most of the excess deaths found there.
If their estimate is correct, then ""the global all-age rate of excess mortality due to the Covid-19 pandemic was 120.2 deaths per 100,000 of the population and [the] excess mortality rate exceeded 300 deaths per 100,000 of the population in 21 countries"".
Globally, South Asia (5.3m), north Africa and the Middle East (1.7m) and eastern Europe (1.4m) had the largest number of excess deaths.
In terms of absolute numbers, India had more excess deaths due to Covid-19 than anywhere else - 4.07m - according to the findings. It was followed by the US (1.13m), Russia (1.07m), Mexico (798,000), Brazil (792,000), Indonesia (736,000) and Pakistan (664,000).
For the UK, the report's estimated excess Covid deaths (163,000 to 174,000) was close to the reported figure of 173,000.
The five highest estimated excess mortality rates per 100,000 people were seen in Bolivia (734.9), Bulgaria (647.3), Eswatini (634.9), North Macedonia (583.6) and Lesotho (562.9). 
Differences between official figures for Covid-related deaths and the researchers' estimates could be due to a lack of testing, challenges in reporting such deaths, or inability to access healthcare because the pandemic disrupted services, the authors say. That gap is largest in south Asia and sub-Saharan Africa.
They developed a statistical model to measure excess deaths in countries where all-cause mortality data were unavailable, which has enabled them to generate their figure of 18.2 million deaths. They also excluded weeks in which heatwaves occurred, so as not to skew the figures.
""A key finding from our study is that the totality of mortality impact from the pandemic is way beyond the reported Covid-19 death count,"" Wang said. ""Our analysis wouldn't have been possible without the promptly reported all-cause mortality data by week/month from so many countries. These data are critical in assessing disease burden and the state of population health in any country.""
Overcoming the ""political barriers to accurate [death] reporting"" is necessary in countries where they exist in order to track true death tolls from future pandemics, the Lancet paper argues.
""However, many countries still do not have a functioning vital [deaths] registration system. What happened during the pandemic demonstrated the need for both civil and vital registration systems and a disease surveillance system.""","COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); DEATH & DYING (92%); DEATH RATES (91%); RESEARCH REPORTS (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); STATISTICS (90%); POPULATION & DEMOGRAPHICS (89%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (78%); WRITERS (71%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (53%)

2022-03-10,Global Covid-19 death toll 'may be three times higher than official figures',WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"The Covid-19 public inquiry plans to scour some of Boris Johnson's WhatsApp messages as it seeks to identify any “plainly wrongful decision-making and significant errors of judgment” by central government in the early stage of the pandemic, the lead counsel to the inquiry has said.
Opening the second stage of the statutory inquiry, examining “how central government responded to the pandemic and made the key decisions that it did”, Hugo Keith KC said it would ask whether late lockdowns cost lives and whether rule-breaking undermined public confidence.
Speaking in a preliminary hearing before witnesses are cross-examined over eight weeks next summer, with the UK death toll from confirmed Covid exceeding 180,000, Keith said there would be “particular scrutiny” of decisions taken by the prime minister, the cabinet, senior political advisers and scientific and medical advisers from early January 2020 to the first national lockdown in late March.
WhatsApp messages between Johnson and Downing Street and other senior officials have been requested alongside cabinet minutes and notes of written and oral advice to ministers. Lawyers for disability campaign groups called for departments to admit to any deletion of documents and explain how they have preserved WhatsApp, Signal or Cabinet Office instant chat messages.
Dominic Cummings, Johnson's former chief adviser, has already published some messages from a Downing Street WhatsApp group used by him and Johnson. Ministers will be called to give evidence over eight weeks next summer.
Keith said the inquiry would also ask: “Was the declared policy of following the science a fair reflection of the actual decision-making?”
More than 200 scientists, including all those involved in the Sage group and others in the Independent Sage group, the latter of which was highly critical of the government's handling of the pandemic, have been asked to give evidence about the effectiveness of the response.
The inquiry will ask: “How effectively was Sage utilised by central government?” Keith said it would also ask if there was “an over-reliance on epidemiological modelling or mathematical modelling”. Imperial College London, which employs Prof Neil Ferguson, the epidemiologist whose predictions were prominent early in the pandemic, is among the core participants in this phase of the investigation.
Keith said the inquiry's job would be to ask whether anything could have been done to reduce loss and suffering caused by “death and illness on an unprecedented scale”. He described widespread “societal damage … with unmet health needs, damaged educational prospects [and] financial insecurity” and “immense” costs in human and financial terms.
Lawyers for groups representing disabled people, ethnic minority groups, woman, children and frontline workers urged the inquiry to investigate how far the government accounted for their needs. Liz Davies KC, representing organisations that help victims of domestic abuse, said the inquiry must investigate whether government decisions were backed by equalities impact assessments. Philip Dayle, representing the Federation of Ethnic Minority Healthcare Organisations, called for “institutional and structural racism” to be considered.
The inquiry is pressing ahead with a “listening exercise” to gather and summarise testimonies from people affected by the pandemic, despite opposition from bereaved groups who want their testimonies to be taken as evidence. The inquiry has issued a £970,000 contract to the polling firm Ipsos to carry out the exercise and a £800,000 contract to the communications company M&C Saatchi to inform the public how to take part. The inquiry chair, Lady Hallett, stressed that some personal testimonies would also be heard in evidence where they relate to “systemic failings”.
The inquiry is wrestling with how to prevent the sprawl of an already huge exercise that will take several years. The Cabinet Office has said it has so many potentially relevant documents that its material alone would take three years to review. 39 groups of core participants were represented at the preliminary module 2 hearing, including three long Covid support groups, disability rights groups, children's rights groups and bereaved families' groups representing the UK, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. 
The health system was represented by NHS England, the British Medical Association and social care operators.
Government bodies ranged from the Department of Health and Social Care to the office of England's chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, and the Scottish, Welsh and Northern Irish governments.","CABINET OFFICES (91%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); BRITISH PRIME MINISTERS (90%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (90%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); WITNESSES (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); ABUSE & NEGLECT (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); NEGATIVE NEWS (78%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (78%); NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWS (78%); RACE & ETHNICITY (78%); LAWYERS (76%); PRELIMINARY COURT PROCEEDINGS (75%); PRIME MINISTERS (73%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (73%); DEATH & DYING (70%); SCIENCE POLICY (68%); DISABLED PERSONS (67%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (60%); ETHNIC GROUPS (60%); MINORITY GROUPS (60%); DOMESTIC VIOLENCE (50%)

2022-10-31,Covid-19 inquiry to examine Boris Johnson WhatsApp messages,UK NEWS; Version:4,"The delayed public inquiry into the UK's handling of the Covid-19 pandemic has been launched after Boris Johnson accepted calls to widen the terms of reference to consider its unequal impact on minority-ethnic people, on children and on mental health.
The inquiry chair, Heather Hallett, and her team of 12 QCs have begun work under the terms of the Inquiries Act, which makes it an offence to destroy or tamper with evidence. She will be joined by two panellists to be appointed by Johnson, although she had argued for presiding alone.
The launch of what is expected to be one of the largest public inquiries conducted in the UK comes days after campaigners for the bereaved threatened legal action  against the government over the delay to the prime minister's commitment to set the inquiry up in spring 2022.
“Today is a special day for thousands of bereaved families from all corners of the country,” said Hannah Brady, a spokesperson for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign. “Finally we can begin the process of learning lessons from the awful suffering we've endured so that we can move forward with our lives and protect others in the future.”
The inquiry will “examine, consider and report on preparations and the response to the pandemic in England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland” and it begins as the number of UK fatalities with Covid on their death certificate approaches 200,000.
In an apparent warning  to people and organisations required to submit evidence and witnesses, which could include Johnson, cabinet ministers and senior civil servants, Lady Hallett said: “I shall not tolerate any attempt to mislead the inquiry, to undermine its integrity or its independence.”
The terms of reference  published by the Cabinet Office on Tuesday cover 37 topics divided into three areas: the public health response across the whole of the UK; the response of the health and care sector across the UK; and the economic response to the pandemic and its impact, including governmentinterventions.
The topics likely to prove most controversial include the use of lockdowns, which could examine the effect of rule breaking in Downing Street; the test-and-trace system; infection control in care homes, which the high court has already ruled was unlawful and “irrational”  ; the procurement and distribution of PPE; and the use of do-not-resuscitate notices.
In a letter to Hallett, Johnson described the terms of reference as “undoubtedly … broad and challenging”.
The inquiry will travel around the UK to take evidence, and Hallett said it would listen to people who had suffered during the pandemic and felt they had been ignored. It would produce a series of interim reports “to reduce or prevent the suffering and hardship in any future pandemic”, she said.
Evidence hearings are expected to begin in 2023 and Hallett has asked for patience as she and team try to meet what she described as an ambitious timetable.
Downing Street agreed the inquiry should examine disparities evident in the impact of the pandemic on different categories of people, including those relating to legal “protected characteristics” under equality laws which means the impact of poverty as well as race, religion and gender could be examined.
It will not consider individual cases of harm or death in detail, but instead will launch a “listening project” to gather accounts from those who were bereaved to “inform its understanding” of the pandemic's impact, the response and the lessons to be learned.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); INVESTIGATIONS (91%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (90%); FAMILY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); LAW & LEGAL SYSTEM (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); CABINET OFFICES (89%); EPIDEMICS (89%); LITIGATION (89%); SUITS & CLAIMS (89%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS & TEENS (77%); WITNESSES (76%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (73%); CIVIL SERVICES (73%); DEATH & DYING (73%); APPOINTMENTS (71%); SENIOR HOUSING (68%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (67%)

2022-06-28,Delayed public inquiry into UK's Covid-19 response opens,WORLD NEWS; Version:2,"Joe Biden has selected a new White House Covid-19 response coordinator to help lead the US's fight against the virus, the US president announced on Thursday.
Dr Ashish Jha has been named as the new response coordinator. Jha, who is the dean of Brown University's School of Public Health, is a well-known public health expert.
In 2014, Jha co-chaired an international investigative commission that looked into the failures of the global response to the Ebola outbreak.
""Jha is one of the leading public health experts in America, and a well-known figure to many Americans from his wise and calming presence,"" Biden said in a written statement.
""As we enter a new moment in the pandemic - executing on my national Covid-19 preparedness plan and managing the ongoing risks from Covid - Dr Jha is the perfect person for the job,"" he added.
Jha will be replacing Jeff Zients, the current White House Covid-19 response coordinator.
Biden praised Zients, calling him ""a man of service and an expert manager"".
When Biden first appointed Zients 14 months ago, less than 1% of Americans were fully vaccinated, fewer than half of schools across the country were open and the US lacked any at-home Covid tests.
Today, nearly 80% of adults are fully vaccinated, over 100 million are boosted, nearly every school is open and hundreds of millions of at-home tests are distributed every month, the president said.
""The progress that [Zients] and his team have made is stunning and, even more important, consequential. Lives have been saved.
""I will miss his counsel and I'm grateful for his service,"" Biden added.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (95%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); APPOINTMENTS (91%); PUBLIC HEALTH (91%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (90%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); DISASTER PLANNING (78%); EBOLA VIRUS DISEASE (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); VACCINES (78%); TROPICAL DISEASES (73%); UNIVERSITY ADMINISTRATION (73%); HOME HEALTH TESTING (65%)

2022-03-17,Biden names Ashish Jha as new White House Covid-19 response coordinator,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"For almost two years, our lives have been dramatically impacted by the Covid-19 pandemic, with millions of us changing the way we live, work and interact with each other on a daily basis. But now, as the last remaining Covid-19 restrictions have been lifted in England and Northern Ireland  - with Scotland scheduled to follow - self-isolation for those with the virus is no longer a legal requirement. So, as we move towards the next stage of the pandemic, it's still crucial to remain vigilant, taking care to protect our health and others.
                     Behaviours that build protection  Despite the rules changing, vaccines and boosters remain our best defence against Covid-19, significantly reducing the risk of serious illness from the virus. Research shows that unvaccinated people are more likely to be hospitalised  with the virus than those who have had both doses of the vaccine and a booster. Being vaccinated also means there's a much smaller chance of developing long Covid, too.
It's still important to take up vaccinations and boosters if they are overdue - and to encourage loved ones to do the same, says GP Dr Thuva Amuthan. ""Over the last few years, we have learned so much about coronavirus and have become very well informed of infection control precautions. It's crucial we continue to follow these,"" he adds.
""Boosters allow our bodies to prepare a more robust and protective immune response, even against some variants, meaning your immune system is likely to be much better prepared,"" he says. ""Vaccinations have been very effective at reducing Covid-related hospitalisations and deaths. Studies have actually shown the risk of developing long Covid was reduced by approximately 50% in those who were double vaccinated.""
Another GP, Dr Amina Ahmed, adds that it is important to remember that viruses can mutate and evolve. ""These are called 'strains' and sometimes boosters will include small changes to teach the body to manage these strains,"" she says. ""The aim of Covid-19 vaccines is to minimise the growth of the virus when your body comes into contact with it, which prevents the spread of Covid because the body kills it. As the body can kill the virus more swiftly, the virus does not get the chance to do as much damage or cause long-term symptoms.""
                     Behaviours when ill  Even with all restrictions ending, it doesn't mean the virus has disappeared - and the reality is, many of us are still likely to become infected over the coming months. So it's important we continue to recognise symptoms and adapt our behaviours where possible, even when it's not a legal requirement.
Symptoms of the virus can vary from person to person, but the main symptoms  should still be easily recognisable, says Ahmed. ""The main symptoms of Covid are a new and continuous cough - so coughing a lot for more than an hour, or three or more coughing episodes in 24 hours; a high temperature - feeling hot to the touch on your back or chest; and changes to your taste and sense of smell.""
For anyone experiencing symptoms, make sure to minimise your contact with others - even though it is no longer a legal requirement.
""This is because you may have the infection and these measures will prevent the infection spreading to others,"" says Ahmed. ""You should take these measures even if you are fully vaccinated because you are giving your body time to kill the virus and will not be spreading it while your body upscales its infection-fighting systems. If your test is positive, then follow government guidance, but take measures to prevent the spread, too.""
Amuthan adds: ""Just as you would if you had a cold or a stomach bug, it is vital we continue to practise stringent hygiene measures to avoid the spread of coronavirus.
""Rest will not only help your body recover but also avoid spreading it to others. Make sure you are drinking plenty of water and eating well, too.""
                     Always-on behaviours  A major stumbling block around slowing the spread of Covid-19 has always been people who have the virus but show no symptoms at all, spreading the virus unintentionally. Without realising you have Covid-19, it's very easy to infect others, which is why it's so important to practise simple, helpful behaviours that stop the virus hanging around.
The first is face coverings or masks, which are especially useful in enclosed public spaces. Wearing a face covering over your nose and mouth in an enclosed space helps stop the spread of the virus, since anyone with Covid-19 releases contagious droplets when they exhale, which spread quickly.
""Wearing masks helps because if you have the infection, the mask keeps the droplets from spreading,"" says Ahmed. ""If you don't have the infection, the mask will prevent you from inhaling airborne infected droplets, too.""
Ventilation is incredibly important as well, since when indoors, coronavirus particles hang around in the air like smoke. Letting fresh air in when meeting indoors could be the difference between spreading the virus or not, since fresh air disperses Covid-19 particles.
If an area is enclosed, all the individuals in that small space are likely to come into contact with contagious droplets, whether they are in the air or on surfaces,"" says Ahmed. ""Instead, we should meet in open spaces, or ensure indoor spaces are well-ventilated, so that infected droplets are dispersed widely and quickly, reducing the risk that we come into contact with them.""
Even small actions such as opening windows for 10 minutes every hour when visitors are over, or letting fresh air into rooms before and after visits, helps dilute any virus particles. Likewise, leaving extractor fans running in bathrooms and kitchens can help spread fresh air around the home. The same advice applies to car-sharing, and in the workplace.
Meeting outside where possible is not only helpful for our mental wellbeing but will also reduce the spread of coronavirus,"" says Amuthan. ""If you have coronavirus, it's really important you follow these behaviours to reduce the spread as much as possible. Until enough of the world is vaccinated for us to develop herd immunity, we need to continue these practices to avoid further variant pandemics.""
Regular handwashing is another habit well worth continuing, says Ahmed. ""It is important to wash hands to prevent the spread if you are infected, but also to prevent the virus entering your body,"" she says. ""Washing your hands regularly will ensure infected droplets are washed off before they reach your mouth and nose. This is also why we advise people not to touch their face when their hands aren't clean.""
If you're worried that some of your good habits are starting to slip, Ahmed suggests a creative approach to envision how the virus spreads: ""Try imagining infected droplets as honey that sticks to whatever it touches,"" she says. ""An infected person will have honey on their hands and leave it in areas they touch, such as door handles, switches and so forth. Instead, prevent spreading it by washing your hands regularly. The idea for those not infected is to avoid getting that honey on their hands from these surfaces. And if you do, wash it off before honey ends up on your face.""

2022-03-04,Living with Covid-19: how to stay safe as the rules change,ALL TOGETHER; Version:1,"A snow leopard at a zoo in Bloomington, Illinois, has died after contracting Covid-19.
Miller Park Zoo  announced the death of Rilu, 11, which the zoo previously said ""began coughing and had a raspy respiration beginning on 20 November"", in an Instagram post  on Thursday.
Noting the animal's spectacular tail, which was almost as long as its body, the zoo said Rilu produced seven offspring which are now part of its Species Survival Plan.
""Rilu's personality and beauty will be missed by guests and staff but he will not be forgotten,"" said superintendent Jay Tetzloff, adding that masks are required in all indoor spaces at the Bloomington zoo.
According  to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), most animal Covid infections come from contact with humans ""including owners, caretakers or others in close contact"".
Among animals vulnerable to Covid, the CDC lists companion animals including cats, dogs and ferrets; several types of big cats; otters; non-human primates; binturong; coati-mundi; fishing cats; hyenas; mink; and wild white-tailed deer.
The photographer Joel Sartore , whose image of Rilu accompanied the announcement of the animal's death, paid tribute in his own post. 
""Snow leopards are proving extremely susceptible to the disease and it's often fatal,"" Sartore said. ""If you haven't received a vaccination and booster yet, please do so. It's more than just human lives that are at stake. Thank you.""
In December, three snow leopards  at the Lincoln Children's Zoo  in Nebraska died of complications from Covid-19. Two Sumatran tigers recovered.
In July, zoos in Oakland and Denver announced they would start vaccinating tigers, bears and other mammals with a two-dose vaccine first administered in March to gorillas in San Diego. 
Zoetis, a New Jersey animal health company, has said it has donated more than 11,000 vaccine doses to almost 70 zoos and wildlife sanctuaries, as part of an effort authorised by the US Department of Agriculture.
In December, two hippos at a zoo in Antwerp, Belgium, tested positive for Covid-19. Imani, 14, and Hermien , 41, showed no symptoms ""other than runny noses"", the zoo said.

2022-01-08,Snow leopard at Illinois zoo dies after contracting Covid-19,US NEWS; Version:1,"It is well known that influenza is seasonal, peaking in the winter in temperate regions and during the wet season in tropical locations. So does Covid-19 follow a similar seasonal pattern?
To answer this question scientists compared coronavirus rates between March 2020 and March 2021 from five countries - Canada, Germany, India, Ethiopia and Chile - with daily mean temperature, humidity, ultraviolet radiation and air-drying capacity (a measure of how quickly droplets evaporate). 
In countries with temperate climates they found Covid-19 peaked during the winter months, when temperature and humidity were low. Meanwhile, in countries with tropical climates the cases peaked during the summer monsoons, when humidity was high.
The results, published in the journal GeoHealth , reveal that there were two variables - ultraviolet levels and air-drying capacity - that consistently correlated with Covid-19 levels in all countries. Bright sunshine and fast evaporation were associated with falling rates of coronavirus, while cloudy skies and slow evaporation appear to aid the spread of the virus. 
Anticipating the seasonality of Covid-19 will be important in combating its spread, ensuring booster vaccines are given before the peak season takes-off, for example. But seasonality is only one factor, we shouldn't drop our guard just because it is sunny and dry.","VIRUSES (96%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); CORONAVIRUSES (93%); INFLUENZA (92%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); VACCINES (78%); CLIMATOLOGY (77%); WEATHER (76%); RESEARCH REPORTS (72%); MONSOONS (71%)

2021-08-24,Does Covid-19 follow a similar seasonal pattern to flu?,NEWS; Version:1,"Brooklyn Nets stars Kyrie Irving and Kevin Durant have entered into the league's Covid-19 health and safety protocols, multiple media outlets reported on Saturday.
Seven-time All-Star Irving has not suited up for the team yet this season because he refuses to take the Covid-19 vaccine, which is required to enter the Nets' Barclays Center.
On Friday, the team said it would welcome back Irving for games  and practices in which he is eligible after having initially determined that he wouldn't play with them at all until he could play in both home and road games.
Members of New York's pro and college teams must be vaccinated against the coronavirus to be able to play in public arenas. Irving refused to get vaccinated and hasn't practiced with the Nets since October.
Durant has been putting together an MVP-caliber season, averaging 29.7 points per game and shooting 52.3% from the field for the Eastern Conference-leading Nets.
Durant scored 34 points and grabbed 11 rebounds in Thursday's 114-105 win over the Philadelphia 76ers in a game for which the team was without seven players due to the health and safety protocols.
The NBA, NFL and NHL have all seen games postponed due to the recent Covid-19 outbreak.
The NBA rolled out tighter Covid-19 protocols amid a sudden wave of Covid-19 cases and, according to a memo seen by Reuters on Friday, will increase testing from 26 December to 8 January and return to mask usage in many situations until agreed otherwise by the league and union representing its players.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); BASKETBALL (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); SAFETY REGULATION & POLICY (90%); VACCINES (90%); FACE MASK MANDATES (89%); SAFETY (89%); ATHLETES (79%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY SPORTS (79%); SPORTS & RECREATION (79%); SPORTS AWARDS (79%); ANTI-VACCINE MOVEMENT (78%); MANDATORY COVID VACCINATIONS (78%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (77%); CORONAVIRUSES (73%); VIRUSES (71%)

AstraZeneca and Johnson & Johnson have pledged to provide their doses on a not-for-profit basis  until the pandemic ends. 
                   Pfizer/BioNTech                   
Sales worth $11.3bn (£8bn) were made by Pfizer  in the first half of this year from the Covid-19 jab that it developed with Germany's BioNTech. In July it lifted its 2021 sales forecast to $33.5bn.
BioNTech expects to make revenues of nearly 16bn (£13.5bn)  from the vaccine this year, as its first-half net profit jumped to almost 4bn from 142m a year earlier.
The two firms have agreed to supply up to 1.8bn doses  to the EU from December up to 2023, on top of 600m doses previously ordered this year. The US government has ordered 700m up to April next year for Americans, as well as 500m for donations to the poorest nations. 
Pfizer and BioNTech are aiming to produce 3bn jabs this year and 4bn next year. They are now charging the EU 19.50 per jab, up from 15.50 in the first procurement deal, the Financial Times reported. The UK is also reportedly  paying more than previously, about £22 a shot for 35m doses for next year's autumn booster campaign. 
Pfizer's chief executive, Albert Bourla, recently explained the tiered pricing. ""This means wealthier nations would pay about the cost of a takeaway meal for each dose ... middle-income countries would pay roughly half that price ... and to low-income countries we were offering them doses at cost.""
                   Moderna                   
This company generated nearly $6bn of sales from its Covid-19 vaccine in the first half of the year, achieving a $4bn net profit - the first half-year profit since the firm was founded in Massachusetts in 2010.
Moderna has signed $20bn worth of vaccine contracts this year, including that for 17m doses to the UK, 460m to the EU and 500m to the US. It expects to produce up to 1bn jabs this year, followed by 2bn-3bn in 2022.
It has charged the US government (which helped fund the development of the vaccine) up to $16.50 a dose, and has sold it for $22 to $37 outside the US. Last week the company also said that sales under the Covax vaccine initiative  to low-income countries were ""considerably lower than the price to the US government"". The firm has reportedly  lifted the price it charges the EU to $25.50 a dose from about $19 in its first deal.
                   AstraZeneca                   
Revenue of $1.2bn  was achieved by AstraZeneca from the vaccine it developed with the University of Oxford in the first half of the year. So far it has shipped 1bn doses globally and is aiming to produce a total of 2bn-3bn jabs this year. The UK government is in negotiations with AstraZeneca to order a new version of its vaccine adapted to tackle variants of the coronavirus. Results from clinical trials are expected later this year.
The AstraZeneca jab is the cheapest of the main Covid-19 vaccines, priced at just $2.15 a dose in the company's contract with the EU , rising to just over $5 a shot elsewhere.
However, the EU has not ordered any more doses after the vaccine was linked with rare blood clots. AstraZeneca's chief executive, Pascal Soriot, said last month that ""at some point in the future"" the company would raise its prices, adding: ""We cannot be a non-profit forever, but we will never intend to make large profits.""
                   Novavax                   
Denmark has ordered 280,000 doses of Novavax's Covid-19 vaccine for $5.8m - roughly $20.90 per dose - as part of an EU deal with the US company. The European Commission said last week it would buy up to 200m doses of the vaccine, which is yet to be approved by the EU's drugs regulator.","VACCINES (95%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PRICE CHANGES (90%); PRICE INCREASES (90%); COMPANY EARNINGS (89%); COMPANY PROFITS (89%); EUROPEAN UNION (89%); PRICES (89%); CLINICAL TRIALS (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); VIRUSES (78%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (76%); BUSINESS FORECASTS (74%); SALES PROJECTIONS (74%); PRICE MANAGEMENT (73%); PRODUCT PRICING (73%); PURCHASING & PROCUREMENT (73%); EXECUTIVES (50%)

2021-08-11,"Covid-19 vaccines: the contracts, prices and profits",WORLD NEWS; Version:4,"A cohort of scientists from across the world believe that there is a growing body of evidence that Covid-19 can cause diabetes in some patients.
 Prof Francesco Rubino, from King's College London, is leading the call for a full investigation into a possible link between the two diseases. Having seen a rise in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in people who have caught coronavirus, some doctors are even considering the possibility that the virus ? by disrupting sugar metabolism ? could be inducing an entirely new form of diabetes.
Rubino first realised the possibility of a link during a tea party with colleagues over Zoom where anecdotal cases were being exchanged.
Rubino and others set up a registry to start pooling and analysing these reports. The principal investigators of the registry  which has received reports from more than 350 individual clinicians who suspect they have encountered one or more cases of Covid-induced diabetes - have said the numbers were hard to ignore.
""Over the last few months, we've seen more cases of patients that had either developed diabetes during the Covid-19 experience, or shortly after that. We are now starting to think the link is probably true - there is an ability of the virus to cause a malfunctioning of sugar metabolism,"" said Rubino.
If there was a biological link, it would be difficult to prove without a substantial database, he noted. ""We said it's worth embarking on an investigation because this - especially given the size of the pandemic - could be a significant problem.""
Patients with pre-existing diabetes have a higher risk of serious complications with Covid-19 and are on the UK priority list to receive the vaccine.  Links between other viruses and diabetes, and the way the Sars-CoV-2 virus that causes Covid-19 penetrates multiple organs has triggered concern.
""In my own mind, there's no doubt. Covid-19 is certainly a cause of new diabetes,"" said Paul Zimmet, professor of diabetes at Australia's Monash University. ""But we don't yet fully understand - firstly, the magnitude and, secondly, which of the things that we've hypothesised are the major factors.""
Scientists have hypothesised that since Sars-CoV-2 interacts with a receptor called ACE-2 to infiltrate cells in a range of organs, including the pancreas, it could be disrupting the sugar metabolism. Another potential explanation is the body's exuberant antibody response, which is meant to fight the virus, overreacts and attacks the organs key to maintaining normal glucose levels.
""Now, these are all theories ... theories that are not philosophical but grounded in biology and experience with other viruses,"" said Rubino, who is chair of metabolic and bariatric surgery.
Other viruses - particularly enterovirus infections  - have been associated with causing type 1 diabetes, in which the body attacks the cells in the pancreas thwarting the production of insulin. Enterovirus antibodies have been recorded at higher levels in pregnant mothers of children that have gone on to develop type 1 diabetes, and more enterovirus infections tend to be detected in children who develop the condition, compared with siblings that don't.
Dr Sathish Thirunavukkarasu, an investigator at Canada's McMaster University, has conducted a review  encompassing eight studies from different countries from the first five months of the pandemic. Thirunavukkarasu and colleagues found a combined 492 cases of newly diagnosed diabetes among 3,711 hospitalised Covid-19 patients, or a pooled proportion of 14.4%.
These figures include both Covid-19 patients who were diagnosed with diabetes for the first time, as well as people who previously had diabetes - but didn't know they had the disease, he explained.
It's hard to ignore the dramatic symptoms of type 1 diabetes, where the body does not make any insulin. But in the case of type 2 diabetes - in which the body is unable to make enough insulin or the insulin doesn't work properly - symptoms are easy to miss because they appear gradually.
About 3.9 million people in the UK  have been diagnosed with diabetes as of 2019, but doctors believe there are thousands who remain undiagnosed, a statistic that has probably worsened  because of the pandemic.
Ian Braithwaite, an NHS doctor and co-founder of Habitual, a diabetes prevention and reversal company, pointed out that the analysis by Thirunavukkarasu and colleagues was also limited to patients in hospital, so it wasn't clear if the cases of diabetes persisted as they recovered, or whether the rise in sugar levels puts patients at risk for diabetes.
A rise in sugar levels could have nothing to do with diabetes and everything to do with the body's response to infection. In addition, steroids that are used to treat certain patients with Covid-19 are also known to raise blood sugar levels, doctors have highlighted.
Other recent studies have linked Covid-19 with new-onset diabetes to varying degrees. Researchers in China who tracked 2,469 Covid-19 patients after they were discharged from hospital for six months recorded 58 (roughly 2.35%) cases of new-onset diabetes.  A separate still to be peer-reviewed study that looked at the outcomes of 47,780 Covid-19 patients within five months of hospital discharge in England  found that 4.9% of patients were diagnosed with diabetes post-discharge.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (95%); DIABETES (95%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); BIOCHEMISTRY (89%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (89%); CORONAVIRUSES (89%); SARS (89%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (89%); VIRUSES (89%); AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS (78%); BIOLOGY (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); TYPE 2 DIABETES (78%); VACCINES (78%); SURGERY & TRANSPLANTATION (73%); VIRTUAL EVENTS (73%); BARIATRICS (50%)

2021-03-19,Doctors suggest link between Covid-19 and diabetes,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"Aaron Rodgers has tested positive for Covid-19 and will miss the Green Bay Packers' game with the Kansas City Chiefs on Sunday, according to multiple reports. His exact vaccination status remains unclear.
The meeting with the Chiefs would have seen arguably the two most talented quarterbacks in the NFL, Rodgers and Patrick Mahomes, face each other. Instead, the Packers will be led by Jordan Love, the man Green Bay controversially drafted in 2020 as the 37-year-old Rodgers' long-term successor. 
Rodgers' exact vaccination status is unknown but in August he told reporters he was ""immunized"". However, NFL Network's Ian Rapoport reported  that does not necessarily mean Rodgers is vaccinated against Covid-19. Rapoport added  that Rodgers has been following protocols for unvaccinated players around the Packers facility. 
#Packers  QB Aaron Rodgers was quoted as saying he's been ""immunized."" By the letter of the law in the NFL, that does not equal vaccinated. https://t.co/g5xyjDZ6uL  - Ian Rapoport (@RapSheet) November 3, 2021
""You know, there's a lot of conversation around it, around the league, and a lot of guys who have made statements and not made statements, owners who have made statements,"" Rodgers said when asked about his vaccination status in August. ""There's guys on the team that haven't been vaccinated. I think it's a personal decision. I'm not going to judge those guys. There are guys that've been vaccinated that have contracted Covid. It's an interesting issue that I think we're going to see played out the entire season.""
The NFL has different rules for when players can return after testing positive for Covid-19, depending on their vaccination status. If Rodgers is, as reported, unvaccinated then he would need to stay away from the team for a minimum of 10 days, meaning the earliest he could return would be on 13 November, one day before Green Bay's game against the Seattle Seahawks. 
Asymptomatic vaccinated players can return as soon as they provide two negative tests 24 hours apart. Vaccinated players displaying symptoms must provide two negative tests 24 hours apart and become asymptomatic.
The Packers have had several issues with Covid in the past few weeks. On Tuesday, Green Bay practice squad quarterback Kurt Benkert tweeted that he had Covid-19. The Packers were without star Davante Adams for last week's victory over the Arizona Cardinals after he tested positive for Covid and his fellow wide receiver Allen Lazard also missed the game after he was deemed a close contact of Adams. The team's defensive coordinator, Joe Barry, has also been absent due to Covid protocols. 
Despite those problems, Green Bay are on a seven-game win streak and have the best record in the NFC (7-1) along with the Cardinals and Los Angeles Rams. Rodgers had been enjoying another vintage year and has thrown 17 touchdowns  and only three interceptions.","AMERICAN FOOTBALL (96%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); VACCINES (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); ATHLETES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (90%)

2021-11-03,Aaron Rodgers reportedly unvaccinated after testing positive for Covid-19,SPORT; Version:1,"It's not surprising that Covid-19 has made people angry: their lives have become disrupted in unimaginable ways. People have lost family members to the disease, or suffered for months with long Covid. With the restrictions needed to keep health services afloat, small businesses have gone under, city centres have been shuttered and people have spent months without seeing loved ones. Basic freedoms that we took for granted were taken away in order to stop the spread of a dangerous virus. The questions of where it came from, and just who is responsible for all this devastation and loss, have assumed outsize importance.
This is perhaps why blame has become central to many discussions, with all the problems that brings. People want to know whose fault Covid-19 is. Professors Zhou Xun and Sander Gilman explore this territory in their book 'I Know Who Caused Covid-19': Pandemics and Xenophobia. The authors examine the experiences of, and attitudes towards, a number of groups that have found themselves in the spotlight at various points: Chinese people, ultra-Orthodox Jews, black and brown people and, finally, Donald Trump-supporting white Americans. Some key themes emerge from their analysis.
First, we must differentiate government responses from those of citizens and scientists. The Chinese government is responsible for its lack of transparency about how Covid-19 first emerged. But its people are not nor are the virologists who released data and genetic sequencing information to colleagues across the world, allowing them to make testing kits and vaccines.
Second, how we name viruses matters. In early 2020, Sars-CoV-2 was labelled the ""Wuhan virus"", and the ""China virus"". Then came the ""Kent variant"" and the ""Indian variant"". All this can lead to entire groups of people being seen as ""unclean"" and ""diseased"". The World Health Organization has tried to rectify the situation by referring to variants using the Greek alphabet (alpha, beta, delta etc), shifting the focus from ""who is to blame"" to ""they're here, how do we manage them"".
Third, fear and uncertainty drive much of the xenophobia discussed in the book. This resonates with the UK Brexit vote.  Lack of familiarity breeds contempt. I am reminded of Brexit, and how it was often areas with the fewest EU migrants that voted to leave, while those with the most were happier about having deep ties to our neighbours. It is easier to feel distrust towards ""all Chinese"" than towards the Chinese person living next door. Ultimately the rhetoric of blame doesn't help to solve any of the problems we currently face. This becomes clear when one considers vaccine hesitancy among some minority communities  (often referred to as BAME in the UK). These groups have been more reluctant to take Covid vaccines, but blaming them only marginalises them further. Instead, engagement, listening and reaching out to understand their concerns are more important in increasing vaccine uptake. Many of these communities' worries are linked to historic episodes of mistreatment by the authorities, themselves the product of earlier cycles of blame. The irony of Covid-19 is that while so many people around the world have experienced the same loneliness, isolation and frustration, the pandemic needn't have led to greater polarisation: it was an opportunity to build solidarity , for people to work collectively to support each other. The final sentence of the book really nails the sentiment underlying this: ""I know who caused Covid-19. THEY did."" Our challenge is to learn how, in future crises, to turn the question from ""who caused Covid-19?"" to ""how do we work together to fix it?""

2021-09-23,'I Know Who Caused Covid-19' review - the global blame game,BOOKS; Version:1,"The death rate of Australians with dementia fell during the Covid-19 pandemic as measures to contain the spread reduced the risk of other infections as well, a new report from the Australian Institute of Health and Welfare has found. The report, Dementia Deaths During the Covid-19 Pandemic in Australia, found the death rate was down during the first 10 months of 2020, with the difference particularly apparent during the winter months when deaths usually peak.
The AIHW looked at mortality data collected by the Australian Bureau of Statistics to examine deaths among people who had dementia recorded on their death certificates between January and October 2020. Of the 858 people who died due to Covid-19 in that period, 30% had dementia.
But the death rate for people with dementia was slightly lower compared with the average rate over the same months during 2015-19, at 58 and 63 deaths per 100,000 population, respectively.
Institute spokeswoman Dr Fleur de Crespigny said: ""Lower rates of death were particularly apparent during the winter months, when there is usually a seasonal peak in deaths of people with dementia."" This is because people living with dementia are particularly vulnerable during infectious disease outbreaks.
""Over the past year, Australia has introduced a range of measures to limit the spread of Covid-19 and treat those affected,"" De Crespigny said.
These measures protected people with dementia from acquiring a range of other infectious diseases that would usually make them more vulnerable to death.
It contrasts with the experience of other developed countries such as the UK where mortality among people with dementia, even when not due to Covid-19, rose during the pandemic, she said. Measures to prevent the spread of Covid-19 included implementing social distancing and, at times, enforcing mask-wearing and lockdowns in areas where outbreaks occurred.
""While early evidence suggests that these measures have assisted in reducing deaths due to other respiratory conditions, it is important to note the impacts of social isolation and loneliness on overall wellbeing, particularly among those living in residential aged care,"" De Crespigny said. The report also found that of the 257 people with dementia who died due to Covid-19, more than half (54%) were women, and most deaths occurred among those aged 85 and over. Almost all the people with dementia who died due to Covid-19 were Victorian residents (95%), with many likely living in one of the 61 residential aged care facilities in Greater Melbourne that experienced fatal Covid-19 outbreaks. The remaining 5% of deaths were among NSW residents.
In an unknown proportion of cases, people who die with dementia do not have the condition recorded in their death certificates, so mortality data will not capture every person who dies with dementia.
Dementia is a collection of symptoms - usually progressive in nature - caused by a range of disorders affecting the brain. The prevalence of dementia increases with age, mainly occurring among those aged 65 and over, and often co-exists with other age-related conditions. The number of Australians with dementia is projected to more than double between 2020 and 2050.
In November, Dementia Australia released a discussion paper on the mental health impact of Covid-19 on people living with dementia, their families and carers in partnership with the University of Sydney, which included recommendations on what should be implemented in the long term.
The CEO of Dementia Australia, Maree McCabe, said recommendations included that a national aged care pandemic response be created, and that risk profiling for people living with dementia, their families and carers receiving aged care services be undertaken to identify particularly vulnerable groups requiring additional support.
""Adequate numbers of staff, with the right skills mix, must also be available to allow continued visits to people living with dementia in residential aged care by their families and friends,"" she said.","DEATH RATES (95%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); DEMENTIA (94%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (91%); DEATH & DYING (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); HEALTH STATISTICS AGENCIES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); CORONAVIRUSES (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (89%); STATISTICS (78%); VIRUSES (78%); FACE MASK MANDATES (73%); RESPIRATORY DISORDERS & INJURIES (73%); SOCIAL ISOLATION (71%); GOVERNMENT STATISTICS AGENCIES (70%)

2021-04-21,Dementia deaths in Australia fell during Covid-19 pandemic,AUSTRALIA NEWS; Version:2,"A Boston-area hospital said it will not perform a heart transplant on a patient who refuses to get a Covid-19 vaccination.
DJ Ferguson, 31, was previously prioritized for a heart transplant at Brigham and Women's hospital, but is no longer eligible as he refuses to get vaccinated, said Ferguson's family, according to a report by CBS Boston.
""It's kind of against his basic principles - he doesn't believe in it,"" said David Ferguson, his father. ""It's a policy they are enforcing and so, because he won't get the shot, they took him off the list [for] a heart transplant.""
Brigham and Women's explained its reasoning in a statement: ""Like many other transplant programs in the United States - the Covid-19 vaccine is one of several vaccines and lifestyle behaviors required for transplant candidates in the Mass General Brigham system in order to create both the best chance for a successful operation and also the patient's survival after transplantation.""
Other medical experts have declared their support of the hospital's policy, noting that the immune system is extremely weak after a transplant, making vaccinations all the more important.
""Post any transplant, kidney, heart whatever, your immune system is shut off. The flu could kill you, a cold could kill you, Covid could kill you,"" said Dr Arthur Caplan, the head of medical ethics at NYU Grossman School of Medicine, told CBS Boston.
""The organs are scarce: we are not going to distribute them to someone who has a poor chance of living when others who are vaccinated have a better chance post-surgery of surviving.""
Ferguson's family have said they are unsure of what to do next given his refusal to receive the Covid-19 vaccine. They have considered transferring him to a different facility but acknowledge he might not survive the trip.
""We are aggressively pursuing all options, but we are running out of time,"" said David Ferguson.
The family said that while had received excellent care at Brigham and Women's, they do not agree with the policy.
""I think my boy is fighting pretty damn courageously, and he has integrity and principles he really believes in, and that makes me respect him all the more,"" said Ferguson of his son, who is a father of two children with another one on the way.

Falling case rates in the US have triggered the relaxation of most public health measures imposed by cities, states and the federal government.
There were roughly 35,000 infections on average over the past week, down sharply from mid-January when the average was closer to 800,000.
According to Johns Hopkins University , the US death toll from the two-year coronavirus pandemic  stood on Sunday at a little over 967,000, from nearly 79.5m cases.
According to the federal Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), 75.2% of US adults are fully vaccinated and 47.7% of the fully vaccinated have received a booster. 
The CDC relaxed its guidelines for indoor masking in late February, taking a more holistic approach that meant the vast majority of Americans live in areas without the recommendation for indoor masking in public.
Resistance to vaccination and other public health measures against Covid is higher in Republican-run states.
The Obamas have homes in Washington DC, Massachusetts and Hawaii, all with more than 70% of the eligible population considered fully protected.

2022-03-13,Barack Obama announces positive test for Covid-19,US NEWS; Version:3,"AstraZeneca boss Pascal Soriot has called on the government to provide access to its Covid-19 medicine Evusheld, saying it's a ""sad situation"" that Britain is one of the few developed nations not to have ordered the drug, designed for those with poor immune systems.
His comments came as the company flagged declining sales of its Covid vaccine, developed with the University of Oxford. Strong performances by other medicines for cancer, diabetes and other conditions catapulted overall sales 60% higher to $11.4bn in the first three months of the year, despite the pandemic affecting cancer diagnosis rates.
Last month the firm received UK regulatory approval  for its long-acting Covid-19 antibody treatment Evusheld , in a boost to its coronavirus portfolio. Aimed at preventing Covid infections in immunocompromised people who cannot be vaccinated, Evusheld had already been approved in the US, France and other countries, and the US government has ordered 1.7m doses. 
It is a combination of two long-acting antibodies that works by binding to the spike protein on the virus's membrane that causes Covid-19, preventing it from attaching to and entering human cells.
""The UK is probably one of the rare developed countries in the world that has not ordered Evusheld. It's a sad situation, quite frankly, because people who are immune-compromised are really suffering from the Covid crisis,"" Soriot said, adding they were at greater risk now that Covid restrictions have been lifted.
""They also represent a pretty large proportion of the people who are hospitalised for Covid, so they do need access to this medicine.""
The Anglo-Swedish drugmaker made sales of $1.1bn from the Covid jab between January and March, and $469m from Evusheld. It has moved away from not-for-profit pricing in new Covid vaccine contracts, but insists that it still supplies it at affordable rates. It reiterated that revenues from the jab are set to decline in coming quarters.
Soriot explained: ""We are no longer in a period of scarcity of vaccine supply. We have oversupply everywhere in the world, so what's out there needs to be used, and then we'll be able to get a better sense for reordering.""
He said the vaccine had shown itself to be a ""very strong booster"". The jab has not yet received approval in the US, and Soriot said the company remains in discussions with the US regulator, and hopes to wrap these up soon.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); VACCINES (90%); CANCER (79%); CANCER DRUGS (79%); DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY (79%); NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS (79%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (78%); NEGATIVE NEWS (77%); SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS (77%); BIOLOGICS MFG (76%); EPIDEMICS (76%); VIRUSES (76%); CORONAVIRUSES (75%); APPROVALS (74%); DIABETES (56%)

2022-04-29,AstraZeneca head calls for UK to provide new Covid-19 medicine to the vulnerable,BUSINESS; Version:1,"Covid-19  infections in California are on the rise, as public health officials in the US west warn  that the more transmissible Delta variant of the coronavirus is fast gaining ground.
For the week-long period ending Tuesday, California saw an average of approximately 1,143 new Covid-19 cases a day, up 30% from mid-June. The increase started shortly after California's reopening on 15 June , the Los Angeles Times reports. 
Covid-19 hospitalizations have also increased by 34% since the middle of June. As of Tuesday, there were 1,228 Covid patients in California hospitals, compared with 915 reported on 12 June. That is still far less than hospitalizations at the pandemic's peak, when hospital admissions totalled almost 22,000.
""This is the call to anyone who hasn't been vaccinated: get vaccinated,"" California's governor, Gavin Newsom, said during a press briefing Wednesday. ""What more evidence do you need?""
The increases reported in California come amid global concern over the threat posed by the Delta or B.1.617.2 variant. In the US, Covid-19 cases are rising  in nearly half of states, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC). The variant is already the dominant strain of Covid-19 in the country, accounting for more than 50% of all new US cases and up to 80% of cases in some regions.
Vaccinations administered in the US, including the Pfizer and Moderna jabs, have been shown to be effective against the Delta variant, but it poses serious risks to those who are unvaccinated.
Across California, the Delta variant accounts for 35.6% of specimens analyzed for variants as of 21 June - an increase from 5.6% in May, the state's public health department said.  In Marin county, 70% of Covid-19 cases are attributed to the variant, the county's public health officer, Dr Matt Willis, told  the local ABC affiliate.
In Los Angeles county, authorities said that the Delta variant comprised almost 50% of assessed Covid-19 cases, up from 5% one month prior, according to the Los Angeles Times. Health officials in the county, which battled a huge Covid-outbreak last winter, have recommended that everyone mask indoors, regardless of whether or not they are vaccinated.
Covid-19 case levels and hospitalizations across the state are still far lower than at the worst stages of the pandemic, despite the recent uptick. California's reported daily Covid-19 deaths are among the lowest in 15 months, averaging 18 deaths a day, a sweeping decline from a high of 537 daily deaths in the weeklong period that ended on 27 January. At present, 3.1 California residents are hospitalized with Covid-19 for every 100,000.
The best defense against the Delta variant is vaccination, and California's vaccination rate is among the highest in the US.
""Almost without exception, everybody that's getting hospitalized, the people who have lost their lives, have been hospitalized or lost their lives because they haven't been vaccinated - period, full stop,"" Newsom said.
While there have been some ""breakthrough"" cases, in which fully vaccinated persons contract Covid-19, the number is exceedingly small. It's not clear how many of those were the result of Delta variant. But multiple studies have shown that two vaccine doses are highly effective  at protecting against hospitalization from the Delta variant.
But disparities on who receives jabs in the state remain. Data from the Los Angeles county health department show  racial disparities in vaccination rates, with Black and Latino persons receiving vaccinations at lower rates. A California Healthline report  earlier this week also revealed that some of the state's rural regions lagged behind with vaccinations.","COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (98%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (96%); PUBLIC HEALTH (93%); VACCINES (91%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (90%); PUBLIC OFFICIALS (90%); COUNTIES (89%); EPIDEMICS (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (79%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); PREVENTION & WELLNESS (78%); VIRUSES (78%); PRESS CONFERENCES (73%)

2021-07-08,Covid-19 infections rising in California as Delta variant gains ground,US NEWS; Version:1,"We all know that person who, despite their entire household catching Covid-19, has never tested positive for the disease. Now scientists have found an explanation, showing that a proportion of people experience ""abortive infection"" in which the virus enters the body but is cleared by the immune system's T-cells at the earliest stage meaning that PCR and antibody tests record a negative result.
About 15% of healthcare workers who were tracked during the first wave of the pandemic in London, England, appeared to fit this scenario.
The discovery could pave the way for a new generation of vaccines targeting the T-cell response, which could produce much longer lasting immunity, scientists said.
Leo Swadling, an immunologist at University College London and lead author of the paper, said: ""Everyone has anecdotal evidence of people being exposed but not succumbing to infection. What we didn't know is whether these individuals really did manage to completely avoid the virus or whether they naturally cleared the virus before it was detectable by routine tests.""
The latest study intensively monitored healthcare workers for signs of infection and immune responses during the first wave of the pandemic. Despite a high risk of exposure 58 participants did not test positive for Covid-19 at any point. However, blood samples taken from these people showed they had an increase in T-cells that reacted against Covid-19, compared with samples taken before the pandemic took hold and compared with people who had not been exposed to the virus at all. They also had increases in another blood marker of viral infection.
The work suggests that a subset of people already had memory T-cells from previous infections from other seasonal coronaviruses causing common colds, which protected them from Covid-19.
These immune cells ""sniff out"" proteins in the replication machinery - a region of Covid-19 shared with seasonal coronaviruses - and in some people this response was quick and potent enough for the infection to be cleared at the earliest stage. ""These pre-existing T-cells are poised ready to recognise SARS-CoV-2,"" said Swadling.
The study adds to the known spectrum of possibilities after exposure to Covid-19, ranging from escaping infection entirely to severe disease.
Alexander Edwards, associate professor in biomedical technology at the University of Reading, said: ""This study identifies [a new] intermediate outcome - enough virus exposure to activate part of your immune system but not enough to experience symptoms, detect significant levels of virus or mount an antibody response."" 
The finding is particularly significant because the T-cell arm of the immune response tends to confer longer lasting immunity, typically of years rather than months, compared with antibodies. Nearly all existing Covid-19 vaccines focus on priming antibodies against the vital spike protein that helps SARS-CoV-2 enter cells. These neutralising antibodies give excellent protection against severe illness. However, the immunity wanes over time and a potential weakness of spike-based vaccines is that this region of the virus is known to mutate.
By contrast, the T-cell response does not tend to fade as quickly and the internal replication machinery that it targets is highly conserved across coronaviruses, meaning a vaccine that also targeted this region would probably protect against new strains - and possibly even against entirely new pathogens.
""Insights from this study could be critical in design of a different type of vaccine,"" said Edwards. ""A vaccine that primes T-cell immunity against different viral protein targets that are shared between many different coronaviruses would complement our spike vaccines that induce neutralising antibodies. Because these are components within the virus, antibodies are less effective - instead, T-cells come into play.""","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); IMMUNOLOGY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS, SCREENING & TESTING (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); VIRUSES (90%); AMINO ACIDS, PEPTIDES & PROTEINS (89%); BIOCHEMISTRY (89%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (89%); SARS (89%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (89%); VACCINES (89%); BIOMEDICINE (78%); IMMUNODIAGNOSTICS (78%); MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY (78%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (74%); COMMON COLD (73%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (69%)

2021-11-10,People testing negative for Covid-19 despite exposure may have 'immune memory',WORLD NEWS; Version:2,"Scores of severely ill Covid-19 sufferers survived because they were given the NHS's highest form of intensive care in which an artificial lung breathes for them, a study  has found.
Patients in the UK who underwent extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) were more likely to survive than those who did not have the treatment, according to the research.
People whose breathing capacity had collapsed were more likely to stay alive if they had ECMO rather than only a spell on a mechanical ventilator.
That is the key finding of an analysis of 1,363 people treated for severe Covid using a ventilator in the UK in between March 2020 and February 2021. They included 243 who were taken by ambulance to either Guy's and St Thomas' or the Royal Brompton and Harefield hospital trust in London to try to save their lives using ECMO.
The other 1,120 were known as what doctors called ""perceived futility"" cases - those it was deemed inappropriate to put on ECMO because they were considered too old and sick to survive Covid, and ECMO was thought unlikely to change their outcome. Doctors also had to consider who would benefit most from the limited availability of artificial life support, which is costly and labour-intensive, at the two specialist centres.
The 243 were matched by computer analysis for their similarity of personal profile and symptoms with 206 of the 1,120 patients who did not receive ECMO to compare their outcomes.
The study, which has been published in the journal Intensive Care Medicine, found that 44% of the non-ECMO group died, while mortality was much lower among those who had the treatment at 26%.
During ECMO, blood is taken out of the unconscious patient's body, put into an oxygenator, has oxygen added and carbon dioxide removed, and is then reinserted into the patient. The hope is that the extra oxygen will improve patients breathing enough to help them pull through.
""ECMO had a substantial effect at saving lives in the UK. Lives were saved due to the significant effort on the part of NHS staff to ramp up ECMO provision to provide service for as many [patients] as possible,"" said Dr Luigi Camporota, a consultant in intensive care medicine at Guy's and St Thomas' who was one of the co-authors.
""Our findings suggest that ECMO delivery at specialist SRF [severe respiratory failure] centres confers significant survival benefit, compared to matched patients who received conventional therapy in referring centres,"" he said.
NHS bosses believe ECMO saved several hundred lives during the pandemic.
Prof Stephen Powis, NHS England's national medical director, said: ""This study is a testament to the incredible hard work of NHS staff over the last two years who have treated more than 700,000 Covid-19 patients in hospital including on ECMO machines, which have helped save hundreds of lives.""
The survival from Covid thanks to ECMO seen in the study is higher than in other studies of its use conducted in other countries. However, the results are not directly comparable because of differences between them such as in the selection criteria for deciding which patients received ECMO and whether people were treated in a general hospital or specialist centre, such as the two hospital trusts in the capital.
In this study, 22.9% of the ECMO and 52.9% of the non-ECMO patients died during the first wave of Covid. Mortality rose in both during the second wave, which occurred during winter 2020-21, to 26.1% and 62.4% respectively.
 This article was amended on 29 April 2022. Carbon dioxide is removed from the blood during ECMO, not added as an earlier version said.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); LEVELS OF CARE (90%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (89%); DEATH & DYING (78%); INTENSIVE CARE UNITS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (78%); RESPIRATORY DISORDERS & INJURIES (78%); RESEARCH REPORTS (73%); PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS (72%); WRITERS (64%)

2022-04-29,External blood oxygenation saved hundreds of Covid-19 sufferers - study,SOCIETY; Version:4,"Bob Enyart, a rightwing talk radio host in Colorado who urged people to boycott vaccines for Covid-19, has died of Covid-19.
Enyart's death was reported  two weeks after the Denver Bible church said he and his wife had been taken to hospital.
""Pastor Bob and Cheryl are in ... good hands and improving daily,"" the church said then. ""We anticipate and pray for a full recovery. We both grieve and rejoice together during this challenging time.""
In a Facebook post  on Monday, Enyart's co-host, Fred Williams, said: ""It comes with an extremely heavy heart that my close friend and co-host of Real Science Radio has lost his battle with Covid.
""Bob Enyart was one of the smartest, and without question the wisest person I've known. All the while being exceedingly kind and humble, and always, always willing to listen and discuss anything you wanted.
""... Heaven's gain has left an enormous hole here on earth.""
In contrast, the Denver Post reported that Enyart was a practiced and brutal provocateur  who once used a show on cable television to mock by name people who died of Aids.
According to a 1999 profile by Westword , Enyart ""gleefully read obituaries of Aids sufferers while cranking Another One Bites the Dust by Queen"".
Enyart also called for women who had abortions to face the death penalty.
Regarding Covid-19 vaccines, Enyart said  people should boycott the shots ""because ...they tested these three products on the cells of aborted babies"".
Last October he successfully sued  the state of Colorado over Covid-related restrictions on church attendance.
Enyart is not the first rightwing radio host to oppose vaccines and other Covid-19 public health measures including mask mandates before dying from Covid-19. 
Four other such hosts have died. 
More than 660,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US. Amid a surge of cases arising from the infectious Delta virus variant, the overwhelming majority of hospitalizations and deaths are among unvaccinated people.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); VACCINES (93%); DEATH & DYING (92%); DEATH NOTICES & OBITUARIES (91%); AIDS & HIV (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS (90%); NEGATIVE MISC NEWS (90%); NEGATIVE NEWS (90%); CONSERVATIVE MEDIA (89%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (89%); ANTI-VACCINE MOVEMENT (78%); RELIGION (77%); FACE MASK MANDATES (73%); PUBLIC HEALTH (73%); ABORTION (64%); CAPITAL PUNISHMENT (50%)

2021-09-14,Colorado radio host who urged boycott of vaccines dies of Covid-19,US NEWS; Version:1,"The latest Covid-19 vaccination figures  show that almost 37 million people in the UK have received their booster jabs, with approximately 52 million people having had their first vaccination and about 48 million their second. But even though huge numbers of the population have had the booster vaccination, a significant proportion of people are still unsure or hesitant about receiving it. Here, we look into concerns around the booster, and find out why it's so vital to have it.
                     Who can have the booster?  Everyone aged 16 and over is now eligible  for a booster vaccine. Also, 12-15-year-olds who are clinically vulnerable are now able to get their booster.
                     Why should I get the booster vaccine?  It's important we take up all vaccinations offered, including boosters, since they deliver the best possible protection against the virus, significantly reducing our risk of serious illness and hospitalisation. Research  shows that unvaccinated people are eight times more likely to be hospitalised than those who have had both doses of the vaccine and a booster. And because the booster vaccine lessens our chances of contracting the virus, it also lessens our chances of suffering from long Covid, which can have serious and debilitating long-term effects.
A&E doctor Dr Emeka Okorocha says: ""I have seen firsthand the effect that Covid-19 can have on people - you can still get seriously ill with the virus. Covid-19 is highly infectious and the vaccine remains our best line of defence against it.""
                     Is the booster jab actually effective against the Omicron variant?  Yes, it is effective. ""Two doses of the vaccine are very good at protecting against the Delta variant but, as we know, the dominant variant now is Omicron,"" says Dr Viki Male, a reproductive immunologist at Imperial College London.
""With Omicron, a third dose boosts protection against hospitalisation up to around 90% ,"" she says.
Dr Lucy Pocock, an academic GP at the University of Bristol, agrees about the benefits. ""It is true that vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease with Omicron is lower than with the Delta variant, however protection against hospitalisation is much greater after a booster dose, so it's really important people take them up when they are offered.""
                     I'm concerned about the side-effects of the vaccine. Is the booster safe?                     Yes, the booster has been approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency  (MHRA). ""In the UK, most people are offered an mRNA vaccine (Pfizer or Moderna) as a booster,"" says Pocock. ""Millions of people worldwide have now received doses of these vaccines with the risk of serious side-effects being very low. Symptoms people have experienced - such as short-term pain and swelling at the injection site, fatigue or a headache - are usually mild and only last for a couple of days.""
If, on the other hand, you test positive for Covid-19, you may need to take significant time off work to isolate and recover from the illness.
                     I had my second dose of the vaccine not long ago. When can I get a booster vaccine?  You can get a Covid-19 booster vaccine three months after your second dose. ""If you weren't able to get your booster dose because you had Covid-19, remember to book your booster jab 28 days after you no longer have the virus too,"" says Okorocha.
                     I am immunosuppressed and more vulnerable to infection. What should I do?  In certain circumstances - for example, for people who are immunosuppressed - it's even more important you are protected against the virus. In which case, you may be eligible to receive a booster vaccination sooner. If you haven't had yours, go to the NHS.uk  website to book an appointment or to find your local walk-in vaccination centre.
                     I've already had two doses of the Covid-19 vaccine, am I not protected enough?  Unfortunately not. Taking up a booster will strengthen protection against serious illness from Covid-19 and give you the best possible defence for you, your family and anybody you come into contact with.
                     I'm pregnant and I'm concerned about the efficacy of the vaccine. Why should I get it?  If you're pregnant, it's even more important you take up the booster as soon as you can. Research  shows that pregnant and recently pregnant women with Covid-19 are more likely to be admitted to an intensive care unit than non-pregnant women.
Data  from the UK Obstetric Surveillance System also indicates that 96% of pregnant women admitted to hospital with Covid-19 symptoms between May and October 2021 were unvaccinated, and a third of these required respiratory support.
About one in five pregnant women hospitalised with the virus need to deliver babies preterm, and one in five of their babies need care in the neonatal unit. ""Along with a higher risk of preterm birth for women with symptomatic Covid-19, UK studies have also suggested a higher rate of stillbirth in infected women,"" says Pocock.
                     But does research indicate that it's definitely safe if I'm pregnant?  Yes, it does. ""Safety trials of the booster have shown that, in the general population, the booster doesn't have any side effects that we don't see with doses one and two,"" says Male.
"" Safety studies  looking at more than 100,000 people who received doses one and two during pregnancy have shown that there's no increased risk of pregnancy complications with the vaccines. Putting those two together, we have every reason to believe that, just like doses one and two, boosters are completely safe during pregnancy.""
Pocock agrees, saying: ""The Covid-19 vaccines are safe for pregnant women and have no impact on fertility, either.""
                     I don't have time to get a booster jab, is it                       really                     that important?  The Covid-19 vaccine is quick, simple and free. It has never been easier to get jabbed - you can get it near your home or work, and at a time that's convenient (including the weekend or evenings). Either book online or visit a walk-in centre - and encourage friends and family who haven't had theirs to book in, too. ""It can be difficult to make time in a busy schedule for the booster,"" says Pocock. ""But having symptomatic Covid-19, or even long Covid, is likely to be much more disruptive to your life. Appointments are on offer on weekends and evenings, and are quick and easy. Think of it as an investment in your health and future productivity.""

2022-01-28,Covid-19 booster vaccines: experts answer common concerns for people worried about getting their latest jab,ALL TOGETHER; Version:1,"The Covid-19 death toll in the US has now surpassed 700,000, despite the Covid-19 vaccines' wide availability, in what one expert called a ""tragic and completely avoidable milestone"".
Data  from Johns Hopkins University shows that the US went just past 700,000 deaths on Friday; the US had previously reached  600,000 deaths in June. The country has had a total of 43.6m confirmed cases of Covid-19 since the start of the pandemic, according to Johns Hopkins.
Over the last few months, the overwhelming majority of people who died from Covid were unvaccinated. A study  from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) published last month found that after the Delta variant became the most common variant in the US over the summer, unvaccinated Americans were 10 times more likely to be hospitalised and die because of the virus compared with vaccinated Americans.
In a statement on Saturday, Joe Biden said: ""To heal we must remember, and as our nation mourns the painful milestone of 700,000 American deaths ... we must not become numb to the sorrow. On this day, and every day, we remember all those we have lost to this pandemic and we pray for their loved ones left behind who are missing a piece of their soul.
""As we do, the astonishing death toll is yet another reminder of just how important it is to get vaccinated.""
Recent deaths have primarily been in southern states that have lagging vaccine rates, including Florida, Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana. Nationally, about 65% of people 12 and older who are eligible to receive the vaccine have been fully vaccinated, according to the CDC. 
With a slight majority of the population fully vaccinated, the Covid death rate has significantly decreased compared with the death rate during previous surges of the virus, when the vaccine was unavailable. Following the surge in cases seen last winter, 100,000 people died  in a 34-day period between January and February. Comparatively, it took over three months for the US to see another 100,000 deaths this summer.
Public health experts attribute the slowed death rate to the effectiveness of the vaccine but say that the milestone could have been avoided altogether with a higher vaccination rate.
""Reaching 700,000 deaths is a tragic and completely avoidable milestone. We had the knowledge and the tools to prevent this from happening, and unfortunately politics, lack of urgency and mistrust in science got us here,"" John Brownstein, an epidemiologist at Boston children's hospital, told ABC News. 
Experts are hoping that hospitalizations and deaths will decrease as the surge in cases due to the Delta variant seems to be decreasing and vaccine mandates are starting to roll out.
Without a winter surge, which experts say is still possible, statistical modeling  has shown that the Covid-19 cases can continue to decline into 2022, providing some much-needed relief to hospital systems across the country that have been overwhelmed by Covid-19 cases.
One hospital in rural Washington state is still dealing with a surge of patients, with 15 of its 20 intensive-care unit beds being occupied by Covid patients. The hospital has had to delay more than two dozen heart surgeries because of its shortage of ICU beds.
""We've got a backup of like 30 cases that need to be done,"" Jackie Whited, director of intensive care at Central Washington hospital in Wenatchee, Washington, told the Seattle Times. ""I have no beds, I will have one clean bed in the ICU.""
In an effort to get more people inoculated, vaccine mandates have been rolling out across the country, to some success.
Major health systems in California, where healthcare workers have been required to get vaccinated, have reported an uptick in vaccination rates among staff members. New York, which has a similar mandate, has seen similar results with thousands of healthcare workers getting vaccinated  before the state's vaccination deadline.
United Airlines had said it would fire the nearly 600 employees out of its workforce of about 67,000 employees who refused to be vaccinated. On Thursday, the company said that nearly 250 of those employees ultimately decided to get vaccinated.
""Our vaccine policy continues to prove requirements work - in less than 48 hours, the number of unvaccinated employees who began the process of being separated from the company has been cut almost in half, dropping from 592 to 320,"" the company said in a statement. 
Adding to further optimism that the virus's hold on the country is waning was the drug manufacturer Merck's announcement  on Friday that research found its Covid-19 treatment pill reduced hospitalizations and death to the virus by half. The company said it was seeking emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for distribution of the pill.","COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (95%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); VACCINES (94%); PUBLIC HEALTH (91%); DEATH & DYING (90%); DEATH RATES (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); PREVENTION & WELLNESS (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); THIS DAY IN HISTORY (77%); DISEASE REPORTING (76%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (73%); MANDATORY VACCINATIONS (73%); STATISTICAL METHOD (72%)

2021-10-02,"'Tragic and completely avoidable': US hits 700,000 Covid-19 deaths",WORLD NEWS; Version:5,"Flu season is upon us again - and this year, we're still busy protecting ourselves from Covid-19, too. Due to lockdown restrictions and the lack of mixing between households last winter, the number of flu cases dropped significantly - but that also means our immunity to flu might now be lower than before the pandemic.
Approximately 11,000 people die from flu in England on average each year, and most cases occur in winter, when the cold weather encourages transmission, and we begin mixing indoors in less well-ventilated spaces.
Alongside flu, continuing or rising cases of coronavirus are expected this winter, creating a double risk. The latest data shows that protection provided by Covid-19 vaccines falls after six months, particularly for older adults and at-risk groups. As viruses can spread quickly from person to person when we're in close proximity indoors over winter, it's important to book your appointment for the flu jab and Covid-19 vaccine booster, according to your eligibility for one or both. While most people have two doses of a Covid-19 vaccine as part of their ""primary"" course and many are now eligible for a booster, vaccination experts have recommended three doses in the primary course for people who have a severely weakened immune system, to get a good level of protection against Covid-19.
If you have not already received your primary doses of a Covid-19 vaccine, then now is the time to do it.
As well as boosting your own immunity, these essential vaccines could help prevent people who might be more vulnerable from becoming seriously ill, and in turn help reduce pressure on the NHS.
""Both flu and Covid-19 cost lives, and the increased threat from these two deadly viruses this winter makes it even more important that anyone eligible comes forward for a flu vaccine as soon as possible, and books in their Covid-19 booster when they're invited,"" says NHS deputy vaccination programme lead Dr Nikki Kanani. ""The vaccines are safe, effective, and the best thing you can do to protect yourself and your loved ones this winter.""
Here, we've answered your key questions on both vaccinations, so we can all stay safe this season.
                   Your guide to the Covid-19 booster vaccine                   
                     Who is eligible for a Covid-19 booster vaccine?  The third shot is designed to ensure the most vulnerable people in our communities are protected over winter. More than 8m jabs including boosters and third doses have been administered and currently the following people are eligible:
                                                               Those aged 50 and over.                                                                 Those aged 16 and over with a health condition that puts them at high risk of getting seriously ill from Covid-19.                                                                 Those who live or work in care homes.                                                                 Frontline health and social care workers.                                                           
                     How soon after my second dose will a booster be offered to those who are eligible?  The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation advises that you'll be offered your booster vaccine no earlier than six months (182 days) after your second dose of the Covid-19 vaccine. People with certain health conditions may be offered the Covid-19 booster earlier.
                     Where will booster vaccine appointments be available?                     Once invited for your vaccine you can book an appointment online or by calling 119. The booster vaccine is being delivered from a range of locations such as walk-in and mobile vaccination sites to make accessing it as convenient as possible. Primary care teams will vaccinate care home staff and residents on-site, while health and social care workers can book their booster vaccinations through their employer.
                     I've recently tested positive for Covid-19 - can I still get a booster vaccine?  As always, if you've tested positive for coronavirus, you need to self-isolate for 10 full days. You should wait 28 days before booking your booster vaccine, starting from the date you took the positive test.
                   Your guide to the flu vaccine                   
                     Who is eligible for the flu vaccine?  If you get flu and Covid-19 viruses at the same time, research shows you're more likely to get seriously ill. A free flu jab is available to people in the following categories:
                                                               Children aged from two years* up to secondary school year 11.                                                                 People aged 50 or over.                                                                 Those aged six months to under 50 years in clinical risk groups, (see the NHS website for a full list of conditions and clinical risk groups).                                                                 People who are pregnant.                                                                 People who live or work in care homes.                                                                 Close contacts of immunocompromised individuals and their carers.                                                                 Health and social care staff. All frontline health and social care workers are expected to have the flu vaccine.                                                           Why might we be more vulnerable to flu this year?                   
In the 2020/21 season, we didn't see much flu, partly thanks to the measures put in place to stop Covid-19 and the reduction in international travel.
Because there were so few cases last season, more strains of flu might be in circulation this year, plus there's less immunity against last year's strains, too. Regardless of your eligibility for a Covid-19 booster vaccine, anyone who is eligible for a flu jab on the NHS should take the opportunity to book theirs ASAP.
If you're eligible, you'll be able to book your jab at your GP surgery, at a pharmacy if you're over 18 (which can be found at nhs.uk/flujab  ), via a hospital appointment, or through your midwife service if you're pregnant. If your child is school age, they should be offered their flu vaccine through their school.
                     Does my child need the flu vaccination?  All children from the age of two to those in year 11 at secondary school, and all children in at-risk groups from the age of six months are eligible to receive a flu vaccine. Children aged from two years to those in school year 11 will be offered the nasal spray vaccine. Where the nasal spray is not suitable for them, those who are between six months and two years will be offered the flu injection.
                     I'm pregnant - is it safe to get the Covid and flu jabs?  Yes - both are safe for pregnant women, and it's important to have both if eligible. There are more risks for you and your pregnancy if you contract Covid-19 without the vaccine, and the flu vaccine will also help protect your unborn baby.
If you catch flu when pregnant, you're at risk from complications such as bronchitis and it could cause your baby to be born prematurely, have a low birthweight and may even lead to stillbirth. If you're pregnant, you can get a free flu vaccine from your GP, pharmacist or through your maternity service.
* Applies only to children who were aged two on 31 August 2021. Any child that has turned two since this date will not yet be eligible.
                     Vaccines are the best protection against life-threatening viruses like flu and Covid-19. For more information and to book your appointment visit nhs.uk/wintervaccinations
                   'You should take all the sensible precautions you can'                   
                     Helen Baimbridge, 44, runs the TinCup social media marketing agency, and lives in Haddenham, Buckinghamshire                   
""I've already had my Covid-19 booster and flu jab, both of which my GP got in touch with me about. I have Crohn's disease, which means I have a compromised immune system and am in the clinically extremely vulnerable category, so I received my first jab in the first tier of the vaccine rollout, and my second at the end of March.
""Because those of us who are immunosuppressed might have a less than adequate response to the vaccine, and its effect diminishes after six months, I was very happy to get the booster - I think the vaccine rollout overall has been excellent.
""I always make sure I have my flu jab early in the season, too, because it's the smallest thing I can do to keep myself safer - but this year, with the risk of flu even higher than usual, it was absolutely something I wanted to prioritise. Why wouldn't you avoid getting flu if you possibly could? You should take all the sensible precautions that you can.""

2021-11-05,The Covid-19 booster and flu vaccines: what you need to know this winter,ALL TOGETHER; Version:1,"In moves reminiscent of the environment for the 2020 season, the NFL has updated its protocols and advocated for booster shots in reaction to an increase in Covid-19 cases around the league.
As part of its protocol changes, it is requiring masks regardless of vaccination status, and remote or outdoor meetings. It also is stopping in-person meals, adding restrictions on activities outside the facility, prohibiting outside visitors during team travel, and limiting the amount of people in team weight rooms.
""Finally, and based on expert advice, we will adjust the return-to-participation requirements for those who have recovered from Covid-19,"" the league said in a statement. ""All of these changes are grounded in our data and science-backed approach, with safety our No 1 goal for the entire NFL community.""
The updated protocols will be enforced through Week 15 games, but are likely to continue or even be strengthened after that point.
Dr Allen Sills, the league's chief medical officer, said the omicron variant of the coronavirus is ""in many ways (like) addressing a new disease."" Omicron is responsible for the significant uptick in positive Coviid-19 cases, according to Sills, which are emanating from within team facilities. That is the opposite of where previous positives had come from right after Thanksgiving.
The league and the players' union, advised by independent infectious disease officers, have developed a mechanism in the protocols that might lead to shorter stints on the sidelines for people testing positive.
Previously, a vaccinated person - players, coaches, executives and staffers - who tests positive must then have two negative tests 24 hours apart and be asymptomatic before being cleared to return. Beginning immediately, the new protocols relax that requirement a bit, allowing for two PCR tests or two Mesa tests - or one of each - being negative. The logistics for that could speed up the return of sidelined players.
""We have to think differently about this phase of the pandemic,"" Sills said. ""We are facing a different set of challenges and in some ways almost a different disease... and it is going to require a different (strategy) from us.""
The 32 teams also were told Thursday that they may continue current media policies that include media wearing masks at all times in a club facility. But the teams can also shift to virtual interviews for the rest of this week, something a few of them already have done.
Also Thursday:
 The Chicago Bears were missing all three of their coordinators because of Covid-19 protocols as they prepared for Monday night's home game against the Minnesota Vikings. And they had seven players out because of illnesses.
Bears coach Matt Nagy said offensive coordinator Bill Lazor, defensive coordinator Sean Desai and special teams coordinator Chris Tabor were participating remotely in meetings this week. Their status for the game is uncertain.
Covid-19 has hit the Bears hard this week, one of many teams experiencing positive tests. Approximately 100 players across the 32 teams have tested positive.
Nagy said non-Covid illness is running through the team and kept running back David Montgomery, guard James Daniels, tackle Teven Jenkins, return man Jakeem Grant, tight end Cole Kmet, tight end Jesper Horsted and running back Khalil Herbert sidelined on Thursday.
Chicago put five players on the Covid-19 reserve list since Monday, and a practice squad member: tackle Larry Borom, tackle Elijah Wilkinson, nose tackle Eddie Goldman, cornerback Artie Burns, defensive tackle Mario Edwards Jr., and practice squad linebacker Sam Kamara.
Nagy missed a game earlier this year against San Francisco, a 33-22 loss, because of Covid-19 issues, and Tabor coached the Bears.
 Washington placed three more players on the Covid-19 list Thursday, following eight Wednesday. The team total is 21, including two players on injured reserve and two on the practice squad. Safety Sam Curl was the only starter added to the list, and was joined by centers Keith Ismael and Tyler Larsen.
Curl joins fellow defensive starters in lineman Jon Allen and cornerback Kendall Fuller on the list. Washington could be down to ther fifth option at center because of coronavirus and injury problems.
 Seattle might be without one of its stars, receiver Tyler Lockett, who was put on the COVID-19 list Thursday along with running back Alex Collins. The Seahawks had no players test positive in the 2020 season, but have had three this year: Tight end Gerald Everett was the other in September.
Lockett has a team-high 62 receptions for 1,023 yards and six touchdowns. Last week Lockett became the second player in franchise history with three straight seasons with at least 1,000 yards receiving, joining Hall of Famer Steve Largent.
Lockett had five catches for 142 yards and a touchdown last week against Houston and is 35 yards short of setting a career high for a season.
Collins has served as a starter for most of this season after Chris Carson was lost to a season-ending neck injury in Week 4. But Collins has played through several ailments.
 Cleveland might be down to third-string quarterback Nick Mullens after Case Keenum joined Baker Mayfield in the protocols , according to a person with knowledge of the situation who spoke anonymously because the move was not announced.
Tight end David Njoku was activated from the Coviid-19 list, adding a playmaker heading into Saturday's game against Las Vegas. On Wednesday, the virus shelved coach Kevin Stefanski and Mayfield, whose status for this week remains in question. The Browns previously had 17 players, including 10 starters, on the Covid-19 list and are placing safety Ronnie Harrison there. Starting safety James Johnson III and nickel back Troy Hill both tested positive on Wednesday and rookie cornerback Greg Newsome II has been ruled out with a concussion.
 Saints coach Sean Payton returned to practice on Thursday after staying home on Wednesday, when the team said the coach was ""under the weather,"" but had tested negative for Covid-19.
Payton had participated in a conference call with reporters on Wednesday morning without mentioning he'd be missing practice later that day. The Saints said Payton worked from home and participated in meetings via videoconference on Wednesday before returning to team headquarters on Thursday.
 Miami rookie receiver Jaylen Waddle's sensational season could be on hold. Waddle has been placed in the coronavirus protocol. The sixth overall draft pick already set a franchise record for receptions by a rookie with 86. He has 849 yards receiving and four touchdowns.
The Dolphins host the Jets on Sunday.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (96%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (95%); VACCINES (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (90%); FACE MASK MANDATES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); AMERICAN FOOTBALL (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); SAFETY (89%); COACHES & TRAINERS (79%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (79%); INTERVIEWS (78%); THANKSGIVING (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); EPIDEMICS (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH (77%); CORONAVIRUSES (72%); EXECUTIVES (72%); VIRUSES (72%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (67%)

2021-12-16,NFL 's 'significant changes' to Covid-19 protocols will allow faster player return,SPORT; Version:1,"The United States has donated more than 400m vaccine doses to 112 countries, marking a major milestone in the White House's goal of donating 1.2bn vaccine doses under Joe Biden's direction.
In a press briefing on Wednesday, the White House Covid-19 response coordinator, Jeff Zients, said the donation is four times larger than that of any other country.
Zients also revealed that the country hit another major milestone this week, with 70% of eligible seniors in the US having now received their booster shot. Half of all eligible adults in the country are now boosted.
""This is significant progress, as the doctors and data have made crystal clear. Vaccinations and boosters provide the best protection,"" Zients said.
The daily averages of cases and hospital admissions have fallen over the past week, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).
The current seven-day average of Covid-19 cases is approximately 692,400 cases a day, a 6% decrease from the previous week, while the seven-day average of hospital admissions is about 19,800 a day, an 8% decrease.
However, the figure for seven-day average daily deaths is about 2,200 a day, an increase of 21%.
""These data demonstrate that Covid-19 disease severity appears to be lower with the Omicron variant than with prior variants,"" saidDr Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC. ""Although it's encouraging that Omicron appears to be causing less severe disease, it is important to remember that we are still facing a high overall burden of disease.
""Milder does not mean mild,"" the director added. ""Now is the time to do what we know works: wear a mask, get vaccinated and get boosted.""
Speaking at the press briefing, Dr Anthony Fauci, director of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Disease, said that scientists have been working on developing a ""pan-coronavirus"" vaccine, in order to induce ""broad and durable protection against coronaviruses that are known, and some that are even at this point, unknown"".
Nevertheless, those vaccines would take years to develop, he said. ""I don't want anyone to think that pan-coronavirus vaccines are literally around the corner in a month or two.""
Zients also told reporters that approximately 85% of the Covid-19 antiviral pills  that the US has purchased has been directly distributed to states. This has been done ""the same way we distribute vaccines - for them to then put the pills in the most important places within their states, at local hospitals and health systems and other caregivers"", Zients said.
The remaining 15% will be distributed directly to community health centers around the country, he added.
Earlier this month, Biden announced that the US would purchase 20m of Pfizer's Covid-19 antiviral pill Paxlovid, doubling its previous order of 10m. In data  released by Pfizer last December, the pill was estimated to have reduced the risk of hospitalization or death due to Covid by 89% in high-risk adults.","VACCINES (97%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); CORONAVIRUSES (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); PRESS CONFERENCES (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH (89%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (89%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (89%); VIRUSES (89%); PREVENTION & WELLNESS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (69%); COMMUNITY HEALTH PROGRAMS (68%)

2022-01-26,"US donated over 400m Covid-19 vaccine doses to 112 countries, says White House",WORLD NEWS; Version:2,"People who were fully vaccinated accounted for just 1.2% of all deaths involving Covid-19 in England in the first seven months of this year.
The figures, published by the Office for National Statistics  (ONS), have been seized on  as proof of the success of the vaccine programme.
The figures show a total of 51,281 deaths involving Covid-19 in England between 2 January and 2 July, of which 38,964 were of unvaccinated people. 
Of the total Covid-related deaths, 458 (about 0.9%) were of people who died at least 21 days after their second vaccine dose. Just 256 deaths (0.5%) were of people who were fully vaccinated and had their first positive PCR test at least 14 days after their second dose.
No vaccine is 100% effective against Covid-19, and health authorities have made it clear that some deaths of vaccinated individuals are to be expected. Public Health England (PHE) has estimated  that two-dose effectiveness against hospital admission with infections from the Delta variant - which is now the UK's dominant strain - has been around 94%.
However, the figures on Monday underlined that the risk of death involving Covid-19 is consistently lower for people who have received two doses compared with one dose or no vaccination at all.
 Age-standardised mortality rates for deaths involving #COVID19  are consistently lower for people who have received two vaccinations https://t.co/EkaAS1MNTT pic.twitter.com/3EpkfaNsOl  - Office for National Statistics (ONS) (@ONS) September 13, 2021
A detailed breakdown of data was made available for 252 of the 256 people who died after having received both jabs and who first tested positive at least 14 days after the second dose. They are what the ONS describes as ""breakthrough"" deaths.
It shows that just over three-quarters of these deaths (76.6%) occurred in those who were clinically extremely vulnerable - a slightly higher proportion than for other Covid-19 deaths (74.5%) and deaths not involving Covid-19 (69.7%).
Of the breakthrough deaths, 61.1% occurred in males, which is higher than for other Covid-19 deaths (52.2%) and deaths not involving Covid-19 (48.5%), while 13% were among people who were immunocompromised.
Experts emphasised the importance of context in terms of the data, which covered a period when the seven-day average daily UK deaths varied between six and more than 1,200 per day. Trends were increasing at the end of the ONS study period, when rates were about 25 per day while daily death rates are now consistently over 100 per day.
Dr Duncan Robertson, a data analyst at Loughborough University, said: ""By definition, as the proportion of vaccinated people increases, fewer remain in the unvaccinated category. In the extreme, if everyone were vaccinated, 100% of deaths would be of vaccinated people, just as before the vaccine rollout, 0% of deaths would be of vaccinated people.""
But he added: ""What is clear from the ONS data is the significance of being fully vaccinated - full vaccination offers very high - but not perfect - protection against death, where only having a first dose offers significantly less protection.""
The PNS data came days after Public Health England published figures  showing the vaccination status of individuals infected, hospitalised, and those who died.
""While figures for protection against infection needs careful interpretation, particularly in the estimates of population in each age category, it is clear that vaccine protection against death is very high after the second dose,"" added Dr Robertson, who stressed that work still needed to be done to ensure that vaccinations reach those in cohorts where there had already been significant uptake.
There are about 1 million over-60s who are not fully vaccinated, he pointed out. Only two-thirds of black over-50s have been vaccinated compared to more than 9 in 10 white over-50s. People are four times more likely to not be fully vaccinated if they live in the most deprived areas compared with those living in the least deprived areas.

2021-09-13,Fully vaccinated people account for 1.2% of England's Covid-19 deaths,WORLD NEWS; Version:3,"The virus that causes Covid-19 does not infect human brain cells, according to a new study  published in the journal Cell.
The findings will raise hopes that the damage caused by Sars-CoV-2 might be more superficial and reversible than previously feared.
The study contradicts earlier research  which suggested that the virus infects neurons in the membrane that lines the upper recesses of the nose.
This membrane, called the olfactory mucosa, is where the virus first lands when it is inhaled. Within it are olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) - which are responsible for initiating smell sensations.
They are tightly entwined with a kind of support cell called sustentacular cells.
In the new study, Belgian and German researchers claim that the virus infects sustentacular cells - but not OSNs.
""That is just a critical distinction,"" says senior author Peter Mombaerts, who directs the Max Planck Research Unit for Neurogenetics in Frankfurt, Germany.
""Once you believe that olfactory neurons can be infected, there is a quick route into the olfactory bulb and then you're in the brain already.""
The olfactory bulb, at the front of the brain, is where neural input about odours is first processed.
If the virus penetrated this structure it could theoretically spread to deeper brain regions where it could do lasting damage - especially since, unlike OSNs, most neurons are not regenerated once lost.
But if the virus only infects the sustentacular cells, then the damage could be less long lasting.
Both pathways could explain the olfactory dysfunction that afflicts an estimated half of Covid-19 patients.
In one in 10 of those, the loss or change of smell is long-term, perhaps permanent.
Prof Mombaerts says this could be the result of support for the OSNs breaking down, even if they themselves are not infected.
They might function below par - or stop functioning altogether - until the sustentacular cells regenerate.
The group has not looked at other neurological symptoms of Covid-19, such as the fatigue and ""brain fog"" that accompany long Covid.
Nobody doubts that the central nervous system (CNS) is affected by the disease; the debate concerns whether these effects are due to the virus infecting neurons or some more indirect mechanism, such as an inflammatory response in the blood irrigating the brain - with different implications for prognosis and treatment.
The findings are likely to prove controversial because of the difficulty of studying molecular events unfolding in the moments after infection. Earlier studies made use of animal models , clusters of neural stem cells grown in a dish , and postmortem tissue  taken from small numbers of Covid-19 patients. The present study is the largest in Covid-19 patients to date, and it also deployed a novel technique for capturing those early events.
Laura Van Gerven, a neurosurgeon at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium, another of the paper's senior authors, adapted a form of skull base surgery  to remove tissue from the olfactory mucosa and bulb of Covid-19 patients within about an hour of their death. In 30 of the patients, the researchers were able to detect that the virus was still replicating - meaning the patients had died in the acute, contagious phase of the disease.
""It is unquestionably the most thoroughly done bit of work on human postmortem olfactory Covid tissue,"" says Stuart Firestein , a neurobiologist at Columbia University in New York City.
But Prof Firestein says the results don't shed much new light on how Covid-19 causes olfactory dysfunction. ""They do not show any OSNs as being damaged or there being fewer of them, or the OSNs near infected sustentacular cells as being different in any way from those not near infected cells,"" he says.
Debby Van Riel , a virologist at Erasmus University in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, also praises the study's rigour, but calls its authors' claim that Sars-CoV-2 does not infect neurons ""pretty bold"".
In only six of the 30 patients was the virus detectable in the olfactory mucosa itself. ""Overall the numbers are thus really low to make any strong conclusions,"" she says.
But even if the study isn't the last word on Covid's brain effects, it does indicate that those dire early reports weren't either.
If its conclusions are borne out, those experiencing Covid-related anosmia or parosmia  can be reassured that the virus has not infected their brains, and that future therapies targeting the understudied sustentacular cells could alleviate or cure their condition.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (95%); BRAIN (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); VIRUSES (93%); RESEARCH REPORTS (92%); CORONAVIRUSES (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); RESPIRATORY DISORDERS & INJURIES (90%); NEUROSCIENCE (89%); SARS (89%); BIOETHICS (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS & INJURIES (78%); WRITERS (73%); PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS (65%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (62%)

2021-11-03,"Covid-19 virus does not infect human brain cells, new study suggests",WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"Italy's prime minister has announced his government could make Covid-19 vaccines mandatory, sparking a row in the country that has seen a recent rise in protests and violence from anti-vaxxers.
During a press conference on Thursday , Mario Draghi said all Italians of eligible age could soon be obliged to get a shot, as soon as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) gives its conditional approval for four vaccines.
The news sparked protests by anti-vaxxers who, in recent days, have sent death threats to members of the government, virologists, health officials and journalists, because of their pro-vax stances.
Prosecutors in Turin on Tuesday have launched an investigation into an antivax chat group on Telegram , where members posted death threats against foreign minister, Luigi Di Maio.
""Another rat to be executed,"" ""We need lead,"" and ""You must die,"" were some of the messages.
On Sunday night, a top virologist and expert in infectious diseases at Genoa's San Martino hospital, Matteo Bassetti, was approached by a man , who started following him and shouting, ""You're going to kill all of us with these vaccines and we're going to make you pay.""
The next day, during a sit-in outside the education ministry by anti-vaxxers, a journalist from the Italian national newspaper La Repubblica was attacked by a protester who punched him in the face. 
Draghi expressed ""full solidarity to all those who have been subjected to the hateful and cowardly violence on the part of anti-vaxxers.""
The protests began after the government extended the Covid-19 green pass - a digital or paper certificate that shows whether someone has received at least one Covid-19 vaccine dose, or a negative Covid test, taken no more than 48 hours before using trains, planes, ferries and coaches. In Italy, the green pass is also needed for long-distance travel and is mandatory for school workers.
In Turin, some teachers announced they had launched a lawsuit against a school principal, after they were prevented from entering classes without green passes. 
Draghi, who has said 80% of Italians will be vaccinated against Covid-19 by the end of September, announced that his government is working to further extend the use of the green pass to other leisure activities, as the country could become the first in Europe to make the vaccination mandatory for all, when EU health authorities give their full approval.
According to media reports, EMA could reach a final decision by the end of next week.
The news in Italy has caused numerous tensions even within the ruling coalition. League leader, Matteo Salvini, said he will vote ''no'', citing his party will always be ""against obligations, fines and discrimination.""
Currently, in Italy, the vaccine is mandatory only for medical workers. The country was the first to introduce compulsory vaccinations for doctors, followed by France.
At the moment, only Indonesia, the federated states of Micronesia and Turkmenistan have introduced compulsory vaccinations for all.
In the rest of the world, jabs are mandatory only for certain categories of workers.
In Greece, all healthcare workers will have to be vaccinated by the end of September. In the UK, starting in October, it will be mandatory for nursing home operators.
Early in August, France passed a law that made vaccinations mandatory for health workers, while Russia ordered all workers with public facing roles to be vaccinated against Covid-19, with companies given a month to ensure at least 60% of staff had received first doses, or they would face fines, or temporary closure.
The US president, Joe Biden, has urged local governments to pay people to get vaccinated and establish new rules, requiring federal workers to provide proof of vaccination, or face regular testing, mask mandates and travel restrictions.","VACCINES (94%); ANTI-VACCINE MOVEMENT (93%); NEGATIVE MISC NEWS (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); MANDATORY COVID VACCINATIONS (90%); MANDATORY VACCINATIONS (90%); NEGATIVE NEWS (90%); PRIME MINISTERS (90%); TRENDS & EVENTS (90%); VIROLOGY (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (89%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (89%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (89%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (89%); JOURNALISM (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (89%); VACCINE CERTIFICATIONS & PASSPORTS (89%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (87%); IMMUNITY CERTIFICATIONS & PASSPORTS (85%); EUROPEAN UNION (79%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); DISCRIMINATION (78%); EDUCATION DEPARTMENTS (78%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (78%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (78%); MICROBIOLOGY (78%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (78%); PRESS CONFERENCES (78%); PUBLIC OFFICIALS (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); VIRUSES (78%); APPROVALS (76%); INVESTIGATIONS (75%); WRITERS (75%); LITIGATION (74%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (73%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (73%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (70%); PUBLIC PROSECUTORS (69%); EDUCATION ADMINISTRATION (65%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (65%); SUITS & CLAIMS (62%); SCHOOL PRINCIPALS (61%)

2021-09-03,"Italy could soon make Covid-19 vaccines mandatory, says PM",WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"With Christmas just around the corner, the opportunity to celebrate and reunite with loved ones after a difficult year is almost upon us. But Covid-19 still poses a very real threat because of the new Omicron variant and the increase in social interactions anticipated over the coming weeks.
Every adult in the country now needs to get a Covid-19 booster vaccine, because two doses does not give you enough protection against catching Omicron. Get your booster now at nhs.uk/covidvaccination. 
""Get boosted now"" is the best way to protect ourselves against Omicron. This mission is more urgent and more important than ever before with Covid-19 because Omicron Covid-19 is spreading fast. Vaccines are the best way we can protect ourselves.
You can get a Covid-19 booster 12 weeks after your second dose. Boosters give you the best possible protection against the virus and should significantly reduce your risk of serious illness and hospitalisation.
With cases of Covid-19 rising, new measures have been implemented - such as face coverings becoming mandatory for some indoor public venues, including places of worship, theatres and cinemas, as well as in shops and on public transport. People have also been advised to resume working from home where possible, while access to certain venues, including nightclubs, requires Covid certification (or negative rapid lateral flow test).
Despite stricter new rules, it's still crucial we continue to follow other safety measures over the holidays to protect ourselves and loved ones, says GP partner Dr Luke Gardner, from the Park Surgery, in Great Yarmouth, Norfolk. ""This Christmas, I will be spending the day with a few members of my close family,"" he says. ""As far as gift buying goes, I'm popping into local shops at less busy times, maintaining social distancing, wearing a face mask and ensuring I've packed my hand sanitiser.""
Thinking about plans beforehand can be helpful, he says. ""The risk of viral transmission is reduced when meeting people outside, therefore my gift exchanges this year with friends will be completed outside over a glass of mulled wine or hot chocolate, rather than in my home.""
Ahead of the big day itself, testing is still incredibly important, adds Gardner. ""Leading up to Christmas Day, all members of my family will be taking a rapid lateral flow test before meeting, since these give an extra layer of security alongside following all of the other advice.
""For our Christmas Day meal, we plan to eat in the largest room in the house to maximise ventilation. The kitchen extractor fan will be whizzing away all day and the windows will be open to improve ventilation and reduce the risk of virus transmission. If anyone in the family feels unwell with symptoms of Covid-19 - anything from a high temperature or new cough to loss of taste or smell - then they will take a PCR test and isolate appropriately until their test results are back. As we enjoy the festive period, it's really important that we all follow NHS and public health advice this year to keep ourselves, our loved ones and our communities safe.""
                     Take up vaccine boosters  We know that the vaccine is our best defence against the virus, reducing our chances of spreading and catching it, and - if we become infected - it means we are less likely to become seriously ill as a result. It's vital to stay on top of booster vaccinations, hence the UK-wide drive, so be sure to prioritise getting one when you are invited to or when your age group becomes eligible. If you haven't had your primary dose yet, do so as soon as you can (you can book by calling your GP or visiting the NHS website  ).
Now is a good time to start thinking about other jabs and boosters as well. More people are expected to get flu this winter as fewer people will have built up natural immunity as a result of social distancing measures during the pandemic. Research  shows that anybody who gets flu and Covid-19 at the same time is more likely to become seriously ill, so it's really important to protect yourself and those around you by having any vaccinations offered. Even if you have already had Covid-19, the flu vaccine is still safe and effective at helping to prevent flu.
                     Keep indoor areas well-ventilated  Because the Covid-19 virus is passed on via droplets and aerosols when an infected person coughs, talks or breathes, meeting outdoors dramatically reduces the risk of airborne transmission. Sometimes though, this isn't always possible, so when in close contact with others indoors, it's important to let fresh air in whenever you can.
Research  shows that the more fresh air we let into our homes or enclosed spaces, the less likely a person is to inhale infectious particles, so by ventilating indoor spaces we are able to dramatically reduce the chances of transmission. Even just opening windows for 10 minutes makes a real difference. Extractor fans in the bathroom or kitchen are another helpful way of letting fresh air in (just leave them running for longer than usual, with the door closed).
Catherine Noakes, professor of environmental engineering at Leeds University, says: ""While we are all looking forward to spending time with friends and family this Christmas, it's important to remember that coronavirus is still spreading and can easily transmit in the home, even when people are vaccinated.""
She explains: ""In an enclosed space, the infectious particles hang around in the air like smoke and can build up over time, increasing the risk of other people in the room breathing in the virus, especially if there is no ventilation or fresh air helping to refresh the air. That's why it's so important to ventilate indoor spaces by opening windows, even if just regularly for a short time. This way, fresh air can disperse and blow Covid-19 particles away to decrease the risk of others being infected.""
                     Wear a face covering in crowded and enclosed areas  New government rules mean face coverings are now mandatory in some indoor public venues, including places of worship, theatres and cinemas, as well as in communal areas of universities, colleges and schools (by staff, visitors and pupils in year 7 or above) and on public transport.
Ensuring we protect ourselves and those around us is key, so make sure your mask or face covering fits properly - they should cover the nose and mouth completely while allowing you to breathe comfortably. Evidence suggests thicker fabrics and multiple layers may reduce the risk of transmission, so ideally they will be made from at least two layers of material in order to work effectively (the World Health Organization recommends three layers).
Getting in the habit of wearing them in situations where we might be at a higher risk of catching or transmitting the virus is incredibly important - even if it's not legally required. It's especially important to remain vigilant in crowded or enclosed spaces, since it's not always obvious if somebody is infected.
                     Remain vigilant about testing  When life is busy, it's easy to forget to take a test, or to check others in the household are doing so regularly. But ensuring we take regular rapid tests will deliver peace of mind when meeting loved ones over the holidays, as well as helping to stop the spread of the virus. Ahead of meeting anybody indoors or visiting those who are at a higher risk of becoming seriously ill if infected, be sure to take a rapid lateral flow test. Use existing supplies - many schools and workplaces offer free tests, as well as some pharmacies, local community test sites or the NHS website  - it's worth thinking ahead when it comes to the holidays, when we're likely to be socialising much more.
Don't forget the NHS Covid-19 app is still the fastest way to know if you've been exposed to someone who tested positive for Covid-19, so keep it on.
If results are positive, ensure you self-isolate immediately and take a PCR test, as well as reporting the test results (at gov.uk/report-covid19-result  or by calling 119). This is important, since it helps the NHS monitor the spread of the virus and ultimately, saves lives.
For those travelling this Christmas, new rules now mean anybody aged 12 or over travelling to England from abroad must show a negative PCR or rapid lateral flow test result beforehand, having taken the test in the two days ahead of travel. You must also take a PCR test within two days of arriving, self-isolating until the negative test result has been delivered (even if fully vaccinated).
                     Daily testing for contacts of Covid-19                     From Tuesday, 14 December 2021, if you have been in contact with someone with Covid-19 and are double-vaccinated you should take a daily rapid lateral flow test for seven days if you have no symptoms. This will help slow the spread of the virus and allow you and your loved ones to continue your plans that day if you test negative. This applies to those who have been contact traced officially and those who have found out in any other way. All those who test positive within the seven days or develop symptoms must self-isolate, take a PCR test and follow the latest guidance on gov.uk. 
Remember, if you develop Covid-19 symptoms at any time, you must self-isolate and take a PCR test. If you are unvaccinated, you must continue to self-isolate for 10 days if you are a contact of someone with Covid-19. Those working in a vulnerable setting already have access to daily contact testing and should continue to follow the specific guidance from their workplace as this varies depending on the setting.

2021-12-17,How to stay safe from Covid-19 this Christmas: from mask-wearing to booster vaccines,ALL TOGETHER; Version:1,"A conservative radio host from Tennessee who was critical of vaccination efforts and mask mandates died on Saturday, after weeks in a Nashville hospital battling Covid-19.
Phil Valentine's death was reported by his station, SuperTalk 99.7 WTN, on Saturday afternoon.
""We are saddened to report that our host and friend Phil Valentine has passed away,"" the station said in a tweet.  ""Please keep the Valentine family in your thoughts and prayers.""
According to WKRN , an ABC-affiliated Tennessee news outlet: ""Several of Valentine's co-workers and close friends announced they had spoken with Valentine's brother Mark, who confirmed the 61 year old had passed away earlier in the afternoon.""
The station said  hosts would discuss Valentine's ""life and legacy"" on air.
Before contracting Covid-19, Valentine's comments on the pandemic included performing a song  called Vaxman, to the tune of Taxman, George Harrison's Beatles number against government taxation.
""Let me tell you how it will be,"" he sang, ""and I don't care if you agree, 'Cause I'm the Vaxman, yeah I'm the Vaxman. If you don't like me coming round, be thankful I don't hold you down.""
He announced  his diagnosis on Facebook in July. Speaking about his experience of Covid-19, he described coughing, congestion and fatigue which he said ""hurts like crap"". He advised listeners to get vaccinated, but also said  there were some ""very effective alternatives"" to immunisation.
Cases of Covid-19 are surging in the US, fueled by the infectious Delta variant. Hospitalisations and deaths are overwhelmingly of non-vaccinated people.
News of Valentine's hospitalisation in July prompted worldwide news interest.  His family said then: ""Phil would like for his listeners to know that while he has never been an 'anti-vaxxer' he regrets not being more vehemently 'pro-vaccine'.""
That statement asked listeners to pray for Valentine and concluded: ""PLEASE GO GET VACCINATED!""","COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); DEATH & DYING (92%); DEATH NOTICES & OBITUARIES (91%); VACCINES (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (90%); ANTI-VACCINE MOVEMENT (78%); CONSERVATISM (78%); CONSERVATIVE MEDIA (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); FACE MASK MANDATES (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (78%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (73%); TAXES & TAXATION (69%)

2021-08-21,Tennessee radio host who criticised vaccine efforts dies of Covid-19,US NEWS; Version:1,"Facebook has lifted a ban on posts claiming Covid-19 was man-made, following a resurgence of interest in the ""lab leak"" theory of the disease's onset.
The social network says its new policy comes ""in light of ongoing investigations into the origin"".
In February, Facebook explicitly banned the claim, as part of a broad policy update aimed at ""removing more false claims about Covid-19 and vaccines"". In a public statement at the time, it said: ""Following consultations with leading health organizations, including the World Health Organization (WHO), we are expanding the list of false claims we will remove to include additional debunked claims about the coronavirus and vaccines.""
Anyone posting claims that Covid-19 was ""man-made or manufactured"" could have seen their posts removed or restricted, and repeatedly sharing the allegation could have led to a ban from the site entirely.
On Wednesday, the company said: ""In light of ongoing investigations into the origin of Covid-19 and in consultation with public health experts, we will no longer remove the claim that Covid-19 is man-made from our apps. We're continuing to work with health experts to keep pace with the evolving nature of the pandemic and regularly update our policies as new facts and trends emerge.""
The change follows a Wall Street Journal report  that US intelligence sources believe there is some evidence to warrant further investigation of the ""lab leak"" theory. According to the newspaper, three staff members at the Wuhan Institute for Virology sought hospital treatment for flu-like symptoms in November 2019. Others have criticised the reporting , noting that it still relies on circumstantial evidence and speculation.
Facebook is keen to ensure that a change in one rule doesn't lead to a free-for-all for Covid misinformation. On the same day that it lifted the ban on lab-leak theories, it tightened up restrictions on users who ""repeatedly share misinformation on Facebook"".
Under the new rules, individual Facebook users who repeatedly share content that has been rated false will have all their posts suppressed, even ones that have not been - or have yet to be - rated false. Additionally, users who like a page that has repeatedly shared false information will now be given a pop-up notice, warning them of the posting history.
""Whether it's false or misleading content about Covid-19 and vaccines, climate change, elections or other topics, we're making sure fewer people see misinformation on our apps,"" Facebook said in a statement.
The company has come under fire this year for its failure to act on misinformation ""superspreaders""  : individual users with hundreds of thousands, or millions, of followers who regularly post false claims about Covid-19.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (90%); SOCIAL NETWORKING (90%); VIRUSES (90%); FALSE STATEMENTS (89%); HEALTH MISINFORMATION (89%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (89%); VACCINES (89%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); NEGATIVE NEWS (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); VIROLOGY (78%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (75%); TRENDS (74%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (72%); MICROBIOLOGY (71%)

2021-05-27,Facebook lifts ban on posts claiming Covid-19 was man-made,TECHNOLOGY; Version:2,"Covid-19 antibodies have been detected in 67% of the population of India, according to a new survey, indicating how widely the virus spread through communities during the second wave.
India's fourth national sero-survey, which examines the prevalence of Covid-19 antibodies either through infection or vaccination, found that 67.6% of the population of more than 1.3 billion has coronavirus antibodies.
The survey also demonstrated the slow pace of India's vaccination programme. Of those surveyed, 62.2% had not been vaccinated, 24.8% had taken one dose and 13% were fully vaccinated.
The survey result marks a significant rise from the last such survey which was conducted in December and January and found that just 24% of the population had antibodies. This recent survey was carried out in the final weeks of June and beginning of July, just as the second wave had abated, interviewing almost 29,000 people across India.
""The findings clearly show that there is a ray of hope but there is no room for complacency,"" said Balram Bhargava, director general of the Indian Council for Medical Research.
Bhargava warned that the survey showed 400 million Indians still did not have antibodies, and so were vulnerable to the third wave that experts are predicting will hit India within the next few months. In states such as Kerala and Assam, there has already been a severe spike in cases in recent days.
The high prevalence of antibodies was mainly attributed to the virulent second wave which struck India in April. The virus spread like wildfire through both urban and rural areas, overwhelming hospitals and leading to a widespread shortage of oxygen. The government has been widely condemned by opposition politicians this week for claiming there was not a single death in India due to a lack of oxygen, despite hundreds of reports  to the contrary.
Prior to the second wave hitting India, the government was accused of creating a ""culture of complacency"" by loosening Covid restrictions and allowing mass religious and recreational gatherings where the virus was able to spread, fuelled by the highly transmissible Delta variant which emerged in India.
India's official death toll from Covid-19 is more than 400,000 but that is believed to be a huge undercount, particularly when taking into consideration the results of the latest serosurvey. A new report released  by the Centre for Global Development this week concluded that excess deaths in India during the pandemic could be as high as 4.7 million, 10 times the official toll.
In the latest sero-survey, the age group with the highest prevalence was the 45-60 bracket, where over 77% had Covid-19 antibodies, while 66% of those between 18 and 44 were found to have antibodies.","COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); POLLS & SURVEYS (94%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); POPULATION SIZE (90%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (90%); VACCINES (90%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); DEATH RATES (78%); DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (78%); VIRUSES (78%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (73%); RESEARCH REPORTS (73%); MEDICAL RESEARCH (72%); RURAL COMMUNITIES (72%); DEATH & DYING (70%); NEGATIVE NEWS (70%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (66%); ELECTIONS & POLITICS (62%)

2021-07-21,Covid-19 antibodies detected in 67% of India 's population,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"A weaker than expected recovery from the coronavirus pandemic has left the UK as the only G7 country with a smaller economy than in early 2020, according to official figures likely to further undermine the government's tax-cutting measures. 
Before the prime minister and chancellor's meeting with the head of the government's independent forecaster  on Friday morning, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) released figures showing that rather than the economy being 0.6% larger than in February 2020, a combination of a deeper recession during the pandemic and a weak recovery had left it 0.2% smaller.
A better than expected performance in the second quarter of this year, overturning a previous estimate of a 0.1% fall to a 0.2% increase and reversing an assessment that the UK was in recession by June, was not enough to boost GDP growth sufficiently to recover from the first lockdowns in 2020 that brought large parts of the economy to a standstill.
Analysts said Richard Hughes, the head of the Treasury's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility, would be forced by the new figures to take a tough stance on assessing the impact of further borrowing on the public finances.
All the other major economies in the G7, including France and Italy, recovered strongly enough to be larger than they were in February 2020.
“Despite the better news on the performance of the economy in the second quarter, the overall picture is that the economy is in worse shape than we previously thought,” Paul Dales, an economist at Capital Economics, said.
“And that's before the full drag from the surge in inflation and leap in borrowing costs have been felt.”
The Bank of England said earlier this month that it understood the UK economy was already in recession after it forecast a fall in GDP of 0.1% in the third quarter, leading to two consecutive quarters of negative growth, but the ONS estimate of growth in the second quarter shows that while the economy is depressed, it is unlikely to enter a recession until the end of the year.
Separate data showed house prices failed to rise  month on month for the first time since July 2021, a latest sign of the slowdown in the market caused by the cost of living squeeze and rising interest rates.
Kwasi Kwarteng published an economic plan on Friday last week that he said would spur growth by cutting taxes.
However, investors responded to the mini-budget by selling the pound and offloading British government bonds, increasing the interest bill paid by the Treasury.
Samuel Tombs, the chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, said the figures suggested that the damage inflicted by Covid-19 and Brexit on to the economy's ability to grow was even larger than previously thought.
“These revisions will compel the OBR to revise down further its estimates for future potential GDP,” he said.
The recent turmoil in British financial markets has also highlighted the UK's large current account deficit. The amount by which the value of imports exceeds that of exports has worsened since the financial crisis of 2008 and the Brexit vote despite steep falls in the value of the pound that make exports cheaper.
ONS data showed the current account gap in the April-June period shrank to £33.8bn, or 5.5% from a £43.9bn deficit in the first quarter, which was revised down from an earlier estimate.

2022-09-30,UK is only G7 country with smaller economy than before Covid-19,BUSINESS; Version:2,"Whenever a new Covid-19 outbreak occurs in Australia, we hear a lot about daily case numbers and hotspots, but we rarely hear about those diagnosed with the virus and what happens to them.
In Australia, there are more than 450 active cases and nearly 40,000 since the start of the pandemic. The figure is small compared with other countries and a tiny proportion of the hundreds of thousands of close contacts who were potentially exposed.
But what happens if you are among the few to have been at an exposure site , develop symptoms, get tested and find out you are positive? If your symptoms are not severe, can you ride the illness out at home? What if you live alone and can't go out to buy food? And how long do you have to wait before you can safely go back into the community?
                   Do you have to go to hospital?                   
There are national guidelines for treating Covid cases , and these guidelines have been updated several times throughout the course of the pandemic. However, states do differ in their approach to patients.
Queensland does not allow home isolation, even for mild cases, and even for people who live alone. If someone tests positive they are transferred by ambulance to a Covid-19 ward at one of five hospitals across the state; Cairns hospital, Sunshine Coast University hospital, Gold Coast hospital, Royal Brisbane Women's hospital or the Prince Charles hospital.
Exceptions are made for children who test positive. In those cases, their parent or carer will receive a call from the local public health unit who will tell them what to do next. The child will need to stay at home in self-isolation until they recover. If they get sicker, they may be admitted to hospital.
Like Queensland, Western Australia does not allow home isolation with Covid and people must stay in a quarantine hotel.
NSW Health, on the other hand, interviews and assesses people who test positive to decide where a person is best managed - at home, or in hospital. Those who test positive are monitored on a regular basis by a member of the public health unit, even if they are at home.
There is also Special Health Accommodation, known as medi-hotels in other states, which are used for those who become ill in hotel quarantine. These facilities are also used to accommodate members of the community who can't isolate from others at their home, or who are vulnerable and need extra support.
In Victoria, a Department of Health spokeswoman said care is ideally provided in the home through telehealth, though serious cases go to hospital.
The national guidelines say symptoms should be used to help state health departments decide whether a Covid-positive person is best managed in hospital, at home or other settings such as a medi-hotel.
Cases should only be managed at home if they live in a low-risk setting, and consideration is given to whether vulnerable people live in the home as well. If the state or territory health department can be confident that the infected person can be kept separate from other people in the home - for example they have their own bedroom, bathroom and means of getting food without using a communal kitchen - then a positive case may be able to isolate at home.
The case and their household contacts will then be counselled about risk, and infection control measures. Department of Health staff also have to be confident that everyone in the household will comply with directions.
                   What support is offered?                   
In each state, those who test positive are monitored on a regular basis by public health staff who call or text to check in, and are provided with healthcare, which includes mental health support. This is facilitated by the state's public health unit.
States and territories also offer support for those who live alone, or who are struggling to make ends meet due to being unable to work because of isolating due to Covid-19.
For example, in Victoria  people who need to quarantine or isolate and don't have enough food to feed themselves or their families may be eligible to receive an emergency relief package of basic supplies. Support can be accessed by calling the Covid-19 information line in each state or territory.
""After a person receives a positive test result, they will receive a call from a local health service that will provide information about the Covid-19 positive care pathways program, which aims to give all people with Covid-19 access to high quality care and support at the right time and in the right setting,"" a Victorian department of health spokeswoman said.
There is no approved treatment for mild cases of Covid-19 and, in most cases, symptoms will resolve on their own. If you need access to medicines for other medical conditions while isolating with and recovering from Covid-19, you can still arrange telehealth appointments with your GP and many pharmacies can assist  you to have prescriptions delivered to your home.
                   When can I leave isolation?                   
Revisions to the release from isolation criteria have been made due to the significant increase in the number of people in Australia infected with variants of concern, including the Delta variant. 
There are a number of conditions in which someone might be released by the local public health unit, including;
                                                               If at least 14 days have passed since the first positive test for Covid-19 was taken and no symptoms have developed during this period.                                                                 If at least 14 days have passed since the onset of symptoms, and there has been resolution of fever and substantial improvement of respiratory symptoms over the previous 72 hours.                                                                 If there are still symptoms, but at least 20 days have passed since the onset of those symptoms, and the person is not significantly immunocompromised.                                                           
There are slightly higher criteria immunocompromised people have to meet before being released, including returning at least two consecutive negative Covid-19 tests 24 hours apart a week after the onset of symptoms, as well as meeting the criteria in the first two bullet points.
A spokeswoman for Victoria's health department said: ""As the individual reaches the end of the isolation period, the department of health will check if the person has experienced any symptoms in the past 72 hours. If so, their isolation period will be extended. If not, the individual will be cleared from isolation.""
A NSW Health spokeswoman said a person can return to daily activities after they leave self-isolation but should continue to practice good hygiene and physical distancing.
""If they develop Covid-19 symptoms at any point after their isolation period, they should get tested immediately and self-isolate until they receive a negative result,"" the spokeswoman said.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); PUBLIC HEALTH (91%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); VACCINES (90%); VIRUSES (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (89%); ISOLATION & QUARANTINE (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); TELEMEDICINE (77%); FOOD SAFETY REGULATION (74%); TELEHEALTH (68%)

2021-07-06,What happens if you're diagnosed with Covid-19 in Australia?,AUSTRALIA NEWS; Version:2,"The National Hockey League will not send its players to compete in the men's ice hockey tournament at the Beijing Olympics due to Covid-19 concerns as the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the coronavirus spreads globally, ESPN reported on Tuesday.
The NHL agreed last September to pause its regular season so the world's top players could compete in Beijing with the caveat it could withdraw if Covid-19 disruptions forced games to be rescheduled during the Olympics window.
That had begun looking increasingly likely in recent days with the NHL being forced to postpone 50 games in Canada and the United States after a growing number of players entered Covid-19 protocols while Omicron tore through professional sports leagues with fully vaccinated players testing positive.
The NHL did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ESPN said a formal announcement on opting out of the Beijing Games was expected within the next 24 hours.
The NHL had until 10 January to withdraw from the Beijing Olympics, scheduled for 4-20 February, without financial penalty.
Players had mostly been eager to return to the largest international stage. But concerns that a positive test in China could lead to a 21-day quarantine and delay returning to their families and NHL clubs had dampened that enthusiasm for some.
""Obviously, it's unsettling if that were to be the case when you go over there,"" Edmonton Oilers star Connor McDavid, who was expected to be a top player for Canada, said last week.
NHL commissioner Gary Bettman said in early December that the decision on participating in Beijing would ultimately come down to the players, but added that the league's concerns had ""only been magnified"" by the Covd-19 outbreak.
The NHL, unhappy over the prospect of interrupting a regular season to send their most valuable assets overseas where they could get hurt, ended a run of participation in five consecutive Winter Olympics when it decided not to go to Pyeongchang in 2018.
The presence of NHL players at the Olympics made the men's ice hockey tournament one of the marquee events of the global sporting showcase.
Their absence will have an impact on the Canadian and US teams the most, given their entire Olympic hockey rosters would be made up of NHL players. Other medal contenders like Sweden, Finland, Russia and the Czech Republic are somewhat less dependent on NHL talent.
The Washington Capitals-Philadelphia Flyers game scheduled for Tuesday night became 50th NHL game delayed this season for coronavirus-related reasons.
The league said Covid-19 issues with the Capitals prompted the postponement. Defenseman Justin Schultz and forward Daniel Sprong began the team's morning skate in Philadelphia but were pulled off after their test results came back.
Wiping out Capitals-Flyers left the Tampa Bay Lightning at the Vegas Golden Knights as the only game left in the NHL this week. The league and players' association agreed to begin the annual holiday break early and push off the games that were scheduled for Thursday.
""It's not fun to see all these games getting canceled,"" Lightning defenseman Victor Hedman said. ""It'll be interesting to see the make-up dates and when they're going to fit those games in, but for us to focus on that, we can't do that.""","COVID CORONAVIRUS (96%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (96%); SPORTS & RECREATION (93%); WINTER SPORTS (92%); OLYMPICS (91%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (91%); WINTER OLYMPICS (91%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (90%); ICE HOCKEY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); MEN'S SPORTS (90%); PROFESSIONAL SPORTS (90%); SUMMER OLYMPICS (90%); TOURNAMENTS (89%); SPORTS COMMISSIONERS (79%); CORONAVIRUSES (77%); VIRUSES (77%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (73%); ISOLATION & QUARANTINE (73%); VACCINES (73%); FINES & PENALTIES (52%)

2021-12-21,NHL will not send players to Beijing Winter Olympics due to Covid-19,SPORT; Version:1,"The US has declared its support for a patent waiver on Covid-19 vaccines  to boost their production and distribution around the world.
The waiver will not take place immediately as it has to be approved by consensus at the World Trade Organization (WTO), but the decision of the Biden administration to throw its weight behind a waiver will have a strong influence on the outcome of that decision.
""This is a global health crisis,"" Katherine Tai, the US trade representative, said in a written statement. ""The extraordinary circumstances of the Covid-19 pandemic call for extraordinary measures.
""The administration strongly believes in intellectual property protections, but in service of ending this pandemic, supports the waiver of those protections for Covid-19 vaccines. We will actively participate in text-based negotiations at the WTO needed to make that happen.""
The announcement was quickly welcomed by the head of the World Health Organization, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, who described it as a ""monumental moment in the fight against Covid-19"" and a ""powerful example of American leadership to address global health challenges"".
""Now let's all move together swiftly, in solidarity, building on the ingenuity and commitment of scientists who produced life-saving Covid-19 vaccines,"" he said.
The decision was announced during a two-day WTO meeting. India and South Africa have been backing a waiver proposal since October, with the support of about 100 emerging economies, but wealthy countries have been blocking a debate on the issue at the WTO's Trade-Related Aspects of Intellectual Property Rights (Trips) council.
There is still resistance to a patent waiver in the European Union and Switzerland. A meeting of G7 foreign ministers in London  failed to agree on a common position on the issue. A G7 action plan called for greater funding for a UN-administered distribution scheme, Covax, and for voluntary licensing and technology transfer agreements.
Opponents of the waiver within the administration had argued it was not the main bottleneck on production and distribution and that its approval could have a chilling effect on incentives for pharmaceutical companies to produce rapid vaccines in the future. Proponents argued it was an essential move towards greater equity in vaccine distribution and a test of US leadership under Joe Biden's leadership.
At present, one in four people in rich countries have received at least one vaccine dose. In low-income nations, the ratio is about one in 500 people. ""Adoption of this waiver is critical to disseminate vaccine technology to middle-income and low-income nations, so that all people around the world can get access to vaccines and treatment, as quickly as possible,"" Paul O'Brien, the executive director of Amnesty International USA, said.
""By reversing the prior administration's position, President Biden has made clear that the US prioritises people's lives over pharmaceutical company profits.""","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); VACCINES (92%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (91%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (91%); APPROVALS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INTERNATIONAL TRADE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (89%); PATENTS (89%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (85%); AGREEMENTS (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (78%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (78%); INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW (78%); TECHNOLOGY TRANSFER (78%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (78%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (78%); VIRUSES (78%); EMERGING MARKETS (76%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (76%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (75%); TALKS & MEETINGS (75%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (73%); TRADE DEVELOPMENT (73%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (72%); EXECUTIVES (71%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (71%); EUROPEAN UNION (62%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (62%); MIDDLE INCOME PERSONS (60%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (50%)

2021-05-05,US declares support for patent waiver on Covid-19 vaccines,WORLD NEWS; Version:3,"As Covid-19 infections surge in England people are increasingly reporting catching SARS-CoV-2 for a second or even third time. New analysis has suggested that unvaccinated individuals should expect to be reinfected with Covid-19 every 16 months, on average.
With winter approaching, scientists are warning that such reinfections could add to the burden on the NHS, some calling for the vaccination programme to be extended to all schoolchildren, including two doses for teenagers.
""If you've got high-level prevalence, and frequent exposure to the virus, as you have in schools, you are going to see more and more people getting reinfected despite having been double vaccinated,"" said Stephen Griffin, associate professor of virology at the University of Leeds.
This time last year the assumption was that although reinfections could occur this was relatively uncommon , with only two dozen or so recorded worldwide. We now know that natural immunity to SARS-CoV-2 begins to dwindle over time. One Danish study  suggested that the under-65s had about 80% protection for at least six months, while the over-65s had only 47% protection.
The arrival of the Delta variant has further complicated the situation. ""Certainly in the healthcare workers that we've been studying there are many people who had moderately decent levels of antibodies who have been, in some cases, previously infected and double-dose vaccinated, who have gone down with symptomatic infections. I think it is far more common than the kinds of numbers we were used to before,"" said Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College London.
According to ONS data  published on 6 October among 20,262 Britons who tested positive for Covid-19 between July 2020 and September 2021, there were 296 reinfections - defined as a new positive test 120 days or more after an initial first positive test - with an average (median) time of 203 days between positive tests. 
However, the reinfection risk appears to have been higher since May 2021 when Delta took over as the predominant variant.
Further data from the US, where various states have now started tracking and reporting on reinfection rates, supports the idea there is a substantially higher risk of re-infection with Delta. 
In Oklahoma , which has a population of about 3.9 million, there were 5,229 reinfections reported during September (equivalent to a reinfection rate of 1,152 per 100,000) and reinfections have risen 350% since May. The US Centres for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines reinfection as a lab-confirmed case of Covid-19 occurring 90 days or more after a previously lab-confirmed case.
Dr Nisreen Alwan, associate professor in public health, at the University of Southampton, said: ""With rising levels of SARS-CoV-2 infections in the UK, many of us are personally aware of children and adults who got reinfected, sometimes after a relatively short period from their first infection. We still don't know much about the risk factors for reinfection but the theoretical assumption that once all the young get it the pandemic will be over is becoming increasingly unlikely.""
To help answer this question, Prof Jeffrey Townsend, at Yale University School of Medicine, in New Haven, in the US, and colleagues, analysed known reinfection and immunological data from other coronaviruses, including those that cause SARS, MERS and common colds. By combining this with antibody and other immunological data from people who had recovered from SARS-CoV-2, they were able to model the risk of Covid-19 reinfection over time.
The research, published in The Lancet Microbe , suggested that reinfections would become increasingly common as immunity waned, particularly when the number of infections was high. ""If we had no infection controls, no one was masking or social distancing, there were no vaccines, we should expect reinfection on a three-month to five-year timescale - meaning that the average person should expect to get Covid every three months to five years,"" Townsend said.
Although vaccines are suppressing the level of infections, the UK reported 49,156 Covid cases on Monday, the highest figure since mid-July. Rates are highest among secondary schoolchildren, with an estimated 8.1% of this group thought to have had Covid-19 in the week ending 9 October.
""If you allow it to run amok in any age group then it runs amok in all age groups,"" said Townsend. ""The major implications are that if you haven't been vaccinated, you should get vaccinated, and if you've been infected, you should go ahead and get vaccinated anyway, because that will extend the duration of your protection.""
Griffin said: ""If you don't clamp down on prevalence [in schoolchildren] you'll get the spread of infection and possibly reinfection, which will then potentially spread to parents whose vaccines may be waning, and more critically to grandparents and clinically vulnerable people.""","COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (96%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (95%); VACCINES (92%); CORONAVIRUSES (91%); CHILDREN (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); VIRUSES (90%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH (89%); SARS (89%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (88%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (78%); IMMUNOLOGY (78%); MICROBIOLOGY (78%); PREVENTION & WELLNESS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); VIROLOGY (78%)

2021-10-19,Without Covid-19 jab 'reinfection may occur every 16 months' say scientists,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"How did Covid-19 begin? Some propose a ""lab-leak"" hypothesis, according to which Chinese virologists working on ways to make bat coronaviruses more dangerous to humans did all too well at that and then let it escape. Others think it more likely that, like many other diseases, Covid-19 is naturally ""zoonotic"". What?
                     Zoon is the ancient Greek for ""animal"", hence ""zoologist"" and, um, ""zoo"". Nosos, meanwhile, is the Greek for ""disease"", hence many artful English coinages that have long since, alas, fallen into desuetude, such as ""nosography"" (17th century), the systematic description of illness (literally ""writing about disease""), or ""nosotrophous"", disease-causing. A disease that is ""zoonotic"", then, is one that has jumped the species barrier from another animal to flourish in humans, such as bird flu and swine flu, but also HIV (from chimpanzees), toxoplasmosis (cats), anthrax (cattle) and rabies (dogs). 
The technical medical lexicon, happily, still includes the term ""nosology"" (from 1721, defined then by lexicographer Nathan Bailey as ""a Treatise concerning Diseases""): it now means either the systematic classification of maladies, or the state of knowledge about one particular disease. Thus, the question of whether Covid-19 is zoonotic must await further nosological developments.

2021-06-18,'Zoonotic': the Covid-19 origins theory that is not that batty,BOOKS; Version:1,"A new Covid-19 vaccine is being developed by Texas scientists using a decades-old conventional method that will make the production and distribution cheaper and more accessible for countries most affected by the pandemic and where new variants are likely to originate due to low inoculation rates.
The team, led by Drs Peter Hotez and Maria Bottazzi from the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development at Baylor College of Medicine, has been developing vaccine prototypes for Sars and Mers since 2011, which they reconstructed to create the new Covid vaccine, dubbed Corbevax, or ""the world's Covid-19 vaccine"".
Although more than 60  other vaccines are in development using the same technology, Bottazzi said their vaccine is unique because they do not intend to patent it, allowing anyone with the capacity to reproduce it.
""Pretty much anybody that can make hepatitis B vaccines or has the capacity to produce microbial-based protein like bacteria or yeast, can replicate what we do,"" Bottazzi said.
Patent wars over mRNA vaccines have recently heated up. Moderna and the National Institutes of Health are in a dispute over who should get credit for specific discoveries that led to a Covid-19 vaccine which has been delivered to more than 73 million Americans.  If Moderna is found to have infringed on the federal government's patent, it could be forced to pay more than $1bn. 
At the same time, activists have called for Pfizer and Moderna to share the technology and knowhow for producing their vaccines, including taking the fight to the World Trade Organization.  Low-income countries, which have few vaccine research and production facilities, have vaccinated just one in nine people, according to the World Health Organization.  The US has fully vaccinated 67%  of the population and provided a third vaccine dose to more than one-third.
Corbevax's clinical trial data has yet to be released due to resource constraints, but Texas Children's hospital said the vaccine was over 90% effective against the original Covid-19 strain and over 80% effective against the Delta variant. The vaccine's efficacy against the Omicron variant is currently being tested.
The process to create the vaccine involves the use of yeast - the same method by which hepatitis B vaccines are produced.
The Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson & Johnson vaccines currently authorized in the US use different technologies, or vaccine ""platforms"". Moderna and Pfizer use messenger RNA (mRNA) technology. This platform introduces the immune system to Covid-19 by delivering instructions on how to produce its most recognizable feature, the spike proteins which coat its surface. This helps the immune system recognize and fight the virus later, if a person is exposed. Johnson & Johnson's vaccine introduces immune cells to the spike protein through an otherwise harmless cold virus, a technology called viral vector.
The Corbevax vaccine uses a platform called recombinant protein sub-unit technology, which places an actual piece of Covid-19's spike protein in yeast cells. The yeast cells then copy the vital protein and the protein is introduced to the immune system.  
""We make the protein, directly and synthetically, in the lab using the yeast system,"" Bottazzi explained. ""We ask the yeast to make a protein that looks just like a protein that is made by the virus. Then we immunize the protein and the body then processes this protein and presents it to the immune system. Therefore, you don't ask your body to do any major manipulation of the coding.""
Crucially, storing the Corbevax vaccine only requires standard refrigeration, unlike the Pfizer vaccine, which requires ultra-cold storage in transit.
Biological E, an Indian pharmaceutical company accustomed to producing hepatitis B vaccines with whom Bottazzi's team has a longstanding relationship, has already produced 150m doses of the new Corbevax vaccine and will soon be able to produce 100m doses every month.
After being overlooked by government organizations for funding, Bottazzi said, the developers behind Corbevax relied on philanthropic donations to get them over the finish line. The Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development is an academic and scientific institution in nature, but Bottazzi said developing Corbevax had forced them to stretch their resources in order to gain visibility as a serious candidate for Covid vaccine development.
""We ourselves are learning how to do work that is regulatory-enabling, that enables good quality, good reproduction, good record-keeping ... we mimic as if we were a small biotech or manufacturing entity,"" she said. ""Every technology has pros and cons. Nobody is claiming one is the super-duper, only solution. All the [vaccines] are part of the solution. But when you have a situation of such gravity around the world, you don't pick and choose a solution - you try to use all solutions,"" Bottazzi said.
Bottazzi said the reason she and her team did not patent the vaccine was because of her team's shared philosophy of humanitarianism and to engage in collaboration with the wider scientific community.
""We want to do good in the world. This was the right thing to do and this is what we morally had to do. We didn't even blink. We didn't think, 'how can we take advantage of this?' You see now that if more like us would have been more attuned to how the world is so inequitable and how we could have helped from the beginning so many places around the world without thinking 'what's going to be in it for me?', we could have basically not even seen these variants arise.""
Bottazzi hopes her move will incentivize others to follow suit and make affordable and accessible vaccines for other diseases and viruses, like hookworm.
""We need to break these paradigms that it's only driven by economic impact factors or return of economic investment. We have to look at the return in public health.""","VACCINES (97%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); BACTERIA (89%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (89%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (89%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (89%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (78%); BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); HEPATITIS (78%); HEPATITIS B (78%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (78%); MEDICAL RESEARCH (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); MERS (75%); BIOLOGICS MFG (73%); CLINICAL TRIALS (73%); COMMON COLD (73%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (72%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (67%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (50%)

2020-05-19,Corrections and clarifications Covid-19 vaccine | Pedro Duque,NEWS; Version:1,"Misinformation surrounding the death of 27-year-old Sydney man Aude 'Ady' Alaskar is circulating in Arabic WhatsApp groups, while conspiracy-filled Instagram and Facebook pages are trying to convince their followers the young man did not die of Covid-19.
Authorities confirmed Alaskar was not vaccinated against Covid-19 and contracted the virus from his wife, an aged care worker. The forklift driver from Warwick Farm, in south-west Sydney, died on his 13th day of isolation after deteriorating suddenly.
The New South Wales chief health officer, Dr Kerry Chant, told reporters on Tuesday that he had no underlying conditions.
""He did complain of feeling a little fatigued but the deterioration happened suddenly is my understanding,"" she said.
Since his death, misinformation seeking to minimise Covid-19's role in his death has spread through various social media and messaging apps.
A message being shared through WhatsApp groups claims his family have a history of heart conditions that contributed to his death.
The message, written in Arabic, says he was ""90% healthy"" before collapsing around 4pm and dying of a heart attack.
It is unclear whether the message actually comes from the man's family or is fake, but its contents have been picked up by influencers and meme pages, promoting the idea that the man didn't test positive and did not die of Covid-19.
Maria Zee, an influencer with over 10,000 followers, posted a live video to her Instagram on Wednesday night, making baseless and bizarre claims, including that Alaskar had come back to life and medical staff ""destroyed the paperwork"".
Refusing to mention Covid-19 by name - referring to it only as ""C O so and so"" - she also claimed to have received a note from Alaskar that shares his ""experience"" and wrongly blames his death on pneumonia.
Facebook, which owns WhatsApp, has repeatedly stated that it is taking strong action to prevent misinformation about Covid-19 spreading.
In a statement issued on Thursday, NSW Health said people with Covid-19 can develop myocarditis, inflammation of the heart muscle, and pericarditis, inflammation of the outer lining of the heart.
""Myocarditis and pericarditis can be caused by many conditions including autoimmune conditions, viruses and bacteria, certain cancers and certain medications,"" a spokesperson said.
""People who get sick with Covid-19 can develop myocarditis and pericarditis. There is insufficient evidence available to determine whether people who contract the Delta variant of the virus that causes Covid-19 have a different risk of developing myocarditis and/or pericarditis compared with the original virus or other variants.""
Speaking generally, Prof Peter Collignon, an infectious diseases expert at Australian National University, said recent studies in New York suggested Covid-19 may be associated with some forms of sudden death, though it remained a very rare event.
Much of the commentary on Alaskar's death, and others, appears to be driven by a form of binary thinking: that if someone who died of Covid-19 also had another underlying condition, then the virus must not have been the ultimate cause of death.
""Having a binary view of this is counter-productive,"" Collignon said.
Misinformation about the cause of Alaskar's death and conspiracy theories linking his death to government strategies to boost the vaccine rollout also circulated on Facebook.
A post in an Auburn community Facebook page repeated the misinformation about an underlying heart condition being responsible for Alaskar's death.

The misinformation was further amplified in Facebook comment sections, including on news articles announcing the death.
A man claiming to be Alaskar's cousin wrote there is a ""history"" of heart conditions in the family and denied he died of Covid-19.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); DEATH & DYING (92%); INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (91%); SOCIAL MEDIA (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (89%); CONSPIRACY (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); HEART DISEASE (89%); INFLAMMATORY DISEASES (89%); SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS (89%); HEALTH MISINFORMATION (79%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (76%); VIRUSES (76%); AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS (74%); PNEUMONIA (72%); RESPIRATORY DISORDERS & INJURIES (72%); VACCINES (72%); IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDERS (68%); ART HISTORY (67%); BACTERIA (60%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (60%)

2021-08-05,Misinformation on 27-year-old Sydney man's Covid-19 death spreads on social media,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"A second police officer involved in the G7 security operation has tested positive for Covid-19 and a second hospitality business in St Ives has recorded a case.
The Liberal Democrats in Cornwall expressed concern before the summit that the influx of police, delegates and protesters could increase Covid cases and questioned the wisdom of staging a face-to-face meeting.
The Guardian learned on Saturday that a second police officer drafted in to help from a force outside Devon and Cornwall had tested positive. Five others were asked to isolate as a precaution.
Devon and Cornwall police said: ""As part of our testing regime, we have identified one officer who is currently supporting G7 policing who has tested positive for Covid-19 following a PCR test on 11 June.
""The officer, plus a further five officers who have come into close contact, will be repatriated back to their host force where they will enter into a period of self-isolation as per the advice of Public Health England.""
Police said on Friday that an officer billeted on a cruise ship anchored off Falmouth to provide accommodation for about 1,000 had tested positive, which led to 11 others having to isolate.  The second officer was not staying on the ship.
A pub on the harbour at St Ives has also temporarily stopped serving food and drink after a staff member tested positive. The Lifeboat Inn has kept its rooms open.
St Austell Brewery, which owns the pub, said: ""We can confirm that a member of our team at the Lifeboat Inn has tested positive and a number of our team are self-isolating.
""We have taken the decision to temporarily close our food and drink offering at the site as a result of the reduced staff capacity. Guest rooms remain open and we continue our extensive measures to keep everybody safe, including staff testing, regular cleaning practices, social distancing and face coverings in all public areas.""

2021-06-12,Second G7 summit police officer tests positive for Covid-19,WORLD NEWS; Version:2,"Nearly six months after the first Covid-19 vaccines were approved for emergency use, Guardian analysis shows that the vast majority of the world is yet to see a substantial benefit.
Supply shortages, safety concerns, public apathy and slow rollouts have resulted in most countries still being reliant on onerous lockdowns and other quarantine measures to reduce the severity of their outbreaks.
Clear gaps have opened between the handful of countries where vaccination levels are high, those struggling to ramp up their programmes and the many, mostly poor countries that have received only a trickle of vaccine doses so far.
Mapping changes in death rates since 31 January against vaccination rates in each country gives a snapshot of the state of the race to vaccinate the world against the virus. Here is what it tells us.
                   Data                   
Vaccination rate data is sourced from Our World in Data  and shows the total vaccinations in a particular country for every 100 people. Countries that have not recorded a vaccination rate to date have not been included.
Deaths data is from Johns Hopkins University.  The change in deaths since 31 January is calculated by working out the percentage change in deaths between the two-week period to 31 January and the two-week period to 19 April.
Countries that do not yet have a documented vaccination rate are excluded. Countries with more than a 1,000% increase, and fewer than five deaths in the two weeks to 31 January, were excluded so that low baselines did not distort the international picture.
Lockdown stringency data is from the Oxford Covid-19 government response tracker.  The change is calculated by comparing a country's average stringency score in February to its average stringency score in April. A change of -10 or less was used to identify those countries that have opened up significantly in the last two months.","VACCINES (95%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (91%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); SAFETY (90%); SAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (90%); VIRUSES (90%); APPROVALS (78%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (78%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (78%); DEATH RATES (76%); SHORTAGES (72%)

2021-04-21,How vaccines are affecting Covid-19 outbreaks globally,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"People living in the UK's most deprived areas  are more likely to be infected with Covid-19, but research suggests this relationship is a two-way street: becoming infected also increases people's risk of economic hardship, particularly if they develop long Covid.
""We've shown that Covid has an impact on people's ability to meet their basic household requirements - something that is only going to be exacerbated by the cost of living crisis which is happening at the same time,"" said Adrian Martineau, a professor of respiratory infection and immunity at Queen Mary University of London (QMUL), who supervised the research.
The findings have boosted calls for ministers to do more to support the growing number of working-age adults affected by the condition, which is also known as post-acute Covid syndrome (Pacs).
""Many long-haulers have lost their jobs, and in some instances their partners have Pacs, so two salaries have been lost,"" said Louise Barnes, founder of the Pacs19 support group. ""Whilst many have been able to get PIP [personal independence] payments, some haven't, and are no longer being supported by their employers. They are facing a financial nightmare and need financial support.""
According to the Office for National Statistics, about 1.3 million people , or 2% of the UK population, are living with long Covid. Those between 35 and 69 years of age are at greatest risk, and experts have expressed  concerns about the impact of so many working-age people suffering from long-term symptoms and disability.
To investigate the economic consequences of the illness, Martineau and colleagues analysed data from 16,910 Britons aged 16 years or over who completed monthly questionnaires about their health and household income between May 2020 and October 2021.
The study , which has not yet been peer reviewed, found that testing positive for Covid was associated with a 39% increase in the odds of people reporting inadequate income to meet their basic needs, and a fivefold increase in the number of people reporting long-term term sickness absence from work, compared with those who didn't become infected.
The associations were strongest where catching Covid led to hospitalisation or the development of persistent symptoms, supporting the idea that Covid was the cause of people's financial hardship.
Anne Williamson, a health economist at QMUL's Blizard Institute who led the research, said: ""The vicious cycle of poor health and poverty that we identify should lead policymakers to consider early, decisive interventions to break this downward spiral - including employment advice and other economic support, as well as healthcare follow-up.""
In January, MPs on the all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus called on the government  to recognise Covid-19 as an occupational disease  - a move that could help to standardise support and care for those affected, and improve data collection on the problem across the country. The MPs also urged ministers to set up a compensation scheme for key workers who have suffered financially through loss of work.
Lib Dem MP Layla Moran, who is also chair of the  all-party parliamentary group on coronavirus, said: ""As has been the case throughout this pandemic, the greatest burdens have fallen disproportionately on lower income and frontline workers, and we've heard first hand how the debilitating symptoms of long Covid can impact a person's ability to work.
""The ONS estimates that long Covid is impacting almost 1.3 million people in the UK and yet, the government have their heads firmly in the sand about the impact this will have on our economy and essential services.
""They must urgently increase resources for research into treatment and provide compensation to the frontline workers who have sacrificed their health and wealth protecting this country.""","COVID CORONAVIRUS (95%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); RESEARCH REPORTS (89%); VIRUSES (89%); NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWS (79%); COST OF LIVING (78%); DISABILITY FINANCIAL ASSISTANCE (78%); ECONOMICS (78%); OCCUPATIONAL ILLNESS & INJURY (78%); PERSONAL & FAMILY INCOME (78%); WAGES & SALARIES (78%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (77%); PUBLIC POLICY (77%); NEGATIVE EMPLOYMENT NEWS (75%); NEGATIVE NEWS (75%); ADULTS (74%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (73%); LAYOFFS (73%); RESPIRATORY DISORDERS & INJURIES (73%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (72%); WELFARE BENEFITS (72%); EMPLOYEE ABSENTEEISM (71%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (70%); GOVERNMENT STATISTICS AGENCIES (70%); DISMISSALS (67%); STATISTICS (65%); SICK LEAVE (63%); POLITICAL PARTIES (60%)

2022-03-09,"Having Covid-19 linked to risk of economic hardship, study suggests",SOCIETY; Version:3,"A conservative radio host from Florida who criticised coronavirus vaccination efforts - and called himself ""Mr Anti-Vax"" - before contracting Covid-19 himself has died, his station said on Saturday.
A statement said  : ""It's with great sadness that WNDB and Southern Stone Communications announce the passing of Marc Bernier, who informed and entertained listeners on WNDB for over 30 years. We kindly ask that privacy is given to Marc's family during this time of grief.""
When Bernier was hospitalised with Covid-19, three weeks ago, WNDB operations manager Mark McKinney told local media  : ""If you've listened to his show, you've heard him talk about how anti-vaccine he is on the air.""
In December, Bernier told one guest: ""I'm not taking it ... Are you kidding me? Mr Anti-Vax? Jeepers.""
The Volusia county sheriff, Mike Chitwood, said  the station told him Bernier, 65, died on Saturday night.
""I'm numb,"" Chitwood told the Daytona Beach News-Journal. ""To me, this is a death in the family.""
As the contagious Delta variant spreads, states led by Republicans resistant to public health mandates, Florida among them, are struggling with a surge of hospitalisations and deaths.
The overwhelming majority  of hospitalisations and deaths from Covid-19 in the US are among unvaccinated people.
According to Johns Hopkins University , nearly 637,000 people have died of Covid-19 in the US.
Covid deaths among conservative media figures  who opposed vaccination or other public health mandates continue to attract national and global media attention. 
Among tributes to Bernier, who WNDB said  ""enjoyed a successful 46-year career as a broadcast journalist"", many said that though his show presented a conservative viewpoint, he was always fair to liberals.
""He gives all sides,"" Justin Gates, a listener who became a friend, told the News-Journal. ""He's not going to bully and throw punches or do potshots or do things for ratings.

2021-08-29,Florida radio host who called himself 'Mr Anti-Vax' dies of Covid-19,US NEWS; Version:2,"A patient diagnosed with Covid-19 has died at a New Zealand hospital, the Ministry of Health has confirmed , after being transferred from a managed isolation facility for treatment of a separate, serious health condition last week.
The person, whose death was not yet being included in New Zealand's official Covid-related death toll, was diagnosed with the virus after their admission to North Shore hospital in Auckland.
The ministry said more information on the case would be provided on Monday, pending further investigations.
The Ministry of Health said in a statement: ""The patient was transferred from a managed isolation facility into hospital-level care for the treatment of a serious non-Covid-19 related condition on 5 February.
""This person subsequently returned a positive result for Covid-19 following their admission. This positive result has been reported previously.""
Dr Ashley Bloomfield, the director general of health, said on Saturday: ""On behalf of New Zealanders, I want to recognise this family's loss.""
Two more cases were recorded on Saturday in managed isolation facilities, taking the country's total number of active cases to 45.
Only 25 people have died of Covid-19 in New Zealand , which has been routinely praised for its response to the pandemic.
After closing its borders and enforcing a strict lockdown for five weeks in March, the country was able to lift most restrictions. The few cases of community transmission have been quickly stamped out with more localised lockdowns. 
On Friday, the prime minister, Jacinda Ardern, announced that the first vaccines would begin arriving in New Zealand  one month ahead of schedule and that inoculation of border workers would begin next weekend.
Their household contacts will be prioritised next, followed by healthcare and other essential workers, with vaccination of the wider population expected to begin in the second half of the year.
Ardern has said borders will remain closed  until the nation is ""vaccinated and protected"" - likely for all of 2021.","COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (96%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); DEATH & DYING (92%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); DEATH NOTICES & OBITUARIES (90%); DEATH RATES (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (90%); VACCINES (90%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (89%); VIRUSES (89%); EPIDEMICS (78%); ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES & WORKERS (78%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (78%); LEVELS OF CARE (73%); TERRITORIAL & NATIONAL BORDERS (66%); PRIME MINISTERS (50%)

2021-02-13,Patient diagnosed with Covid-19 dies in New Zealand hospital,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"When Keyontae Johnson collapsed on the basketball court on Saturday , college sports temporarily stood as still as his teammates. He was rushed to the hospital where he is currently in stable but critical condition.  There are many possible causes for Johnson's condition, but in the midst of the Covid-19 pandemic, the fact that the 21-year-old and many of his team tested positive for the virus over the summer didn't go unnoticed. While it may well turn out that Johnson's collapse this weekend had nothing to do with Covid-19, there is growing evidence the virus can have serious effects on athletes, even when it appears they have made a full recovery.
The Covid-19 pandemic has shown how a society's desire to return to “normal” can clash with science. Earlier this year, US college sports' governing body, the NCAA, initially cancelled all winter and spring men's and women's championships, including the March Madness basketball tournaments, due to coronavirus concerns. Most other leagues in North America soon followed suit. Since then, some sports have returned, with the NBA managing to successfully navigate a bubble  to complete its season. The NFL, however, has been less successful  with games postponed or cancelled with increasing frequency as Covid-19 surges across the US. Now, the spotlight is back on NCAA basketball.
When it comes to getting athletes back to sports, team doctors must navigate a world where the parents, players, fans, and institutions want to see sports played while also trying to mitigate the spread of Covid-19 and protect athletes from potential short and long-term side-effects of the virus. The biggest concern regarding athletes' health in relation to Covid has been a condition in which the heart becomes inflamed, known as myocarditis. Studies have shown that patients with Covid-19 can develop myocarditis , and the condition has been implicated in the sudden cardiac death (SCD) of athletes even without coronavirus. Several years ago, myocarditis was found to be the third-most common cause of SCD in young people behind coronary artery abnormalities and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (also referred to as an “enlarged heart” or HCM). Meanwhile, US military data suggests that myocarditis is the leading killer of recruits in basic training. Additionally, there is also a thought that exercise in individuals with myocarditis may result in accelerated replication of the coronavirus virus within the body.
In a particularly concerning study, 26 athletes from Ohio State University with confirmed Covid-19 underwent heart testing. Of those tested, 46% were mildly symptomatic for Covid-19 and the other 54% were asymptomatic. All of their labs and electrocardiograms were normal. Yet, using a much more expensive test known as a Cardiac MRI (CMR), 46% showed heart abnormalities, and 15% met the criteria for myocarditis. 
In a recent paper, the Canadian Cardiovascular Society/Canadian Heart Rhythm Society recommended that athletes who test positive or have had suspected cases of Covid-19 can return to sports gradually after seven days without symptoms of the virus. Their statement emphasized that they did not recommend routine labs, electrocardiograms, or CMR before returning to sports if the athlete had no symptoms. They pointed out that abnormalities on CMR often resolve within a few months. Their statement tried to strike a balance between safeguarding athletes while not alarming them unnecessarily – after all, many people have heart abnormalities but never go on to suffer serious cardiac events. The Canadians cardiologists' advice was similar to recommendations by their European and American counterparts, suggesting cardiac testing is unnecessary if athletes display no symptoms following a Covid-19 infection.
However, within the same issue of a recent  edition of the  British Journal of Sports Medicine,  one US paper suggested considering an ECG for Covid-19 infected athletes while another paper from a UK group maintained no cardiac workup was needed in asymptomatic individuals.
Today, as Keyontae Johnson lies in hospital, we still don't know if his condition is related to Covid-19. Fortunately for many, vaccines are beginning to roll out across several countries. Yet, millions of people have been infected with Covid-19, and many were asymptomatic. There is a temptation to watch young men and women in peak physical shape performing amazing feats of athleticism and assume Covid-19 is not a threat to them; that it is a virus that only preys on the old and infirm. Indeed, when we see athletes test positive and return to the field of play a few weeks later, it is easy to believe Covid-19 is merely an inconvenience to sports stars. But complications from the virus in the young, fit athlete are real. Just as pertinently, the controversy as to who to test and whose life may be saved by testing is unclear.

2020-12-14,"Think Covid-19 can't harm healthy, young athletes? Think again",SPORT; Version:1,"A Sydney gastroenterologist who has been enthusiastically promoting an unapproved Covid-19 treatment, including to Australian politicians and general practitioners, has filed a patent in the US for the same treatment, allowing him to commercialise and profit from it, if approved.
Prof Thomas Borody has been quoted in medical newsletters  and publications , and in news outlets including the Financial Review , the Daily Telegraph  and the Australian , promoting what he describes as a ""triple therapy protocol"" to treat and cure Covid-19.
The protocol involves a combination of the anti-parasitic drug ivermectin, zinc and the antibiotic doxycycline.
In December 2020 Borody filed a patent in the US for therapeutic combinations of drugs, including a combination of ivermectin, an antibiotic and zinc. Patenting a treatment means the owner of the patent is allowed to exclusively manufacture, market and profit from the drug until the patent expires, usually after 20 years.
Borody did not declare in numerous media interviews, or in his appeals to state and federal governments for funding and adoption of the treatment, that he also sought to potentially profit from it. While this is not illegal or in breach of professional regulations, medical and research experts Guardian Australia spoke to expressed concern that it may be unethical and a conflict of interest.
In a statement to the Guardian sent via lawyers, Borody denied any wrongdoing. It and said: ""My client has never hidden the fact that he applied for patents over his -19 treatment. That is a matter of public record for some time now.""
On 23 August 2020, four months before filing the patent, Borody wrote to the Australian health minister, Greg Hunt, requesting funding for the therapy. Hunt responded that Borody should apply for funding through independent processes to study the ivermectin treatment as part of a clinical trial.
When asked if Borody had declared his intentions to patent the therapy, or made them aware once it was filed, a spokesperson for Hunt told Guardian Australia: ""We are not aware of Prof Borody's private interests and to the best of our knowledge have no record of having received any such declaration.""
Borody has been lobbying the federal government for more than a year to support the treatment, both before and after the filing of the patent.
The former Liberal MP and now leader of the United Australia party, Craig Kelly, has promoted Borody and the treatment on Twitter, and in February urged the national Covid evidence taskforce, which sets guidelines for clinicians, to ""please look at the evidence""  for the treatment, citing Borody's work. It is not clear whether Kelly was aware of the patent application at the time.
On Twitter, Kelly has claimed government and pharmaceutical companies refuse to endorse ivermectin as a treatment  because it is not profitable, given that it is a drug that has long existed and is cheap to produce. ""The moment that Big Govt accepts cheap & accessible Ivermectin can be effective & would set us free quickly, it would stop Big Pharma making BIG $$$ Big Pharma JUST playing us for $$$,"" Kelly wrote on Twitter on 11 July.
Kelly told Guardian Australia in a statement: ""I have no problems with people like Prof Borody seeking to protect their intellectual property when they discover a new treatment, as do the big pharmaceutical companies who aggressively protect their intellectual property, even to the extent of denying access to developing countries.
""I first spoke to Professor Borody in May of last year ... And I'm aware that he has invested a substantial sum of his own money to undertake trials and develop the intellectual property.""
                   Lobbying the government                   
In July this year Borody emailed a doctor who was also lobbying the government and attached his triple-drug ""treatment protocol to control Covid-19 in NSW in conjunction with vaccination"". Borody suggested the treatment could ""curb the current outbreak rapidly"".
""This can be rolled out across Australia not just NSW,"" he wrote. He also attached a pre-print scientific paper that he claimed showed the efficacy of the protocol and a ""near 100% cure"" rate in 24 patients.
""Thank you for bringing this to the Minister,"" Borody wrote to the doctor. ""This approach adds a badly needed ANTIVIRAL TREATMENT to the VACCINE .... to stop the outbreak, [and] abolish all lockdowns. A zoom explanation for further details and plans would most likely be of help to a Ministerial assistant.""
This email was then forwarded to the treasurer, Josh Frydenberg. Neither the treatment protocol nor the pre-print paper attached to the email declared that Borody had filed an application for a patent for the treatment in the US , and another one in France.
A study co-authored by Borody calling for urgent trials of multi-drug therapies , published in December 2020, after the patent was filed, also failed to disclose the patent. ""There is nothing to disclose,"" the study says under its ""Conflict of Interest"" heading.
But another study  co-authored by Borody and published in August this year, titled ""Ivermectin: a multifaceted drug of Nobel prize-honoured distinction with indicated efficacy against a new global scourge, COVID-19"", does make clear that Borody is ""a principal in Topelia Therapeutics (Ventura, California), which seeks to commercialize cost-effective treatments for COVID-19, including IVM  [ivermectin]"". A ""competing interest statement"" in another study , a pre-print published in July, entitled ""Effectiveness of Ivermectin-Based Multidrug Therapy in Severe Hypoxic Ambulatory COVID-19 Patients"", also states that Borody and another author have ""patents relevant to the study"".
In August 2020 Borody's Centre For Digestive Diseases issued a press release promoting the  triple treatment, encouraging GPs to prescribe the drugs ""off label"". Off-label prescribing, which is legal, is when a doctor prescribes a drug to treat a condition it is not indicated for by the manufacturer or approved to treat by drug regulators.
The press release again does not refer to any intention by Borody to file a patent for and profit from the same treatment.

The Therapeutic Goods Administration investigated Borody over his centre's advertising of a prescription medicine as part of its promotion of the treatment protocol.
""The TGA investigated Prof Borody and the Centre for Digestive Diseases' alleged advertising of a triple-therapy protocol for treating Covid-19 in mid to late 2020,"" a spokesperson said. ""The advertising compliance investigation was closed following removal of relevant content that promoted the use of the protocol, including a prescription medicine, from the website. Prescription medicines cannot be advertised in Australia unless a permission applies.""
The TGA was forced to change its prescribing rules for ivermectin in September this year due to concerns GPs were prescribing it to patients for the prevention or treatment of Covid-19 despite it not being approved for such use in Australia. There have been reports of poisonings among patients taking higher than recommended doses of the drug in a bid to combat Covid-19.
 After moves by the TGA to restrict ivermectin prescribing, Borody's Centre for Digestive Diseases updated its website to state it could no longer accept referrals for the treatment or prevention  of Covid-19 or prescribe ivermectin for Covid-19.
The National Covid-19 Clinical Evidence Taskforce, the body which makes official recommendations to doctors about how to treat the virus, advises in its clinical treatment guidelines  not to use ivermectin for the treatment of Covid-19 outside randomised trials with appropriate ethical approval.
Prof Tari Turner, the director of evidence and methods at the taskforce, said: ""When claims are made about the effectiveness of treatments, it is vital that any potential conflicts of interest are declared.
""This applies to panel members making guidelines, recommendations, and people designing and conducting research, and also to clinicians advocating treatments.
""These declarations need to be specific enough for others to be able to evaluate the extent to which any conflicts of interest might impact on the statements or claims those people are making.""
There are serious concerns about many studies by other researchers  published to date that claim to show ivermectin is an effective Covid-19 treatment either alone or in combination with other drugs. Many of the studies have been criticised for serious flaws in their design  and recruitment of patients, and have been shown to be unreliable.  There are no strong studies with large numbers of patients published in peer-reviewed medical journals that show ivermectin alone or in combination with other drugs is an effective preventative against or treatment for Covid-19, though these trials are under way. Most studies to date have been too small to be clinically significant, or poorly designed.
Borody told the Guardian in a statement from his lawyer that he holds 162 patents for different treatments and therapies for various diseases. He referred to his previous work in the 1980s developing the first therapy, also a combination therapy, to fight H pylori and cure peptic ulcers. This went on to become the gold standard treatment for peptic ulcers globally.
""As a practising doctor and medical specialist, I have been at the forefront of medical research for more than 40 years focusing primarily on repurposing safe, effective, cheap and approved therapies resulting in FDA [US Food and Drug Administration] and TGA approved triple therapies,"" Borody said in the statement.
""This includes the life-saving triple therapy for peptic ulcers with a track record of having saved millions of lives worldwide and 1,050 lives each year in Australia, as well as more than $10bn in hospitalisation costs.
""That would not have been possible unless the therapy had been patented.""
Assoc Prof Wendy Lipworth, from the University of Sydney's Health Ethics centre, said: ""There's nothing wrong with applying for a patent.
""But declaring that patent, when you are becoming a public figure for promoting a treatment, is the bare minimum of your ethical obligations ...
""As a medical professional, there is an obligation to appraise the evidence subjectively and give advice without bias. I think that's where the tension is.
""There's nothing wrong even with having a conflict of interest. What really is the issue is how it is managed, and the most important issue is not declaring it.""
She added: ""Part of due diligence at the very least should be to have a declaration at the bottom about conflicts of interests to do with that treatment. To not do that is blatantly unethical.""
The benefit of applying for a patent in the US is it is a signatory to the international patent cooperation treaty, which means by applying in the US, applicants can simultaneously seek protection for an invention in a large number of countries.
The patent expert and principal of Stephens Lawyers, Katarina Klaric, said: ""Once a patent is granted, the patent owner has a monopoly in respect of the invention, that is the exclusive commercial rights to exploit the invention the subject of the patent.
""This means that the patent owner can take legal action to stop others from manufacturing, marketing, distributing, selling or otherwise commercially exploiting the invention.""
There are considerable commercial benefits in having a patent because of the monopoly rights granted, she said.
""Monopoly rights enable patent owners to recoup some of the substantial investment made in research and development and clinical trial to get a drug to market.""
                   Conflict of interest questions                   
On Wednesday,  six days after Guardian Australia issued Borody with a series of questions asking about the patent and the extent to which he had declared the apparent conflict of interest, Topelia Australia issued a press release  - months after the patent was filed - announcing it had ""secured exclusive global patent rights to Covid-19 Antiviral Triple Therapy from Prof Thomas Borody"". The treatment, trademarked as Ziverdox, is a combination therapy including zinc, ivermectin and doxycycline.
Through his lawyer, Borody said although Covid-19 treatment patents had been filed under Borody's name, those applications and the patents once granted are owned by Topelia Australia.
""There is no guarantee that Topelia will make any money from its patents such is the nature of the commercialisation and development of new pharmaceutical drugs, as well as the pharmaceutical industry,"" Borody's lawyer said.
An Australian Securities and Investments Commission search shows Borody is both the director and secretary of Topelia Australia. The address listed is the Centre for Digestive Diseases. According to the Topelia Australia press release issued this week, the company is hoping to raise $25m from investors in its bid to gain TGA approval, conduct clinical trials and eventually commercialise the treatment.
The president of the Australian Medical Association, Dr Omar Khorshid, said Borody should declare the relevant patent when promoting his Covid-19 triple therapy. ""Any doctor who is advocating to government or to a regulator for approval of a new treatment would of course have to declare their interest in that,"" he said.
""It is a direct conflict of interest. The extent of your conflict has to be declared, not just that there is one, but you have to declare how big it is. Is it a financial one? Are you being paid? Do you have a commercial relationship, do your family members have one? 
""And I think we have an obligation also to disclose to our individual patients if we have some kind of financial interest in our treatment that we're providing or promoting. That's all part of normal business as usual for the medical profession.""
In a statement to the Guardian sent via lawyers, Borody denied that he had ""done anything wrong or illegal when advocating for the repurposing of existing medicines to treat Covid-19"".
""My client has never hidden the fact that he applied for patents over his Covid-19 treatment. That is a matter of public record for some time now. It is self-evident that if a prolific inventor, such as Dr Borody, is advocating the use of his Covid-19 treatment, then he is likely to have a financial interest in that treatment.
""He is a responsible doctor who holds himself to the highest standards in medical practice and research. He is a strong believer in fairness and equity. He is not afraid to challenge medical orthodoxy based on his evidence-based medical research.
""It is silly to allege that my client has an obligation to disclose his financial interest in his treatment when dealing with the federal health minister, members of parliament and others, [or in media appearances and interviews] when he is approaching them on the basis that: (a) he is a medical specialist who has invented his own Covid-19 treatment based on repurposed existing medicines; and (b) his reputation as a medical inventor speaks for itself ...
""He shared his Covid-19 therapy for free with other Australian general practitioners who requested it. It was not illegal then, and it is not illegal now, for my client to have shared his protocol with Australian general practitioners who wanted it.""","COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); PATENTS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); ETHICS (90%); EXPERIMENTAL THERAPIES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS (90%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (89%); ELECTIONS & POLITICS (78%); GASTROENTEROLOGY (78%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (78%); LOBBYING (78%); NEGATIVE NEWS (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (77%); INTERVIEWS (77%); PROFESSIONAL WORKERS (77%); PUBLIC RECORDS (72%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (67%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (67%)

2021-10-18,Doctor who advocated Covid-19 therapy including ivermectin applied for patent on same unproven treatment,AUSTRALIA NEWS; Version:1,"Up to a quarter of British healthcare workers have expressed hesitancy towards Covid-19 vaccines, the first comprehensive study of NHS and care staff suggests. Conspiracy beliefs, a paucity of black and ethnic minority participants in vaccine trials, or assuming immunity to Covid-19 because of previous infection were some of the key reasons cited.
""Understanding these drivers is important, because without this understanding you can't implement any interventions,"" said Dr Manish Pareek, associate clinical professor in infectious diseases at the University of Leicester who led the study.
Pareek and his colleagues previously identified lower rates of vaccine uptake  among black and south Asian health staff, workers under 30, and those living in more deprived areas. To better understand the reasons for this hesitancy, they recruited 11,584 clinical and non-clinical staff working for the NHS and other health providers, such as dental practices and pharmacies. As well as completing detailed questionnaires about their attitudes to Covid-19 vaccination, some of the participants were interviewed more extensively to better understand their concerns.
The research,  which has not yet been peer reviewed, found that 23% of health staff, were hesitant about Covid-19 vaccines, and that hesitancy was more common among BAME health workers, particularly those from black Caribbean groups. However, some white healthcare workers were also hesitant, particularly those in white other ethnic groups. Younger staff, pregnant women and those who had not taken up the flu vaccine were also more hesitant - as were those who had previously tested positive for Covid-19.
""A lot of healthcare workers became infected over the last 12 months, and many will feel that they've already got immunity,"" Pareek said.
Other leading reasons for hesitancy included concerns about how safe the vaccine was due to the speed of development and - particularly for black African and Caribbean health workers - the lack of ethnic diversity in vaccine studies. Experiences of discrimination and structural inequalities also contributed to hesitancy among these groups.
Addressing this misinformation and mistrust could play an important role in helping to tackle hesitancy among healthcare workers, said Dr Katherine Woolf, associate professor in medical education at University College London, who co-authored the report: ""We urgently need strategies to build trust and dispel myths surrounding the Covid-19 vaccine, particularly within communities where there are greater levels of hesitancy. Public health communications should be inclusive, non-stigmatising and use trusted networks.""","VACCINES (96%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); ETHNIC GROUPS (90%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); RACE & ETHNICITY (90%); MINORITY GROUPS (89%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); CONSPIRACY THEORY (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); DISCRIMINATION (78%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); DIVERSITY & INCLUSION (78%); INFLUENZA (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); VIRUSES (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (77%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (75%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (75%); WOMEN'S HEALTH (73%); DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS (72%); PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS (71%); DENTISTRY (68%); MEDICAL EDUCATION (50%); PREGNANCY & CHILDBIRTH (50%)

2021-04-29,Nearly a quarter of British health workers wary of Covid-19 vaccine,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"Families bereaved by Covid insisted Boris Johnson must still face justice at the public inquiry into the pandemic as they voiced concern that his resignation would see him make a fortune from writing and speeches while they remained scarred by grief.
Johnson's departure was greeted by relief by people who lost loved ones to the virus over the last two and half years, but the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice group, which represents more than 4,000 affected families, said: “Johnson will always be the man that wanted to 'let the bodies pile high'  while our loved ones desperately fought for their lives and that partied whilst we had to say goodbye to our loved ones over a screen.”
The prime minister was responsible for a delayed start to the statutory public inquiry  into the UK's handling of the pandemic, which was only formally opened last week despite his earlier pledge in parliament to start in spring 2022.
“The Covid inquiry has only just been given the go ahead – two and a half years late,” said Lindsay Jackson, who lost her mother Sylvia Jackson to Covid on 17 April 2020. “I want to see people held to account – including Johnson – for the callous disregard he showed to my mum and the other souls who lost their lives.”
“This is a man who has presided over the deaths of 200,000 people , broken the laws he made, lied repeatedly to us, trashed our international reputation and has brought politics and politicians into disrepute,” she said. “There's very little more that he could have done wrong. But he's just losing his job. He'll lick his wounds, blame everyone else and then make his millions. That's not justice.”
Leshie Chandrapala, who lost her father Ranjith Chandrapala, a London bus driver who worked without PPE, in May 2020, said she was disappointed that Johnson's handling of the pandemic was not among the reasons for his departure.
“We need Boris Johnson to go immediately so that the business of serious government can resume, including the public inquiry into the pandemic,” she said. “He absolutely must not be allowed to stay until autumn as a caretaker PM.”
She added: “He got so many things wrong during the pandemic, so I absolutely want to see him held to account at the public inquiry. I am putting my faith in Baroness Hallett and her team to uncover the truth of Boris Johnson's actions.”
The inquiry has started gathering evidence and is expected to be divided into several strands, many of which will examine decision-making in Downing Street. Hearings are not expected to begin until 2023. In recent days Johnson allies have repeated his assertion that he “got the big calls right” on the pandemic, often citing the successful vaccination programme.
But Lobby Akinnola, who lost his father Olufemi , a care worker, in April 2020, said: “While Johnson will move on to a life of writing newspaper columns and being paid eyewatering amounts to give after dinner speeches, there will be no moving on for the families like mine that have been ripped apart by his actions. Although his reign will shortly be coming to an end, his devastating impact on families like mine will not.
“We can only hope that the Covid inquiry will bring some closure for us, teaching us the lessons that will save lives in the future and meaning that no one will be able to repeat Johnson's terrible mistakes and get away with it.”","COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); FAMILY (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH (89%); GRIEF (78%); RESIGNATIONS (78%); ELECTIONS & POLITICS (74%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (74%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (74%); PRIME MINISTERS (74%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (73%); VACCINES (73%)

2022-07-07,Covid-19 bereaved say inquiry must hold Boris Johnson to account,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"Exscientia, an Oxford-based firm  that uses artificial intelligence to develop medicines, has won a $1.5m grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation to create a Covid-19 treatment that also works for new mutations or other Sars viruses.
The company, a spin-off from the University of Dundee, is based at the Oxford Science Park. It counts Japan's SoftBank, the fund manager BlackRock, and the US drug firm Bristol Myers Squibb among its financial backers.
Exscientia aims to develop a drug within 12 months, then recruit volunteers for clinical trials.
The company has used its AI technology to design a new class of inhibitors targeting the main protease enzyme of Sars-CoV-2, which is essential for replication of coronavirus. The firm will work on turning these small molecule inhibitors into a pill to treat Covid-19. It hopes the therapy will also be effective against new mutations and other coronaviruses.
Denise Barrault, a biologist and senior portfolio manager at Exscientia who set up the new project and will manage it, said the firm was aiming for a low-cost pill that could be distributed globally and given quickly to people who fall ill with Covid to ward off serious illness and hospitalisation.
She said: ""People who get Covid really need to be treated immediately. They would be administered with the pill and the disease would be far less severe and people would avoid having to go to hospital ... We can't vaccinate everybody and vaccines will lose their effectiveness - only the richest countries will be able to keep up.""
Up to 15 biologists, chemists and AI specialists will work on the project. 
""The danger of new emerging strains and mutations of coronavirus means there is an urgent need for new antiviral drugs in this pandemic alongside vaccines, to respond more quickly in potential future coronavirus pandemics,"" said Barrault.
Exscientia, using its AI technology, has worked with the German firm Evotec on a cancer immunotherapy  for adults with advanced solid tumours. It is now being tested on people. It took just eight months to develop the treatment, while a separate drug for obsessive-compulsive (OCD) disorder, developed in partnership with Japan's Sumitomo Dainippon Pharma, took 12 months.
This testing stage of drug development typically takes four to five years but artificial intelligence can speed it up considerably. The OCD drug and another neuroscience drug, for Alzheimer's disease psychosis, are both in human clinical trials.
Exscientia has also screened thousands of existing drugs  for their effectiveness as a Covid-19 treatment. However, as some were given as an infusion there were problems in setting up infusion centres and none have been adopted as Covid treatments.
The new grant is provided by the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator , an initiative by the Gates Foundation, Wellcome and Mastercard aimed at speeding up the response to the coronavirus pandemic.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (95%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); VIRUSES (93%); CORONAVIRUSES (92%); ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (90%); GRANTS & GIFTS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); SARS (90%); VACCINES (90%); BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY (89%); CLINICAL TRIALS (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); DRUG FAST TRACKING (89%); EPIDEMICS (89%); FOUNDATIONS (89%); CANCER DRUGS (78%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); DEMERGERS & SPINOFFS (78%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (78%); DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); CANCER (77%); ENZYMES (77%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (77%); TUMORS (77%); BIOLOGY (76%); CHEMISTRY (76%); MUTUAL FUNDS (76%); NEUROSCIENCE (76%); ALZHEIMER'S DISEASE (72%); VOLUNTEERS (70%); HUMAN SUBJECTS (56%)

2021-07-08,Oxford drugs firm gains $1.5m Gates grant for Covid-19 therapy,BUSINESS; Version:1,"The Westminster Kennel Club's annual dog show has become the latest event to be postponed or canceled in New York as the number of coronavirus cases surges.
The club's board of governors announced Wednesday it was postponing its 2022 event, scheduled for late January, to later in the year. A new date wasn't given.
""The health and safety of all participants in the Westminster Kennel Club Dog Show are paramount,"" the group said in a statement. ""We appreciate the community's continued interest and support as we delay the show to a time when we can safely convene.""
The 144-year-old dog show attracts thousands of competitors from around the US and is normally held in February, with semi-final and final rounds at Madison Square Garden. Last year, it was moved to June and held outdoors at the Lyndhurst estate in suburban Tarrytown, north of New York City. Spectators weren't allowed, and human participants had to be vaccinated or newly tested.
A Pekingese named Wasabi won best in show, beating out a whippet, a French bulldog, an old English sheepdog, a German shorthaired pointer, a Samoyed and a West Highland white terrier.
With Covid-19 cases now exploding around the US, the postponement comes less than two weeks after more than 8,500 canines, owners and handlers converged for another top US dog show, the American Kennel Club National Championship in Orlando, Florida.","DOGS (97%); DOG SHOWS (92%); VIRUSES (91%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); TRENDS & EVENTS (90%); SAFETY (89%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (79%); BOARDS OF DIRECTORS (78%); TOURNAMENTS (78%); VACCINES (73%)

2021-12-29,Westminster Kennel Club postpones dog show amid Covid-19 surge,SPORT; Version:1,"In early October, Harvard researchers sounded an alarm  : they released a report showing a pattern of coronavirus deaths surging soon after workers filed requests for workplace safety assistance from the US labor department. The takeaway was clear: workers are desperately begging the government to help protect them from a deadly pandemic, the government has been unresponsive, and lots of workers have subsequently died preventable deaths.
Today, a little more than a month after the study came out, the federal government is finally responding: a bipartisan group  of Senate and House lawmakers have announced legislation to shield corporations from lawsuits when their lax safety standards kill more workers.
In practice, the legislation, which is being tucked into a larger Covid relief package, is a holiday-season gift for corporate donors: it would strip frontline workers of their last remaining legal tool to protect themselves in the workplace – at the same time the unemployment system is designed to financially punish those workers  if they refuse to return to unsafe workplaces during the pandemic.
The legislation comes not only as workers continue to die, but also as roughly 7- 9%  of the total Covid-19 death count are “take home” infections traced to employees unwittingly spreading the disease to their families and friends.
At the behest of corporate lobbyists, the liability shield initiative has spread like a virus  in America's political system: as the Daily Poster  first reported, it coursed through state legislatures across the country after the New York Democratic governor, Andrew Cuomo , responded to a Covid-19 mass death in nursing homes by shielding nursing home executives from lawsuits – after a healthcare lobby group funneled $1m into his political machine.
Senate Republicans in Washington then copied Cuomo's liability shield legislation  and pasted it word-for-word into their last Covid-19 stimulus proposal in July.
Unable to pass that federal liability shield legislation on its own, lawmakers from both parties have now come together in a grand show of post-election bipartisan unity to help their corporate donors create a hostage situation that's something out of a dystopian sci-fi movie: their proposal predicates long-overdue and desperately needed unemployment assistance on the condition that corporations are given a get-out-of-jail free card when their profit-maximizing business practices extinguish the lives of employees.
Support from Democratic lawmakers for the liability shield legislation comes after the same healthcare lobby group that drafted New York's law has poured more than $11m  into House and Senate Democratic Super Pacs.
The party, though, doesn't seem to want its own voters to know the details of the deal it is cutting with the Republican party: in a comically on-the-nose attempt at a bait-and-switch, the Democratic senator Joe Manchin touted  the legislation as only financial aid for communities – leaving out the fact that it includes a liability shield for corporations.
US Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez has been one of the few Democratic lawmakers to spotlight what's really going on. Last week, she tweeted  : “If you want to know why Covid-19 relief is tied up in Congress, one key reason is that Republicans are demanding legal immunity for corporations so they can expose their workers to Covid without repercussions.”
The bipartisan initiative aims to obscure its Dr Evil level of depravity by superficially depicting the liability shield as merely temporary. But that seems like a ruse, as indicated by private equity mogul and senator Mitt Romney of Utah, who said  the federal Covid-19 liability shield provision “provides a temporary suspension of any liability-related lawsuits, state or federal level associated with Covid-19, giving states enough time to put in place their own protections”.
Though full legislative language has not been released, the goal seems clear: to give state legislatures more time to permanently prevent workers from suing employers who endanger them, and to permanently block their families from mounting such lawsuits when the workers die.
Notably, lawmakers announcing the proposal did not point to a spate of frivolous wrongful death lawsuits that corporations have been warning about as a rationale for the liability shield. Instead, as the watchdog group Taxpayers for Common Sense recently noted, “of more than 4,100 Covid-19 related lawsuits filed , only 75 are for wrongful death or injury as a result of getting sick at work. Two-thirds fall into three categories – insurance disputes, prison cases and civil rights cases, including challenging shelter-in-place orders.”
Liability shields, laundered as a necessary Covid-19 salve, are really designed to permanently remove the last remaining deterrent to corporate abuse
The liability shield legislation is not some standalone cause – it should be understood as the culmination of a much larger, long-term campaign to remove countervailing force and give capital supreme power over labor.
Over the last few decades, the government – through legislation and court rulings – has weakened unions , which have used collective bargaining to protect workers rights; limited class action lawsuits  and punitive damages , which are designed to punish corporate misbehavior; and gutted  the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (Osha), which is supposed to enforce the weak workplace safety laws still on the books.
Now come liability shields, laundered as a necessary Covid-19 salve, but which are really designed to permanently remove the last remaining deterrent to corporate abuse.
Large employers already knew that a hobbled Osha would – at most – give them the equivalent of a parking ticket for killing workers.  Indeed, the agency has refused  to even issue formal safety standards during the outbreak – a posture designed to make it harder to hold corporations accountable for any unsafe practices at all. The situation is now so unregulated and so bleak that in one situation, corporate managers were allegedly  betting on the number of Covid-19 deaths that would happen at a meatpacking plant.
With liability shields, those same employers will know that they can get away with all kinds of cost-slashing and corner-cutting that endangers workers and denies  them access to basic protective gear.
In other words, corporations will know they can drive the Covid-19 body count ever higher, and they won't even have to worry about being called into a courtroom to answer for their crimes.

2020-12-05,Tucked into the Covid-19 stimulus package? Protection for corporations,OPINION; Version:1,"Modern humans and Neanderthals could be forgiven for having other issues on their minds when they interbred in the stone age. But according to researchers, those ancient couplings laid a grim foundation for deaths around the world today.
Scientists have claimed that a strand of DNA that triples the risk of developing severe Covid-19 was passed on from Neanderthals to modern humans. The genetic endowment, a legacy from more than 50,000 years ago, has left about 16% of Europeans and half of South Asians today carrying these genes.
The origins of the risk genes came to light when scientists in Sweden and Germany compared the DNA of very sick Covid-19 patients with that from Neanderthals and their mysterious sister group, the Denisovans. The stretch of DNA that makes patients more likely to fall seriously ill closely matched that collected from a Neanderthal in Croatia.
""I almost fell off my chair because the segment of DNA was exactly the same as in the Neanderthal genome,"" Hugo Zeberg, an assistant professor at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm, told the Guardian.
Zeberg and his co-author, Svante Pääbo, director of the Max Planck Institute of Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, suspect the Neanderthal genes have persisted in modern humans because they were once beneficial, perhaps helping to fight off other infections. Only now - when faced with a new infection - has their downside been exposed.
It is unclear how the genes may worsen Covid-19, but one gene plays a role in the immune response and another has been linked to the mechanism the virus uses to invade human cells. ""We are trying to pinpoint which gene is the key player, or if there are several key players, but the honest answer is that we don't know which are critical in Covid-19,"" Zeberg said.
According to the study, published in Nature, the cluster of genes on chromosome three are most commonly found in Bangladesh, where 63% of the population carry at least one copy of the DNA sequence. 
""The genes in this region may well have protected the Neanderthals against some other infectious diseases that are not around today. And now, when we are faced with the novel coronavirus these Neanderthal genes have these tragic consequences,"" Pääbo said.
The researcher, who led the international team that first deciphered the Neanderthal genome in 2010, said his ""rough estimate"" was that about 100,000 ""additional"" people have died so far in the current pandemic due to the genetic contribution from Neanderthals.
Beyond the Covid-19 risk genes, the Neanderthals have bequeathed other genes to modern humans. Some increase sensitivity to pain, while others reduce the risk of miscarriages. ""Some are beneficial and some are detrimental,"" Zeberg said. ""This has been a double-edged sword.""
But Mark Maslin, a professor at UCL and author of the book The Cradle of Humanity, cautioned that the work risked oversimplifying the causes and impact of the pandemic. ""Covid-19 is a complex disease, the severity of which has been linked to age, gender, ethnicity, obesity, health, virus load among other things,"" he said.
""This paper links genes inherited from Neanderthals with a higher risk of Covid-19 hospitalisation and severe complications. But as Covid-19 spreads around the world it is clear that lots of different populations are being severely affected, many of which do not have any Neanderthal genes. 
""We must avoid simplifying the causes and impact of Covid-19, as ultimately a person's response to the disease is about contact and then the body's immunity response, which is influenced by many environmental, health and genetic factors.""","DNA (94%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); GENES & CHROMOSOMES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PREHISTORIC LIFE (90%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (90%); CORONAVIRUSES (89%); RESEARCH REPORTS (89%); VIRUSES (89%); WRITERS (87%); ANTHROPOLOGY & ARCHAEOLOGY (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (78%); WILLS (78%); DEATH & DYING (77%); DNA TESTING (73%); NOVELS & SHORT STORIES (71%)

2020-09-30,"Neanderthal genes increase risk of serious Covid-19, study claims",SCIENCE; Version:1,"Nearly 100 million people are expected to watch Super Bowl LV in Tampa, the first time the big game has been held during a pandemic (the World Series has survived two). But only 22,000 of those viewers, 7,500 of them vaccinated healthcare workers , will be in actual attendance, representing just one-third the capacity of Raymond James Stadium. Social distancing and face-coverings will be enforced. The first few rows will be kept clear as a buffer between the field and the fans. By this stage of the pandemic, everyone should be aware that, at any one time, a portion of the population is composed of asymptomatic carriers who can infect others they come into contact with. As a result, any large gathering has the potential to become a super-spreader event with wide-reaching consequences. Large-scale testing at gatherings such as sporting events is limited by the availability of trained personnel, equipment, money, and the time it takes for the results of the actual test to work.
But an unconventional solution may be in the works.
Recently, the Miami Heat announced they are trying a new tactic to screen fans beyond the now familiar temperature checks and questionnaires. The NBA franchise will employ Covid-19 sniffing dogs.  While the idea may seem far-fetched, there is some basis in science and actual application. Dogs have been employed to sniff out drugs and explosives and even some medical conditions such as cancer.  Additionally, K-9 units have been employed for years to detect explosives at the Super Bowl. Fans have been routinely screened on and off-site before walking into stadiums on game day.
A dog's nose has about 300 million scent receptors, which is 50-60 times as many as the average human. It is thought that the breakdown process in the body that occurs with infections or cancers leads to the release of odor molecules called volatile organic compounds  (VOCs). These VOCs then enter the air where the scent can be picked up by a properly trained dog.
There are currently two studies published looking at whether dogs can detect Covid-19. The first study came out of Germany in July 2020. It was published  in the journal BMC Infect Diseases and was noted to be simply a pilot study. In it, eight dogs were trained to detect Covid-19 in respiratory secretions from hospitalized patients versus non-infected patients. The canines were able to detect 94% of the positive samples. This certainly sounded promising, but some critics argued that the dogs may have simply learned the scent of the positive patients since there were only seven subjects. Others pointed out that the samples were from hospitalized patients and therefore may have had more virus than asymptomatic carriers.
A second study aimed to answer whether dogs could pick up Covid-19 from sweat alone, rather than respiratory secretions. It was published in December 2020  in the journal PloS ONE. In this study, researchers from France and Lebanon collected swabs from underneath the arms of patients with and without Covid-19. The success rate per dog ranged from 76% to 100%. This is notable, as the detection rate of current Covid-19 nasal swab tests also falls in this range (80%-100% depending on timing of symptoms). It also appears that a detection dog may be able to sense Covid-19 in samples that have much less virus material than the more expensive genetic tests being used in hospitals across the world.
Several international airports have also begun to utilize Covid-19 sniffing dogs. In Chile, passengers pass through an airport health checkpoint where they wipe their necks and wrists with gauze pads that are sent to dogs for analysis. In Helsinki, arriving international passengers first collect their luggage and then are asked to collect samples of sweat by wiping their necks. But, with the Super Bowl only a week away, it is unlikely we can get a new squad of dogs trained in time. According to the lowest estimate, a dog can be trained in just a week or two to detect the coronavirus. But other research suggests it takes up to eight weeks for a dog that is already trained in detecting non-Covid scents, or up to six months for a dog that has never been trained for detection.
One question that does come to mind is, if a dog is smelling so many Covid-19 positive samples, can the dog itself become infected? Scientists believe it is rare  for a dog to become infected with the virus and they aren't sure if it can pass the disease onto humans. Overall, it seems that Covid-19 sniffing dogs may be part of an answer when it comes to screening large groups of people passing through a designated area, like a sports arena. More rigorous studies are needed, but we may start to see more sporting events utilizing these canines as supplements to existing protocols. Covid-19 sniffing mascots may very well be coming to a sports team near you. The next time you attend a big sporting event, shortly after you get your ticket scanned and pass through a metal detector, you may also be swabbing your armpit for a dog to sniff.

2021-01-29,Will Covid-19 sniffing dogs allow fans back into sporting events?,SPORT; Version:1,"Ellen DeGeneres has tested positive for Covid-19, the daytime TV talkshow host revealed on Thursday.
“Hi everyone, I want to let you all know that I tested positive for COVID-19,” DeGeneres, 62, wrote in a Notes app screenshot posted to her social media channels. “Fortunately, I'm feeling fine right now.”
pic.twitter.com/8pKdgCXY1z  — Ellen DeGeneres (@TheEllenShow) December 10, 2020
DeGeneres also revealed that she had already notified close contacts and was “following all proper CDC guidelines”.
An insider confirmed to the Hollywood Reporter  that production on her show will now be paused until January.
LA county, where her show films, is continuing to see a rise in cases, with 9,243 on Wednesday, the second highest daily total since the virus first started.
The news comes after a difficult year for the comedian, as she faced charges of turning a blind eye to alleged toxic behavior  by producers on her show. A Buzzfeed News report  from July spoke to 36 anonymous employees who said the fear-based culture behind the scenes at The Ellen DeGeneres Show diverged sharply from the host's “be kind” mantra.
Reports of DeGeneres's alleged mean-spiritedness  and backstage turmoil prompted a taped mea culpa. “If I've ever let someone down, if I've ever hurt their feelings, I am so sorry for that,” DeGeneres said at the time. “If that's ever the case, I've let myself down and I've let myself down as well.”
The award-winning NBC daytime show returned in September after an internal investigation into complaints of bullying, racism and sexual misconduct resulted in the exit of three top producers  from the show.
This week also saw a follow-up report  from Buzzfeed News that claimed advertisers and celebrities had been avoiding any association with the show after recent controversies. Ratings have also declined 37% since the last season.",,307,The Guardian (London)

2020-07-02,Corrections and clarifications Covid-19 projection | François Fillon,NEWS; Version:1,"As Covid case numbers rise in New South Wales and Victoria, people across Australia are being urged to get a vaccine booster dose as soon as they are eligible.
Health professionals have warned of problems caused by an increased demand for booster shots, after the emergence of the Omicron variant and a shortening of the interval between vaccine doses.
Both GPs and pharmacist have spoken of issues with the booster rollout, from running out of vaccine to staff shortages.
So where can you get a booster shot and how soon?
                                        Are you eligible?                                      
The first thing to do is check whether you're eligible by looking at the date of your second dose.
People 18 years and older who had their second dose of any Covid-19 vaccine five months or more ago are eligible to get a booster of either the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, even if they had AstraZeneca as their first vaccine.
People who had AstraZeneca as their first two doses can have it as their third if they so choose.
The only exclusion on booster doses is those who are immunocompromised and have already had a third dose.
                                        Where can I get it?                                      
More than 8,500 GPs, community pharmacies, Aboriginal community controlled health organisations, commonwealth and state government clinics are able to offer either the Moderna or Pfizer boosters.
More than 670,000 booster shots have already been administered in Australia.
The federal health department's website  will let you plug in your postcode and the vaccine type you are after to find the clinics near you. However it has limited information on what availability those clinics have.
Alternatively, click below for clinic locations in your state or territory:
Queensland Victoria New South Wales Western Australia Northern Territory South Australia ACT Tasmania
Many of these places have walk-in appointments, especially pharmacies, so you will not need to book, but it is worth calling ahead in advance to see if they have stock.
Boosters remain free of charge.
                                        Can I book an appointment?                                      
If you prefer to book ahead, or if you're not quite at the five month mark, you can book through those sites.
The best site around for finding Covid-19 vaccine appointments is one developed unofficially by Sydney-based developer Ken Tsang called Covid-19 Near Me.  Using data from what he says is a ""range of sources"", the website points out on maps where you can find Covid-19 vaccines, and whether those places have any stock.
The site will then direct you to the clinic or medical centre's booking page to make your booking.","VACCINES (97%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (78%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (78%); OUTPUT & DEMAND (78%); PHARMACISTS (78%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (77%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (77%); PROFESSIONAL WORKERS (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (73%); INDIGENOUS PEOPLES (72%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (65%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (51%)

2021-12-17,Demand for Covid-19 vaccine boosters is surging in Australia: here's how to get yours,AUSTRALIA NEWS; Version:1,"The vaccine manufacturer Moderna is considering Australia as part of a clinical trial to test its Covid-19 vaccine in children.
In its latest quarterly report filed in the United States to the federal financial regulatory agency, Moderna indicated it would test the safety and efficacy of its Covid vaccine in 6,000 healthy children aged between six months and 12 years.
The pharmaceutical company reported it would enrol participants ""in the US and up to two ex-US countries (eg. Canada and/or Australia)"".
The trial, which is planned to run until mid-2023 , is staggering recruitment across three age groups: first in children aged between six and 12, then children aged between two and six, and finally babies between six months and two years old.
The study will test the Covid vaccine's safety as well as reactogenicity - its tendency to produce common adverse effects, such as fever or a sore arm.
The report to the US Securities and Exchange Commission comes as the Australian government announced on Sunday the Moderna vaccine would become available  in Australia from mid-September.
Greg Hunt, the federal health minister, said Australia's Therapeutic Goods Administration was likely to approve the Moderna vaccine for use in the coming fortnight, with one million doses of the vaccine available in the middle of September.
Sign up to receive an email with the top stories from Guardian Australia every morning
In total, 10 million Moderna vaccine doses are expected to be delivered this year, with an additional 15m booster doses secured for 2022.
The vaccine has been approved for use in many jurisdictions internationally, including the US, the European Union and Singapore.
The Moderna vaccine is likely to be administered as two doses given 28 days apart. Like the Covid jab manufactured by Pfizer, it is an mRNA vaccine  : it uses a segment of genetic code that triggers the production of the coronavirus's spike protein in the body, which immune cells then mount a response against.
In the US, Pfizer has also commenced clinical trials of its Covid-19 vaccine in children aged between six months and 12 years.","VACCINES (97%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); DRUG SAFETY (94%); CHILDREN (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); SAFETY (90%); BIOLOGICS MFG (89%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (89%); APPROVALS (77%); BANKING & FINANCE REGULATION (77%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (77%); CORONAVIRUSES (76%); DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS (73%); GENES & CHROMOSOMES (73%); NEWS BRIEFS (73%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (73%); VIRUSES (73%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (72%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (67%); EUROPEAN UNION (66%)

2021-08-09,Moderna considers including Australian children in Covid-19 vaccine trial,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"It has been touted as a breakthrough treatment by Donald Trump, and there are hopes that blood plasma containing coronavirus antibodies may help British patients during the second wave of Covid-19 as well.
But a study, which is published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ) on Friday, suggests ""convalescent plasma"" has only limited effectiveness and fails to reduce deaths or stop the progression to severe disease.
Plasma is the clear, yellowish liquid part of the blood which carries red and white blood cells and platelets around the body. After an infection, plasma is often packed with antibodies generated by the immune system. As such, it is sometimes harvested from people who have recovered from a disease and transfused into patients who are fighting it. This convalescent plasma therapy was used during the 1918 flu pandemic, as well as during more recent global health emergencies, treating patients with Sars or Ebola.
Various trials around the world are exploring whether convalescent plasma could help reduce deaths and serious complications from Covid-19, with the largest randomised controlled trial taking place in the UK.
Despite the findings of the latest published study, convalescent plasma may yet prove to be effective against Covid-19.
The research involved 464 adults with moderate Covid-19 who were admitted to hospitals in India between April and July. Approximately half received two transfusions of convalescent plasma, 24 hours apart, alongside standard care, while the control group received standard care only.
One month later, 19% of those who received the plasma had progressed to severe disease or had died of any cause, compared with 18% in the control group. Plasma therapy did, however, seem to reduce symptoms, such as shortness of breath and fatigue, after seven days.
A spokesperson for NHS Blood and Transplant, which is collecting plasma from people who have recovered from Covid-19, emphasised that UK-based studies are only infusing plasma that contains high levels of coronavirus antibodies. He said the Indian study used plasma with antibody levels around six to 10 times lower than that.
The Indian researchers agreed that further studies using high antibody levels may find it to be more effective. An interim analysis of 136 Covid-19 patients in a trial at Houston Methodist hospital in Texas suggested a significant reduction in deaths among patients who received plasma with high levels of antibodies early in the course of their disease.
Followup data from all 351 patients in the Texas study has been published as a preprint and supports this conclusion, although plasma transfusion later in the course of the disease had no significant effect on death rates regardless of antibody levels. ""With respect to altering mortality, our analysis identified an optimal window of 44 hours post-hospitalisation for transfusing Covid-19 patients with high titre convalescent plasma,"" they wrote.
Prof Paul Morgan, the director of the Systems Immunity Research Institute at Cardiff University and a member of the British Society for Immunology's expert taskforce on immunology and Covid-19, said there were other reasons for optimism. For one thing, he said, the study suggested plasma therapy was associated with a reduction in viral load, ""so, there does seem to be an antiviral effect of the therapy, even if it isn't reflected in the final outcomes"".
The study also hinted that infusing patients with large amounts of donated plasma could lead to a small but significant increase in deaths. ""It might be worth considering, rather than giving just convalescent plasma, taking the antibodies out of the plasma and using those,"" Morgan said. Such purified antibodies are already used to treat patients with antibody deficiencies.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); CORONAVIRUSES (91%); VIRUSES (91%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); MEDICAL RESEARCH (90%); RESEARCH REPORTS (90%); BLOOD TRANSFUSIONS (89%); DEATH & DYING (89%); DEATH RATES (89%); WRITERS (89%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (78%); EBOLA VIRUS DISEASE (78%); EXPERIMENTATION & RESEARCH (78%); INFLUENZA (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); RESPIRATORY DISORDERS & INJURIES (78%); SARS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (77%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (77%); BLOOD DONATIONS (73%); EPIDEMICS (73%); TROPICAL DISEASES (72%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (60%)

2020-10-23,"Covid-19 blood plasma therapy has limited effect, study finds",WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"Looking at how health services in different countries have responded  to Covid, we can see some common ground. Many countries are increasing funding for health services, expanding the number of frontline clinical staff, providing separate areas to care for patients with confirmed or suspected Covid-19, and using digital technology to deliver virtual rather than face-to-face appointments.
But there are some distinctions: peer a bit closer and it is clear that we have something to teach and something to learn  from every healthcare system. The UK has its achievements to share, from a nationalised (and devolved) system that can pool surgical resources in local areas and support mass trials to test new treatments, to a historically strong primary care model that played a key role in delivering the largest vaccination programme in British history while continuing to deliver daily care to patients.
There is also much we can learn from other nations. Some of the countries affected by Sars, such as Singapore, developed new types of facilities  with more single and isolation rooms, better ventilation, and versatile designs that could be rapidly adapted for surges in demand. The government's new hospital building programme  must ensure that NHS facilities are better suited to cope with future pandemics.
We can also learn from the way in which other countries increase their health and care workforce during surges of demand like pandemics. Even before Covid-19, some states such as France had established permanent reserve  lists of workers who can be rapidly expanded and mobilised to support health services. Other countries that mandate community service often offer placements in hospitals, ambulance services and nursing homes. During Covid-19 the NHS workforce was boosted by a dedicated corps of volunteers, retired clinicians, and clinical students, but exploring other approaches  to rapidly expanding our health and care workforce would be prudent with future pandemics in mind.
Although virtual GP and outpatient appointments ballooned here, other countries with more advanced health-data systems have gone further and faster in using digital technology to support health services. In countries such as Singapore and Denmark, self-driving disinfection robots helped clean clinical environments and ""command centres"" were developed to coordinate health service responses based on real-time data. The NHS worked hard  to collect and use data in a more sophisticated way during Covid-19, but a more sustained commitment to digital technology will be needed to give the UK the modern tools it needs to face future pandemics.
The final international lesson is the simplest: give your health and care system the resources it needs to be resilient. The NHS went into the pandemic with rising waiting lists for care, hospitals full to bursting and fewer doctors, nurses and intensive care beds than comparable  countries. And successive governments have ducked the issue of social care reform while countries like Japan and Germany acted  decades ago to shore up their social care systems. According to the Care Quality Commission, this inaction has left the UK's health care and social care systems facing a "" tsunami of unmet need  "" and hospitals full of stranded patients who could be discharged if they had the support they needed when out of hospital.
Our health and care system was agile enough to create emergency field hospitals, transform general hospital wards into intensive care areas and use available private sector capacity during the pandemic. But it is hard to shake the impression that the NHS was having to press the accelerator harder because it was starting near the back of the queue. The promises of social care funding reform and a new funding deal for the NHS are welcome, but these come with much ground to make up after a decade where funding failed to keep pace with rising demand and a health and care staffing crisis was allowed to develop.
Recently published data  show the UK is still towards the middle of the pack of industrialised nations when it comes to funding our health service, lagging behind countries like France and Germany. Although the government has promised a new funding deal for the NHS, it is unlikely that this will send us to the top of the international leaderboard on health funding. And the new investment - while clearly substantial - is unlikely to be enough  to meet the medium-term pressures on a service that will be fighting fires on multiple fronts, as it continues to battle Covid-19 and tackle the burgeoning waiting lists for care that grew during the pandemic.

2021-11-24,Here's what the UK can learn from other countries' responses to Covid-19,OPINION; Version:1,"When Covid-19 began to spread rapidly in January 2020, governments across the world had limited strategies to deal with it. Without a vaccine or proven treatments for the disease, or even access to mass testing, the only choice political leaders faced was taking the least bad option available.
There were four approaches that different governments took during the beginning of the pandemic. China, New Zealand, Vietnam and Thailand chose to eliminate the virus  at the cost of stopping international travel. Singapore, Hong Kong and South Korea suppressed the virus through rigorous testing, tracing and isolating while avoiding harsh lockdowns. Sweden allowed the virus to spread through the population before realising health systems could not cope with an influx of Covid-19 patients. Meanwhile, European countries including  England and France  controlled the virus through a cycle of lockdown measures while keeping borders largely open. This resembled a holding pattern for a plane running out of fuel: people grew tired of continual restrictions, the economy suffered and Covid-19 was never fully suppressed.
Before the arrival of vaccines, the most effective  of these strategies was the elimination, or ""zero Covid"", approach taken by countries such as New Zealand, Taiwan and China. But the tools we have at our disposal have changed radically in the past 15 months. We now have safe and effective vaccines, treatments and mass testing, which permit governments to rethink their initial strategies and form a more sustainable plan for the future.
Covid-19 forced governments around the world into a tailspin because of the substantial number of deaths it caused, the burden it placed on health services and the risks of long-term symptoms in younger people. Without lockdown measures in place, the virus could grow exponentially, finding endless hosts to jump between, while fear of the virus caused people to change their behaviour, resulting in economic damage. Vaccines are now addressing these three problems. If governments are able to vaccinate 80-90% of their population, Covid-19 will increasingly become a manageable health issue, much like other vaccine-preventable diseases such as measles or pertussis (whooping cough).
We know that vaccines clearly help to reduce hospitalisations and deaths. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  found that elderly people vaccinated with mRNA vaccines (Pfizer and Moderna) were 94% less likely to be hospitalised than people of the same age who were not vaccinated. A study  in Scotland  found that after the fourth week of an initial dose, the Pfizer and AstraZeneca vaccines reduced risk of hospitalisation by up to 85% and 94% respectively. Early research from Yale University  also indicates that vaccines seem to help those with long Covid. As many as 30-40% of those who get the vaccines report improvement to their symptoms.
If vaccines do indeed prevent people from dying or getting seriously ill, then the end of the pandemic is in sight for the countries that have high vaccine coverage, testing and treatments. One recent study  of healthcare workers in Scotland that has not yet been peer reviewed suggests vaccines may also be able to prevent transmission. Israel has raced ahead in its vaccination programme, with the US and the UK not far behind. The European Union is steaming along, and the next group to join them will probably be in east Asia and the Pacific. Once these populations are protected with vaccine-induced immunity, they can start to open up again to the world and lift their border restrictions in a careful and managed way.
In these countries, case numbers will become less relevant, as the link between cases, hospitalisations and deaths will be largely broken. This was always the aim of scientists working on treatments and vaccines, and science has succeeded. But there are still two areas of considerable uncertainty. We may yet see the emergence of a variant that reduces the effectiveness of vaccines against death and serious disease. And how we manage the virus in children and adolescents, who will be largely unvaccinated and still susceptible, will be a continuing challenge. It seems inevitable that children under 16 will also be vaccinated (the US has already authorised the Pfizer vaccine to be used in 12-15s).
So when will the pandemic be over? Covid-19 won't end with a bang or a parade. Throughout history, pandemics have ended when the disease ceases to dominate daily life and retreats into the background like other health challenges. Barring a horrific new variant, rich countries such as Britain and the US may be within months, if not weeks, of what their citizens will see as the end of the pandemic.
This isn't the case in poorer countries in Latin America, sub-Saharan Africa and south Asia. For countries that can't afford vaccines, technology or treatments for Covid-19, populations will remain trapped by outbreaks that cause chaos in hospitals and kill health workers and vulnerable and elderly people. It's now incumbent on richer countries that are emerging from the pandemic to turn their attention to poorer nations and ensure they have the resources they urgently require. It's only when Covid-19 stops disrupting lives and livelihoods in all regions that we'll truly be able to say the pandemic has ended.

2021-05-31,"In rich countries, vaccines are making Covid-19 a manageable health issue",OPINION; Version:2,"NBA players who choose not to be vaccinated against Covid-19 could lose millions of dollars, the league confirmed on Wednesday.
""Any player who elects not to comply with local vaccination mandates will not be paid for games that he misses,"" Mike Bass, the NBA's executive vice president of communications, said in a statement on Wednesday morning.
The NBA does not require its players to be vaccinated, although they are under stricter protocols than those who have had the Covid-19 shot. However, local laws in cities such as New York and San Francisco prohibit the unvaccinated from certain public places, including indoor sports areas. That means unvaccinated players for teams such as the Brooklyn Nets and Golden State Warriors would not be able to participate in home games. 
Around 90% of NBA players are vaccinated, a much higher rate than the overall US population. However, there are questions over certain high-profile players. The Nets' all-star point guard Kyrie Irving was not at the team's media day earlier this week  and when asked about his vaccine status replied: ""I'd love to just keep that private and handle it the right way with my team and go forward together with a plan"". The Warriors' Andrew Wiggins said he also wanted to keep his vaccination status private.
Irving is due to make just under $35m in salary this season , meaning his losses would run into the millions if he sat out every Nets home game. The Nets' cross-city rivals, the New York Knicks, says all their players have been vaccinated.
On Tuesday, Irving's former teammate, LeBron James, said  he had been ""very skeptical"" the vaccine initially before deciding it was ""the right thing to do"".","BASKETBALL (92%); VACCINES (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); MANDATORY COVID VACCINATIONS (90%); MANDATORY VACCINATIONS (90%); PROFESSIONAL SPORTS (90%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (90%); WAGES & SALARIES (90%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (89%); ATHLETES (79%); SPORTS & RECREATION (79%); POPULATION SIZE (78%)

2021-09-29,NBA players who refuse Covid-19 vaccine could lose millions in salary,SPORT; Version:1,"The federal government plans to immediately begin distributing a new monoclonal antibody cocktail from Regeneron, the same drug Donald Trump received when he was hospitalized with Covid-19 in October, officials said in a press call.
The two-drug cocktail with the tongue-twisting generic names casirivimad and imdevimab will be used to treat people who are at high risk of being hospitalized with Covid-19, but still have mild to moderate disease.
“We expect to distribute about 30,000 doses of the Regeneron product tomorrow with more to come in the ensuing weeks,” said the US health and human services secretary Alex Azar.
The federal government's contract with Regeneron currently covers 300,000 doses, which will be distributed to states based on the number of people who test positive and are hospitalized for Covid-19. At such extremely limited quantities, demand will far outstrip supply.
More than 142,000 people were diagnosed with Covid-19 the day before the announcement. More than 12.3 million Americans have now been diagnosed with Covid-19 since the beginning of the pandemic, and more than 257,000 people have died, according to the Johns Hopkins University Coronavirus Resource Center.
The US Food and Drug Administration gave Regeneron emergency permission to distribute its antibody cocktail over the weekend. The emergency use authorization is far short of a formal approval, but will allow doctors another option when treating Covid-19, for which there are still few tailored therapies. However, because of the extremely limited quantities, it will not stop the pandemic on its own.
“Much of the attention, rightfully, has gone to vaccine development,” said Dr Janet Woodcock, director of the FDA's center for drug evaluation and research. “We also have been working to develop a wide range of therapeutics to try to cover the time before we have the vaccine, as well as those individuals who are not protected by a vaccine.”
Officials said they hoped the antibody cocktail would help high-risk individuals, such as people who are older than 65 or obese, before they need to be hospitalized, and are approved in people older than 12. The drugs were designed off the back of another successful therapy for Ebola virus.
While the drug's distribution will give some Americans access to the same drug that Trump received, they will not access it in the same dose. Regeneron's FDA emergency authorization is for a 2.4-gram infusion, where Trump received a higher 8-gram dose.
This may be at least partly because of concerns around manufacturing capacity. Even at full manufacturing Regeneron will only be able to make 2m doses a year.
In October, Regeneron's chief scientific officer, George Yancopoulos, said if he had only one patient, “I'd give the high dose,” but, “from a societal point of view and the need to treat as many people as possible, I'd give the lower dose,” according to Science Magazine. 
In another point of difference from the president's treatment, Americans will still probably shoulder the administrative costs of receiving the intravenous drug, even though the federal government has paid for the pharmaceutical itself.
Under normal circumstances, monoclonal antibodies are among the most expensive drugs on the market. The family of drugs is often used to treat cancer, and the average price over the last 20 years of drug approvals was more than $96,000.  Officials did not immediately respond to questions about the likely cost of those services.
“It's vital Americans be aware of these expanding options,” said Azar later in a press call. “We are now seeing positive news on the therapeutic and vaccine front nearly every day.”
Azar said the news should also be a reminder for Americans to “double down” on “masks, hand-washing and social distancing”, especially ahead of the upcoming Thanksgiving holiday. “There is light at the end of the tunnel,” he said.
While surveys show a majority of Americans have scaled back holiday plans, a meaningful minority appears to be traveling against health officials' advice, raising the potential for “a surge superimposed upon a surge,” according to Dr Anthony Fauci, in a separate appearance on Washington Post Live. 
Because of surging cases, Azar also urged Americans who have recovered from Covid-19 in the last three months to give convalescent plasma, which is used to treat people with active coronavirus infection.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); VACCINES (90%); VIRUSES (90%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (89%); EPIDEMICS (89%); BIOLOGICS MFG (78%); DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY (78%); EBOLA VIRUS DISEASE (78%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (78%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012 (78%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (78%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (78%); SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLE (73%); TROPICAL DISEASES (71%); US FDA REVIEW (71%); MANUFACTURING OUTPUT (68%); EXECUTIVES (63%)

2020-07-29,Corrections and clarifications Covid-19 treatment trial | Austria cases,NEWS; Version:1,"We are writing on behalf of the millions struggling to survive the pandemic far from home. Some have fled wars, conflict, persecution and human-rights violations. Others are moving to escape socioeconomic hardship or climate-change effects.
Far from home, many risk exclusion or neglect, facing barriers to accessing vaccinations, testing, treatment and, sometimes, information.
The poorest countries often shoulder the greatest responsibility for supporting displaced people and others on the move. They need reliable, adequate vaccines and other critical supplies to stabilise fragile health systems, and save their citizens, migrants and refugees, and others.
The vaccine equity gap between wealthier and low-resource countries demonstrates a disregard for the world's poorest and most vulnerable. For every 100 people in high-income countries, 133 doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been administered, while in low-income countries, it is four per 100 people.
Vaccine inequality costs lives, placing everyone at risk. History and science make it clear: coordinated action with equitable access to public health resources is the only way to face down the Covid-19 scourge. We need a strong, collective push to save lives, ensuring a sustainable global recovery.
Vaccines are powerful; they're not the only tool. We need tests to locate the virus, treatments including dexamethasone and medical oxygen to save lives, and tailored measures to prevent transmission.
Leaders of the largest economies have the power and responsibility to help stem the pandemic by expanding access to vaccines and other tools where these are in shortest supply.
This weekend's summit in Rome will call for ""courage and ambition"" to recover from the pandemic and overcome inequality. We collectively call on G20 leaders, to:
                     (1) Increase vaccine supplies for the poorest.  The leading economies must fully fund and implement the Strategic Plan and Budget for the ACT Accelerator, and distribute vaccines, tests and treatments where needed. If we are to recover from the pandemic, we must meet the targets to vaccinate 40% of the world's population by the year's end - and 70% by mid-2022.
                     (2) Ensure access to vaccines for all people on the move.  We call on every country to ensure everyone on its territory, regardless of status (including refugees, migrants, internally displaced people, asylum seekers, others on the move), has access to Covid-19 vaccines, tests and treatment. They should remove barriers to vaccination for all on their territory - for example, the need for specific documents, geographical barriers, the need in some settings to report to immigration authorities, high fees - and fight vaccine misinformation.
                     (3) Support low- and middle-income countries to combat Covid-19 with all available means. These countries need comprehensive support - financial, political, technical, logistical - to vaccinate quickly and effectively, expand access to tests and treatments, implement tailored public health measures, and build resilient systems for future emergencies.

2021-10-29,"For displaced people, Covid-19 has even more dangers. The G20 must help them",WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"As America grapples with record-breaking surges in Covid-19 infections and no meaningful federal response, some state and local governments are implementing new restrictions to combat the surging  virus.
Other hard-hit areas, however, are taking little to no action against a pandemic that has claimed more than 200,000 lives and sent the US economy into a tailspin.
Oregon, which saw a state record-breaking 805 new cases on Thursday and 769 on Friday, will implement new restrictions in at least five counties to stop Covid-19 from spreading. These regulations halt visits to care homes, and limit indoor dining at restaurants to 50 people, according to the Associated Press.
Authorities are also urging businesses to require work-from-home. Officials are also asking Oregon residents not to gather with people they don't live with, but to limit any non-household gathering to six people, the AP reported.
In New York, Andrew Cuomo, the governor, said on Friday that officials were weighing additional restrictions to combat the surge in western and central New York and would announce details on Monday. Cuomo also said that officials would ramp up enforcement of new quarantine requirements for out-of-state travelers.
Those coming to New York from states other than New Jersey, Connecticut, Pennsylvania and Massachusetts must take a Covid-19 test within three days of arriving, show proof that it is negative, and then have another negative test the fourth day after arrival.
""We're going to be increasing enforcement personnel at the New York airports. You should not land if you do not have proof of a negative test upon landing,"" Cuomo said. ""I'm increasing the national guard. I spoke to New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio about increasing the New York police department at the airports, but I want people to know we're serious.""
New Jersey is poised to see new restrictions after Covid-19 hospitalizations tripled over the last seven weeks, governor Phil Murphy said on Thursday. The state's daily case data is also nearing the levels seen in early May. Connecticut has also limited some reopening initiatives due to a recent spike in cases, NBC New York reported.
Elsewhere, the response was not as aggressive despite the virus now raging through vast swaths of America, and especially the midwest and Great Plains states.
On Friday, health authorities in Kansas reported 5,418 new coronavirus cases over two days. A top health authority said that people are ignoring masks and social distancing initiatives indoors and at public events - and claimed many local officials ""haven't done anything"" to stop the spread, AP said.
North Dakota and South Dakota, which do not have full or partial mask requirements, are seeing soaring rates. In Wisconsin, which is also seeing rising case numbers, Governor Tony Evers's health emergency order was made ""virtually irrelevant"" because of legal challenges, the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel reported.
Although Iowa is seeing record Covid-19 infection and hospitalization rates, the Republican governor, Kim Reynolds, has not announced any new actions to stop the disease from spreading. She urged Iowa residents to ""do their part"" and said authorities would launch an awareness campaign promoting hygiene and social distancing, the Des Moines Register reported.
This patchwork approach has boded poorly for countrywide disease rates.
The US broke its record for the highest number of Covid-19 cases in a single day on Friday, with 128,000 additional new infections, according to  the Washington Post. Deaths were over 1,000 for the fourth day in a row. About 53,000 people were hospitalized because of coronavirus on Thursday.
In total, the US has marked more than 9.7m Covid-19 cases and 235,000 deaths since the pandemic started - more than any other country, according to Johns Hopkins University data.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (89%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); FACE MASK MANDATES (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (78%); PUBLIC OFFICIALS (78%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (78%); CITY GOVERNMENT (75%); HOME BASED EMPLOYMENT (73%); VIRUSES (72%); POLICE FORCES (69%); MAYORS (62%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (56%)

2020-11-09,New restrictions announced in US states seeing Covid-19 surges,WORLD NEWS; Version:3,"Justice Brett Kavanaugh has tested positive for Covid-19, the supreme court announced on Friday, just three days before the court is set to begin a new term hearing oral arguments in key cases relating to religion, guns and abortion.
The court said Kavanaugh, 56, is showing no symptoms of the virus and has been fully vaccinated against Covid since January.
As a precaution, Kavanaugh and his wife did not attend a Friday morning event for Justice Amy Coney Barrett, the newest member of the court, to take the oath of office in a so-called investiture ceremony.
The announcement that one of the nine justices on the bench, which is balanced 6-3 in favor of conservatives, has contracted Covid-19 comes days after a slim majority of five justices declined to block restrictive Texas abortion measures.
The decision, which was justified on procedural grounds, prompted fierce condemnation, including from Joe Biden, who has initiated a study of possible reforms to the court.
The announcement of Kavanaugh's positive test also comes as several justices on the bench have responded to criticism that the court's decisions are guided by political leanings.
Liberal Justice Stephen Breyer, 83, argued in a new book that judges on the bench are guided not by politics but judicial philosophy. Similarly, the conservative justice Clarence Thomas has hit back at suggestions that judges go ""right to their personal preference"".
Coney Barrett, the third conservative appointee of Donald Trump after Neil Gorsuch and Kavanaugh, has said that ""the court is not comprised of a bunch of partisan hacks"".",,264,The Guardian (London)
2021-10-01,Brett Kavanaugh tests positive for Covid-19 as court prepares for new term,US NEWS; Version:1,"Robert Durst, the wealthy New York real estate heir and convicted murderer, is on a ventilator after testing positive for Covid-19, his attorney has confirmed  to the Los Angeles Times.
Durst's attorney Dick DeGuerin told the newspaper his client was in ""very bad condition"" during the sentencing hearing and ""was having difficulty breathing and he was having difficulty communicating"".
DeGuerin confirmed to the Times  that Durst had been hospitalized and placed on a ventilator in a wing of USC medical center under the watch of the Los Angeles county sheriff's department where he has been through out his recent murder trial.
The announcement of a Covid-19 infection comes two days after Durst, 78, was sentenced to life imprisonment for the murder of Susan Berman in 2000, a slaying possibly tied to the 1982 disappearance Durst's wife, Kathie McCormack Durst.
Durst appeared frail and at times confused at trial. His lawyers said at Thursday's sentencing they plan to appeal his conviction.
The latest development in the Durst story comes a month after a Los Angeles jury convicted  Durst of first-degree murder in the 2000 killing. At trial, prosecutors argued that Durst had shot Berman at point-blank range in her home to prevent her from telling police what she knew about the disappearance of Durst's wife, whose body has never been found.
Six years ago, a documentary series The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst  brought new public attention to the accusations against Durst. He was arrested on the eve of the airing of the last episode, in which Durst appeared to confess to the killings, saying to himself, ""What the hell did I do? ... Killed them all, of course.""
The Berman case verdict was the first homicide conviction for Durst, who has also been linked to the death of neighbor Morris Black, whose body parts were found In Galveston Bay, Texas. Durst had fled to Texas after Berman's killing and lived under an assumed name, Dorothy Ciner , and regularly wore a woman's wig, dresses and high heels.
Claiming self-defense, Durst was acquitted  of Black's murder in 2001, despite admitting to dismembering his body.","MURDER (99%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (93%); CRIMINAL CONVICTIONS (92%); SENTENCING (92%); LAWYERS (91%); CORRECTIONS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); JAIL SENTENCING (90%); LITIGATION (90%); PRISONS (90%); DEATH & DYING (89%); APPEALS (78%); ARRESTS (78%); HOMICIDE (78%); JURY TRIALS (78%); NEGATIVE NEWS (78%); PUBLIC PROSECUTORS (78%); VERDICTS (78%); ADMISSIONS & CONFESSIONS (75%); SHERIFFS (75%); SELF DEFENSE (73%); ACQUITTAL (69%)

2021-10-16,Convicted murderer Robert Durst on ventilator after testing positive for Covid-19,US NEWS; Version:2,"The Liverpool midfielder Thiago Alcântara has tested positive for Covid-19. The 29-year-old, who missed Monday's 3-1 victory over Arsenal, has exhibited minor symptoms of the virus but is in good health and is getting better, the club said.
""The club has, and will continue to follow, all protocols relating to Covid-19 and Thiago will remain in self-isolation for the required period of time,"" Liverpool added. 
The club's first-team doctor, Dr Jim Moxon, said: ""It is the choice of each individual whether they reveal publicly the outcome of a Covid-19 test. We have followed all the protocols to the letter and Thiago is OK. He will be self-isolating now as per the guidelines and hopefully he'll be back with us soon.""
Thiago joined Liverpool from Bayern Munich for an initial fee of £20m on 18 September and made his debut in the 2-0 victory over Chelsea two days later. He shone as a second-half substitute and there was much excitement among Liverpool fans over the prospect of seeing him make his full debut against Arsenal. That did not occur and self-isolation means the Spaniard will also miss Thursday's game against the same opponents in the Carabao Cup as well as Sunday's league visit to Aston Villa. He should, however, be available for the trip to Everton on 17 October.
""After the international break, he will be fine,"" said Jürgen Klopp after the win against Arsenal. ""For sure and that's the situation at the moment""
Liverpool's other signing during the current transfer window has been Diogo Jota and he not only featured against Arsenal but also scored having come on as a second-half substitute. Speaking afterwards, the Portuguese said: ""When you arrive at a team that are world champions, you always try to adapt as quickly as possible.

2020-09-29,Liverpool's Thiago Alcântara tests positive for Covid-19,FOOTBALL; Version:2,"They will be remembered as India's lost months: the stretch between September and February when Covid-19 cases in the country defied global trends, falling sharply throughout the coldest months of the year until they reached four-figure daily totals.
It was inexplicable. Was it the Indian climate? A protection conferred by childhood immunisations? Some speculated India may have naturally reached herd immunity. It was a tantalising idea that took hold in India's highest circles of policymaking, media and science - even a government-commissioned study suggested herd immunity may indeed have been achieved. It would prove one of the most fatal miscalculations of the Covid-19 pandemic so far.
Now, with daily cases crossing 360,000, and recorded deaths beyond 3,200 per day , many see the lull between Covid-19 waves as a cruel illusion. ""The elections, religious festivals and everything else opened up completely,"" says Sujatha Rao, a former secretary of the Indian ministry of health and family welfare. ""That was a very bad mistake and we have paid a very dear price, a heavy price for that oversight.""
An outbreak the size of India's second wave, apparently fuelled by Covid-19 variants that appear to be more infectious than earlier strains, would have overwhelmed most public health systems - let alone one of the most chronically underfunded in the world , serving a vast, spread-out population.
But public health experts, including some involved in advising the government, say the scale of India's current outbreak was also partly manmade, the result of a feeling of exceptionalism that emanated from the top of the Indian government and rippled across society, leading to countless administrative and personal decisions that, within a few months, would prove disastrous.
""There was a misreading of the situation in January that we had attained herd immunity and were unlikely to see a second wave,"" says K Srinath Reddy, the president of the Public Health Foundation of India. ""India went into full-blown celebratory mode. And we know the virus travels with people, and celebrates with crowds.""
The virus travels with people, and celebrates with crowds
  K Srinath Reddy    
Alongside warnings that people should maintain precautions, governments at all levels relaxed restrictions, allowed massive social events to resume and pressed ahead with raucous electioneering, confident the continued circulation of Covid-19 in states such as Kerala or Maharashtra were the dying embers of the virus, not evidence of the sparks that would ignite a second firestorm.
""There was a lot of mixed messaging coming through which made people very complacent,"" Shahid Jameel, a virologist at Ashoka University, told a forum  there on Tuesday. Some politicians and scientists boasted of low infection and death rates that gave Indians the impression ""that somehow we are special"", Jameel added. ""We are not special.""
                   Supermodels and herd immunity                   
Given India's youthful population, Covid-19 death rates were expected to be smaller than elsewhere. But official numbers during the first wave were exceptionally low. In Karnataka, a state with a similar population to France, seroprevalence studies have suggested nearly half of people  were infected by August. Yet the state's Covid-19 death toll was about 12,000 last year, compared with the more than 60,000 people who died from the virus in France over the same period.
Studies are already beginning to understand the extent to which official Indian records of that time were unreliable. Ramanan Laxminarayan, the founder and director of the Centre for Disease Dynamics, Economics and Policy in Washington DC, told the Ashoka University panel that a forthcoming study of Indian mortality rates suggested the country had not escaped the first wave so unscathed.
""[The study shows] Indians are not exceptional at all,"" he said. ""In fact a lot of our mortality is in that 40-70 age group, where our mortality rates are higher than for other countries.""
The belief that India may have shaken off Covid-19 for good was bolstered by some scientists. Members of a committee established by the government to create a ""supermodel"" of Indian cases published a study  in September claiming their model showed India may have already reached herd immunity. Others made a similar argument in newspaper columns.
""The idea that India had hit herd immunity, that we only needed to be careful and we could eradicate the virus by February, and the implicit assumption that Indians were 'exceptional' in some way - in that most of those infected would be asymptomatic as a result of genetics or prior exposure - all of this was wrong,"" says Gautam Menon, an expert in disease modelling at the Institute of Mathematical Sciences in Chennai.
It was part of a stream of scientific advice flowing to the government, including more critical views warning there were still hundreds of millions of susceptible Indians, and that future strains of the virus could be more aggressive, as they had been in Europe and the US.
""But you must understand in which environment this advice landed,"" Reddy said. ""The Indian economy had gone into a slump before the pandemic. It had challenges during the pandemic, and it was just beginning to show some signs of recovery. There was some sense of urgency by the people in charge of the Indian economy, as well as industry leaders, to put it back on the rails.""
In that context, and with case numbers continuing to drop, ""people heard what they wanted to hear"", says Reddy, who sits on the government's national scientific Covid-19 taskforce.
""The politicians wanted to get back to their business, which is local elections and campaigning, the sportsmen wanted to get back to cricket tournaments,"" he said. ""There was a receptivity to any scenario predicting a full recovery with little possibility of a second wave.""
By late February, with official caseloads dwindling, life in India had been allowed to return to something close to normal. Malls in Delhi and Mumbai were busy. Crowds filed into cricket stadiums, including the largest in the world, named after the Indian prime minister, Narendra Modi.
In spite of warnings in November by an Indian parliamentary committee that the numbers of beds  in government hospitals was ""abysmally small"", four temporary hospitals in the capital were dismantled, according to the Indian Express , along with an 800-bed hospital in Pune and a Covid-19 facility  in Assam state.
""There was this huge window of opportunity to really set ourselves up,"" Rao says. ""The time could have been used on a very focused approach to scale up readiness for wave two. [But] we thought we were over the worst and had managed it.""
For a stretch between 11 January and 15 April, the country's national scientific taskforce on Covid-19, which advised on quarantine policies and testing and treatment protocols, did not hold a single meeting, according a report in the Caravan , confirmed by the Guardian.
                   'God will overcome the fear of the virus'                   
In West Bengal, a state considered a prize for Modi's ruling Bharatiya Janata party (BJP), India's election commission overruled opposition parties and gave permission for the country's longest-ever regional election campaign, along with elections in four other states and territories. Modi himself boasted of the size of the crowds he would address in the weeks to come. By the beginning of this week, West Bengal had the fastest growing Covid-19 outbreak  in India. On Thursday, voting went ahead anyway.
We thought we were over the worst and had managed it
Approval was also given for the Kumbh Mela, a religious festival in a north Indian city on the banks of the River Ganges that would draw millions of Hindu pilgrims. For the BJP, a party that seeks to give primacy to India's Hindu heritage, the go-ahead for the festival was highly symbolic. The event was advertised as clean and safe  on the front page of national newspapers in advertisements that bore Modi's face.
Tirath Singh Rawat, the chief minister of the state where the Mela was being held, encouraged as many as possible to come. ""Nobody will be stopped in the name of Covid-19, as we are sure the faith in God will overcome the fear of the virus,"" he said. Recorded infections in the state have jumped 1,800%  over the past 25 days.
In its public statements, few groups were more certain in their conclusion that the pandemic was over than the ruling BJP. At a meeting of its national executive early in the year, with its eye on the upcoming elections, the party issued nothing less than a victory cry.
In the face of the world ""speculating over how India with its vast population and limited healthcare infrastructure"" would deal with the pandemic, according to a party resolution, it could be ""said with pride that India [had] defeated Covid under the able, sensitive, committed and visionary leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi"".
The resolution was issued on 21 February, a day when 14,199 cases were recorded across India. Two months later, the figure would be 314,644.
The same feeling that the worst was over seemed to influence a lack of urgency in the country's vaccination programme. Despite having almost a year to build vaccine infrastructure to reach Indian adults, the rollout started slowly. The government trumpeted vaccine giveaways to rival China's influence in south Asia, while getting its hands on fewer than a hundredth of the doses required to vaccinate India, counting on securing the rest later as younger groups become eligible for shots.
There had been dissent to this triumphalism among the country's top scientific advisers, according to several sources, but in public they strove to put the best face on the situation. Such an impulse was not unique to the Indian outbreak, but was so distinct there that the Lancet warned in a September editorial  that persistent ""false optimism"" risked undermining the country's response.
""We don't know what they did behind closed doors, but in the weekly Covid briefings of the health ministry, [advisers] came out day after day giving us data about how cases per millions and deaths per million in India were the lowest in the world,"" said Abantika Ghosh, the health editor of the Indian news website the Print.
""But they would give us numbers of testing and vaccinations in absolute numbers, because in a per-million setting, they don't look impressive, they're quite low. Questions were sidestepped. There was this compulsion, it seemed, to look away from science, from evidence the world over and just establish that India is different.""","COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); PUBLIC HEALTH (91%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); NEGATIVE NEWS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (90%); RESEARCH REPORTS (90%); TRENDS (89%); TRENDS & EVENTS (89%); PANDEMICS (78%); DEATH RATES (77%); EPIDEMICS (76%); MICROBIOLOGY (76%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (75%); ELECTIONS (75%); ELECTIONS & POLITICS (75%); FESTIVALS (73%); POLITICS (73%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (73%); VACCINES (73%); VIROLOGY (73%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (67%)

2021-04-29,'We are not special': how triumphalism led India to Covid-19 disaster,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"A Covid-19 disaster is threatening the small southern African kingdom of Lesotho after revelations that the government released people who had tested positive for the virus from quarantine early.
Government sources this week said they had been sending Covid-19 patients home from as far back as last June over cost concerns.
It comes as the country, the last in Africa to record a case of the virus, recorded a sharp rise in cases in recent weeks after high numbers of workers travelled home from South Africa for the Christmas holidays.
According to the latest figures from the National Covid-19 Secretariat (Nacosec), Lesotho had 4,137 cases as of Wednesday, up from 2,137 on 1 December. The country has a population of about 2 million.
Moeketsi Majoro, the prime minister, has responded by imposing an 8pm curfew, closing bars and nightclubs, banning sports and closing schools.
It came as South African immigration officials estimated that, since Monday, more than 100 travellers a day from Lesotho were testing positive at border points.
The department of home affairs said that those who tested positive for the virus were being turned back, except for South African citizens, who were being quarantined.
Of about 130,000 people who have entered Lesotho from South Africa since the beginning of December, just 20% had Covid clearance certificates and only about 39,000 were tested for the virus. Thousands more people are believed to have crossed the border illicitly, unable to afford the 800-rand (£38) Covid-19 test, and seven bodies were recovered from the Mohokare River  in the last week of December. Police say others are still missing.
On Wednesday several minibuses transporting Basotho people without Covid-19 clearance certificates were stopped by the police in South Africa.
A Lesotho government source told the Guardian authorities had stopped quarantining travellers because most of those sent to the facilities were not showing symptoms. He said it was decided that seriously ill patients would be sent to hospital. However, the hospitals are also overwhelmed.
“We did away with quarantine facilities in June because most of the people sent there were not even showing signs, hence it was a strain on our already thin budget. It was decided that only those who were seriously ill would be sent to hospital,” the source said.
Nacosec risk communications manager Baroane Phenethi said new quarantine facilities were now being identified.
“We never anticipated a surge. We are trying to identify quarantine facilities for those who are asymptomatic. Those who are visibly sick would be sent to hospitals,” Phenethi said.
He warned of more deaths in the coming weeks. Lesotho authorities have been overwhelmed because of the huge cross-border traffic with South Africa, where cases have also risen exponentially over the festive period.
“We are anticipating a rise in cases and even deaths. Cases are rising because people crossed [into Lesotho from South Africa] through illegal borders and are only being tested now when they are returning to South Africa. What's worse is that the new Covid-19 variant is more severe than the one we had during the first wave,” Phenethi said.
Last week the government said it would ensure that at least 200 people a day were tested for Covid-19 in each of the country's 10 districts. Motlatsi Maqelepo, the health minister, said this would ensure 2,000 results daily.
However, a tour of the Maseru testing centre at Makoanyane primary school in Ha Leqele this week revealed that fewer than 100 people were being tested each day.
A health worker who wished to remain anonymous said the dire situation was worsening. “The system is overwhelmed and it cannot cope with the huge numbers. Of course, the minister said 2,000 results would be available daily but that is ambitious.
“We have a colleague here at Queen Mamohato Memorial hospital who was tested in December and results were expected on the next day. She got confirmation that she had Covid-19 after the hospital authorities begged the laboratory to speed up the process on 2 January. She died two days later.

2021-01-08,'We can't cope': Lesotho faces Covid-19 disaster after quarantine failures,GLOBAL DEVELOPMENT; Version:1,"Everyone in England  is now able to take a free Covid-19 lateral flow test (LFT) twice a week, but experts have raised concerns about accuracy. We take a look at the issues.
                   What is a lateral flow test?                   
LFTs are a rapid way of testing for Covid-19. A swab is taken from the back of the nose or throat and it provides results a little like a pregnancy tests, with a red line appearing if coronavirus proteins are detected and a second line that indicates the test is working.
These tests differ from polymerase chain reaction (PCR) tests, which look for genetic material from the virus, called RNA (ribonucleic acid) and are more accurate. However, LFTs have the advantages of being cheap and offering results in about 30 minutes, and they can be carried out at home.
                   Where are LFTs used?                   
Until recently the tests were used for mass testing in particular settings, such as schools.  However, earlier this month the government announced that LFTs would be made available for all adults to take a test twice a week.  The idea is that the tests will help pick up cases of Covid that may otherwise go undetected, for example because of few or no symptoms, and help prevent the spread of the virus.
                   How accurate are LFTs?                   
The accuracy of LFTs appears to depend on the make of the test used, whether people have symptoms , and who is conducting the test.
The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said the Innova lateral flow devices detect over 95% of individuals with high viral load, the most infectious cases, most likely to spread the virus further.
However, mass screening in Liverpool found that the devices detected only 67% of highly infectious people who had no symptoms, meaning one in three cases were missed. These tests were also ""assisted"" by experts, which have shown to be more accurate than those used by untrained members of the public.
A Cochrane review  of 64 studies found  that LFTs correctly identify on average 72% of people who are infected with the virus and have symptoms and 78% within the first week of becoming ill. But in people with no symptoms, that drops to 58%.
                   What are the concerns?                   
One concern is that those who receive a negative result from LFTs may still have the virus - experts have previously said this means the tests should be seen as offering a ""red light"" rather than a ""green light"".
The regulator responsible for approving coronavirus tests for use in the UK, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), has expressed concern to government that people may be falsely reassured if they test negative on an LFT.
The MHRA has authorised LFTs to be used as a ""red light"" test - to find infectious people and order them to self-isolate - but not as a ""green light"" test to allow people greater freedoms if they test negative. The regulator is concerned that the government's universal testing programme blurs the lines between the two.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); VIRUSES (90%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); GENETIC ANALYTIC TECHNIQUES (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (78%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (78%); SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS (78%); SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLE (78%); HEALTH CARE LAW (73%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (66%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (66%)

2021-04-25,Covid-19: how accurate are lateral flow tests?,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"Human challenge trials - in which young, healthy volunteers are intentionally infected with a virus to allow vaccines and treatments to be tested quickly - have been used in the fight against diseases ranging from typhoid and cholera to malaria.
With the announcement on Tuesday of such trials to help develop a vaccine against Covid-19 there is a key difference - there are as yet very few proven therapies for the virus and we know little about its long-term effects.
But volunteers are lining up in the UK. A non-profit organisation called 1Day Sooner has attracted over 38,500 willing participants for Covid-19 challenge trials globally, including more than 2,500 in the UK. Volunteers interviewed by the Guardian say they want to participate for altruistic reasons - for the greater good, despite the uncertainty of how contracting Covid-19 could affect them.
""I would be lying if I said there's not like an underlying worry there or fear there because this virus is less than a year old,"" said Chris Holdsworth, 25, who is studying for a PhD at the University of Edinburgh.
""But at the same time I just try to contextualise the risk, without trivialising it,"" he said, highlighting other procedures that pose bigger health risks to the young and fit.
The trial process is straightforward. First, an appropriate dose of the virus is selected. Then vaccinated volunteers are intentionally infected, potentially producing results quicker than conventional vaccine field trials in which researchers must wait for participants to get infected in the real world.
These studies can also be used to compare multiple vaccine candidates, develop treatments and gather data about the immediate aftermath of infection that wouldn't be possible to procure otherwise.
In an open letter urging the UK government to support Covid-19 challenge trials last week, more than 170 scientists and academics highlighted that the mortality risk in healthy (and unhealthy) 20- to 29-year-olds was lower than donating a kidney.
Although mortality risk in the young and healthy is categorically low, other unknowns remain, such a "" long Covid "", where some patients experience symptoms for months after contracting the virus.
""Even if the long-term effects turn out to be even worse than what we suspect, I still think there are many volunteers - including myself - who would be willing to go ahead because the benefit could be possibly saving people's lives,"" said 22-year-old volunteer Seán McPartlin, who is currently getting a master's in philosophy at the University of Oxford.
McPartlin's father is not entirely onboard with his son's intention to partake in challenge trials, even though he appreciates the benefit of conducting such studies.
""People might think going to war is a good idea ... but they don't want the one they love to be the one who takes the risk,"" he said. ""It's perfectly understandable psychologically, but indefensible intellectually, and potentially morally.""
For others, the risk of contracting the virus in the real world is reason enough to volunteer. Estefania Hidalgo Di Miele, 32, is a photography student at the University of the West of England who works the night shift at a petrol station.
""I'd rather focus on what I could be doing than fear what could happen if I get exposed to the virus,"" she said, noting that, given the nature of her job, she is in any case at risk through contact with customers.
Danica Angel Marcos, 22, a 2019 graduate from the University of Lancaster, is also worried about contracting Covid-19, given the rapid hike in cases.
""There's a chance of getting it anyway just trying to buy groceries - so I want to catch it for a reason, for a purpose,"" she said.
But she wonders whether taking the risk will be worth it in the end, given the apparent rise in anti-vaccine sentiment.
""The fact that even if there is a vaccine, there are lots of people saying they wouldn't take it - that concerns me quite a bit,"" she said. ""Especially when I'm wanting to do a challenge trial and wanting to risk myself in order to develop this vaccine.""","COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); VACCINES (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); VOLUNTEERS (91%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); NONPROFIT ORGANIZATIONS (90%); DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY (78%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (78%); TROPICAL DISEASES (78%); MALARIA (73%); ORGAN DONATION (50%)

2020-10-20,The volunteers lining up for Covid-19 challenge trials,WORLD NEWS; Version:2,"It was the second day of school for Greenville elementary school, and students were scattered across the playground, soaking in the late August sun. On the swings, some kicked their way closer to the cloudless sky; others scampered around on the multicolored jungle gym. There were shrieks and snacks and one skinned elbow, and the air was fragrant with the freshly laid woodchips that cushioned the students' rapid descent from the slide.
It's the kind of scene Kristy Warren has witnessed countless times. She first came here as a student herself, then returned about 20 years later as a school principal. Since then, in the course of her seven years as the Plumas county assistant superintendent for curriculum and instruction, she's made regular visits to the stretch of road where this small northern California town's elementary school and junior-senior high school stand side-by-side.
But this day was different. After more than two years of school closures and crises – first the pandemic, then the devastating Dixie fire  – the campus was alive with activity. This year marked the first time since 2019 that Greenville's students would return to these classrooms on schedule as well as in person. Standing on the newly poured blacktop with a few teachers, Warren agreed that it looked like a regular school day – if you ignored the backdrop of fire-blackened trees.
Working as a school administrator in a rural county with fewer than 20,000 people comes with its own unique challenges, and the disasters Warren's district has weathered in recent years have only expanded her role. Warren juggles responsibilities that would probably be shared in a larger or wealthier district, including overseeing the curriculum – from early learning through adult education – for all eight of Plumas county's schools, and dealing with everything from human resources and hiring to technology and budgeting.
After Covid-19 shuttered the schools in March 2020, Warren oversaw getting the district's 125 teachers set up online, first with Zoom and then using a new system she selected. When students finally began to resume in-person learning, she fielded questions and complaints about the mask mandates and helped set up a testing system that screened hundreds of students a day. She was eager to get kids back in the classroom, and she spent the summer of 2021 optimistically preparing for what was supposed to be a more normal fall, now that vaccines were readily available.
But on the evening of 4 August, less than three weeks before the first day of school, the Dixie fire, the second largest wildfire in California's history, swept through Greenville. The nearly 964,000-acre blaze devastated the town and destroyed the majority of its buildings, including Warren's childhood home.
Residents were evacuated, and many found little remaining when they returned. The flames licked the corner of the high school gym, destroyed the elementary school's wooden welcome sign, and melted the playground equipment – but the main buildings survived.
“There's not one person here who wasn't affected in some way, shape or form,” Warren said. “Some lost their homes, some didn't, but the whole community definitely was impacted, because chances are they knew a friend or family member who did.”
The district postponed the start of school for two weeks, giving an additional four weeks to Greenville students, who were offered independent study or the option to attend another school within the Plumas county district. Since much of the area did not have dependable wifi, Greenville elementary schoolteacher Maria Johnson said she printed out learning packets and delivered them to students so they could stay on track with their education. Still, many of the residents remained displaced, and fewer than half the town's students from the previous year registered with Greenville schools after the fire.
Meanwhile, Warren and the other district staff navigated the bureaucracy of the disaster recovery system, reaching out to state and federal officials for assistance. Though Greenville's school buildings had survived the fire physically, they were unsafe for students: there was no electricity, debris was all around, and hazardous chemicals had been found in the ground and water. But because the buildings were intact, the schools were ineligible for most recovery funding, and regulations made it difficult to cope by shifting around resources. Warren offered one example of red tape she encountered, recalling how they had to appeal directly to the governor's office just to use a multipurpose hall from another campus as a cafeteria.
At the same time, Plumas county was still dealing with Covid-19. In October, there was an outbreak that sent home teachers and about a third of the students, Warren estimated. Another wave followed around the holidays, and this time so many staff got sick that Warren had to step in as a substitute teacher.
“You just add on all the recovery and the trauma and Covid, and everyone's just tired,” Warren told me in February, during another outbreak. “Everyone's job is different; no one's doing what they were hired to do three years ago.”
After recess on the August day I visited, Warren snapped a selfie in the refurbished gym and watched the newly made wooden welcome sign be placed in the front of the elementary school. It had been just over a year since the Dixie fire, and the Greenville schools were surrounded by properties in the early stages of construction. Warren told me how much it meant to see students and staff back on this campus again, especially since it almost didn't happen.
The school's wifi, which is currently supplied by a large temporary tower behind the buildings, was unreliable; there was no air conditioning, and temperatures that first week were expected to soar into the 90s. Ultimately, Warren said, the administrators and staff still agreed it was worth moving forward (and getting fans). Being back in the classroom would give the teachers a chance to better address the trauma students had experienced; already, some teachers told Warren they'd noticed how some students flinched whenever the bells rang, and there was a lot of anxiety around the idea of fire drills. Warren said she believed it was for the community to see the school reopen too: The busy campus stood as a sign of progress and hope.
Warren ended the day back at her desk in the nearby town of Quincy. She fielded phone calls from colleagues and state officials while checking on how many students had actually returned, compared with how many they'd expected. In Greenville, the numbers were still dozens shy of their 2020 tallies, but up from last year by nearly 50 students.
Overall, the first days back had been a success, but there were still challenges to tackle. One teacher was out with Covid-19, and there was the larger issue of the district's teacher shortage – they were looking to fill about a dozen spots, and the lack of affordable housing since the fire made finding replacements even harder. The hot weather also served as a reminder of teacher requests, like the social studies department's plea for more physical textbooks since technology could not always be relied on during warmer months. Here in northern California, the growing wildfire risk has made public safety power shutoffs a regular feature of recent autumns. in many of the district's schools, bright yellow air purifiers line the halls in case of smoky days.
Warren has added yet another responsibility to her roster in recent months: she has begun sharing her district's experience of disaster recovery with other school administrators. Climate change is making extreme weather events increasingly severe and common, and a Government Accountability Office study found more than half of the nation's public school districts are located in counties that were officially declared disaster areas between 2017 and 2019. Warren's hard-earned knowledge will prove increasingly useful to other fire-threatened rural communities in the west.
“Now we have our story,” Warren said, “and we're able to help others”.

2022-09-05,She thought Covid-19 was the worst thing to happen to her schools. Then the fire came,US NEWS; Version:1,"Lawyers representing patients at a southern California psychiatric hospital describe the state-run facility as a “tinderbox” for Covid-19 infections.
In documents filed earlier this week  in federal court, attorneys from the advocacy organization Disability Rights California and the private law firm Covington & Burling asked the judge Jesus G Bernal to order the release or transfer of half of the patients at Patton state hospital.
Patton is located in San Bernardino, east of Los Angeles. With 1,527 beds, it is one of the largest psychiatric hospitals in the US. The majority of people confined to the facility have been accused of a crime but found by a judge to be incompetent to stand trial or not guilty by reason of insanity.
Since May, at least 335 Patton patients and 327 staff have tested positive for Covid-19; 10 patients have died, according to court documents and the Department of State Hospitals (DSH) patient tracker. 
The attorneys' emergency request is part of a class-action lawsuit  filed in August on behalf of four men committed to Patton. Prior to the lawsuit, several organizations, including the California Public Defenders Association and the ACLU of Northern California, urged the department of state hospitals to evaluate patients for release or transfer to facilitate social distancing.
Some patients “no longer need treatment in a secure and locked facility”, the organizations said in a letter to Stephanie Clendenin, the head of DSH. “Many have family or friends to support them in the community if released.”
The letter echoes pleas from medical experts, who have said since the start of the pandemic that the only way to prevent Covid-19 outbreaks in crowded correctional facilities is to significantly reduce the population.
Nobody warned us
  Charles Gluck    
Anne Hadreas, an attorney with Disability Rights California, said she and her colleagues met several times with DSH officials, but were unable to reach an agreement over how to reduce the hospital's population. They filed the emergency request after learning of a new outbreak at Patton.
“Based on the staggeringly high numbers we couldn't wait any longer,” she said.
Since mid-November, more than 150 Patton detainees have tested positive for Covid-19, including all four of the plaintiffs named in the lawsuit. Eleven people have been hospitalized with severe cases of the virus.
“Defendants have failed to conduct an adequate systematic review of high-risk patients in order to identify who can be safely discharged to a less dangerous setting; facilitate the release or transfer of such high-risk patients to safer, non- or less-congregate settings; or otherwise reduce the patient population to allow for anything close to adequate social distancing,” the new court filing says.
Sworn statements submitted by patients as part of the lawsuit describe an environment where social distancing is impossible. Patients sleep as many as five to a room, share bathrooms, eat in the same area, use the same telephones and gather in the same common area. Patients also described Patton as unsanitary and lacking ventilation.
Charles Gluck, one of the lawsuit's plaintiffs, told the Guardian that staff never explained the threat the virus posed. Gluck has diabetes, heart disease and high blood pressure; he learned from watching television that his health conditions put him at risk for complications if he contracted Covid-19.
“Nobody warned us,” he said.
Gluck recently tested positive for Covid-19. Over the phone, he sounded run down. He said he had a fever and pain in his kidneys and hadn't been able to sleep.
Gluck's roommate, Ricardo Tapia, also contracted the virus. Tapia said more than 20 people in their unit fell ill after a man who was showing symptoms was moved to the unit at the beginning of December. The man was supposed to remain in his room, but he used the unit's communal restroom and would often open his door.
Tapia and Gluck were both moved to an isolation unit with large dorm-style rooms with up to a dozen other patients. Both men said there is little to do besides watching television.
“There's no treatment here,” Tapia said, referring to therapeutic programs that have been put on hold since March.
A spokesman for DSH said he couldn't discuss specific allegations in the lawsuit, but said that “DSH continues to take all actions necessary to protect its patients and staff from Covid-19, following guidance from the California Department of Public Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and other state and local partners.”
In their response to the plaintiffs' emergency request, state attorneys asked judge Bernal to halt all further proceedings because Covid-19 vaccines could render the lawsuit moot.
“DSH anticipates that a sufficient number of doses of an approved Covid-19 vaccine will be made available for inoculation of more than half of DSH healthcare staff in the highest level priority category in early January 2021,” the attorneys argued.
The fact that in the future conditions may improve does not change the fact that conditions are extremely dangerous now
  Anne Hadreas    
Hadreas, the lead attorney on the emergency filing, said that waiting until January, when only a portion of staff might be inoculated, isn't an option.
“It will not help the people who are getting sick right now, and those who will get sick over the next weeks,” she said. “The fact that at some point in the future conditions may improve does not change the fact that conditions are extremely dangerous now.”
On 7 December, DSH did move 43 women from Patton to a “surge capacity” facility in Norwalk, a Los Angeles suburb. In a signed declaration, Peter Chin-Hong, an infectious disease specialist at the University of California, San Francisco and expert witness, called the move “necessary” yet inadequate. Chin-Hong chastised state officials for waiting until “an untenable number of patients have tested positive at DSH-Patton”, instead of proactively finding alternative facilities.
Chin-Hong was critical of the dorm-style isolation units, noting that a person with Covid-19 can acquire a more serious infection by being exposed to others with the virus. There is also a risk for reinfection.
“It is important to note that immunity may be short-lived, setting the stage for potential reinfection even after recovery,” he wrote.
Hadreas acknowledged that moving people from Patton will require careful assessment.
“It's really not a one-size-fits-all approach, and that's not what we're asking for,” she said, adding, “The only way to make it a safer environment is for there to be fewer people for social distancing to be possible.”
A hearing on the emergency order is scheduled for 22 December.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); LAWYERS (92%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); LITIGATION (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); JUDGES (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); SUITS & CLAIMS (90%); US STATE GOVERNMENT (90%); PRIVATELY HELD COMPANIES (89%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (89%); INSANITY DEFENSE (79%); LAW & LEGAL SYSTEM (79%); AGREEMENTS (78%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); LAW COURTS & TRIBUNALS (78%); NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (78%); NEGATIVE NEWS (77%); PUBLIC DEFENDERS (74%); CORRECTIONS (72%); DISABLED PERSONS (72%); PRISONS (65%)

2020-12-18,California psychiatric hospital's Covid-19 outbreak has sickened almost 700,US NEWS; Version:1,"The UK's four chief medical officers have agreed the Covid-19 alert level should move from level 4 to level 3, thanks to the success of the vaccination programme and social distancing restrictions.
This means the epidemic is in general circulation but transmission of the virus is no longer deemed to be high or rising exponentially.
Boris Johnson will hold a press conference in Downing Street later on Monday to announce the next steps in England's roadmap out of lockdown.
A statement from the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales, as well as the NHS England national medical director, Prof Stephen Powis, said: ""Following advice from the Joint Biosecurity Centre and in the light of the most recent data, the UK chief medical officers and NHS England national medical director agree that the UK alert level should move from level 4 to level 3.
""Thanks to the efforts of the UK public in social distancing and the impact we are starting to see from the vaccination programme, case numbers, deaths and Covid hospital pressures have fallen consistently.
""However Covid is still circulating with people catching and spreading the virus every day so we all need to continue to be vigilant. This remains a major pandemic globally.
""It is very important that we all continue to follow the guidance closely and everyone gets both doses of the vaccine when they are offered it.""
Johnson is expected to confirm that England can press ahead with the next phase out of lockdown from 17 May, which allows more freedoms in and outdoors.
Azra Ghani, a professor of infectious disease epidemiology at Imperial College London, said ""The reduction from alert level 4 to level 3 is appropriate because transmission of the virus is now being maintained at a low level - due to the combined effect of a high uptake in vaccination and the restrictions that have been in place. It will however be important to monitor carefully as the next stage of unlocking occurs to ensure that virus circulation does not increase.
""The remaining focus as we go forwards into the summer and look to next autumn will be to ensure that variants of concern are not able to establish and grow, particularly if these may threaten the efficacy of the vaccines.
""Longer term, it is likely that booster vaccines that address the main mutations can be given to reduce any further risk.""
Others also urged caution, noting that cases remained higher than in early September and there were areas of the country where infection levels were high.
The rapid rise in cases of a "" variant of concern"" first detected in India , called B.1.617.2, has also caused consternation: on Thursday the Guardian  revealed clusters of this variant have been found across England , with some linked to community transmission, while Public Health England has said there is evidence to suggest B.1.617.2 is at least as transmissible as B.1.1.7, the ""Kent variant"" that currently dominates in the UK.
Speaking at a press briefing on Monday, experts said it was too soon to be sure just how problematic B.1.617.2 may be.
""At the moment there is just not enough information to say whether this causes more severe disease or not, but there is no reason for me at the moment to think that it does,"" said Prof Sharon Peacock of the University of Cambridge, who is executive director and chair of the Covid-19 Genomics UK (COG-UK) Consortium. More data is needed to be sure just how transmissible the variant is compared with others, she added.
However, Prof Ravi Gupta of the University of Cambridge said it was possible the Indian variant, or even the South African one, could become dominant in the UK - although he noted CogUK was now able to sequence specimens rapidly, aiding detection and action.
""We have very low transmission in the UK, so there is an opening in a way for a virus that is better adapted to vaccinated people to start transmitting,"" he said, although he noted this would not cause severe disease, or death, in the majority of people. ""It all depends on the dynamics of transmission and how quickly we can detect them and close them off.""","COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); VACCINES (91%); VIRUSES (91%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); EXECUTIVES (90%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (89%); MORBIDITY RATES (79%); PANDEMICS (78%); PRESS CONFERENCES (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS (75%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (74%)

2021-05-10,UK downgrades Covid-19 alert threat level,WORLD NEWS; Version:2,"Three Vermont state troopers have resigned after being accused of creating fake Covid-19 vaccination cards, state police announced  Tuesday.
In a statement released on Tuesday, Vermont police said the three former troopers are suspected of having ""varying roles"" in creating false Covid-19 vaccine cards.
""Based on an initial internal review, we do not believe there is anything more the state police could have done to prevent this occurring. As soon as other troopers became aware of this situation, they raised the allegations internally,"" said Vermont public safety commissioner Michael Schirling.
Shawn Sommers and Raymond Witkowski resigned on 10 August after a colleague raised suspicions about the alleged fraud to supervisors. A few weeks later, David Pfindel resigned on 3 September after Vermont's Department of Public Safety completed its investigation into the matter.
Colonel Matthew Birmingham, director of the Vermont State Police, condemned the troopers' actions, saying, ""I'm embarrassed that this situation has occurred and know that it has tarnished the reputation of the Vermont State Police. That said, the alleged criminal conduct from these troopers does not represent the values and actions of the dedicated and women of the Vermont State Police.""
The state police was unable to announce the troopers' resignation before Tuesday or provide additional case details due to an ongoing investigation by the FBI. It remains unclear why and for whom the troopers allegedly fabricated the cards.
In addition to the FBI, the matter has been referred to the US attorney's office in Burlington.
As pandemic restrictions get lifted, fraudulent vaccination cards are increasingly emerging across the US, as some unvaccinated people try to evade vaccine proof requirements to enter public spaces such as concerts, restaurants and schools.
Last month, US Customs and Border Protection announced  that it has seized more than 3,000 fake vaccination cards this year in Memphis, with officers intercepting shipments of the counterfeit documents every night.","POLICE FORCES (99%); VACCINES (95%); INVESTIGATIONS (92%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); NEGATIVE NEWS (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); RESIGNATIONS (90%); SAFETY (90%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (90%); VACCINE CERTIFICATIONS & PASSPORTS (90%); SPECIAL INVESTIGATIVE FORCES (89%); CRIMINAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); FEDERAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); INTERNAL INVESTIGATIONS (78%); MISCONDUCT (78%); NEGATIVE CRIME & LEGAL NEWS (78%); SAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (78%); COUNTERFEITING & FORGERY (73%); EXCISE & CUSTOMS (62%)

2021-09-08,Three Vermont state troopers accused of creating fake Covid-19 vaccination cards,US NEWS; Version:1,"YouTube has suspended the conservative news outlet One America News Network from posting new videos for a week and from making money off of its existing videos after it promoted a sham cure for Covid-19.
The video was removed under YouTube's policies to prevent the spread of Covid-19 misinformation, which prohibit saying there is a guaranteed cure to the virus. OANN has been suspended for “repeated violations” of this policy, said a YouTube spokeswoman, Ivy Choi.
“Since early in this pandemic, we've worked to prevent the spread of harmful misinformation associated with Covid-19 on YouTube,” Choi said.
YouTube's Covid-specific misinformation policies prohibit content that disputes the existence of the virus, discourages someone from seeking medical treatment for Covid, disputes guidance from local health authorities on the pandemic, or offers unsubstantiated medical advice or treatment.
Under these policies, an offending account will receive one warning for posting misinformation and then three strikes before it is permanently removed from the platform. The strikes carry progressively more severe penalties, including de-monetization. OANN previously received a warning for “similarly violating our Covid-19 misinformation policy,” according to YouTube.
The company said it has manually reviewed and removed 200,000 videos related to dangerous or misleading Covid-19 information since February 2020, including for example a widely condemned  viral video published by rightwing media outlet Breitbart featuring dubious claims from people identifying themselves as doctors, telling people not to wear masks.
While the suspension from posting new videos is temporary, YouTube says the de-monitization of all OANN content will be permanent, unless the network addresses its issues.
Tuesday's removal comes after four Democratic senators sent a letter on Tuesday  to YouTube's chief executive officer, Susan Wojcicki, pressing the company to do more to crack down on election-related misinformation.
Meanwhile, after breaking with longtime ally Fox News, Donald Trump has urged his supporters to turn to news outlets such as Newsmax and OANN. These outlets openly support Trump and, without evidence, cast doubt on the validity of the election of Joe Biden. YouTube said it does not consider OANN an “authoritative news source”, meaning under its policies the account will not surface high up in search results for broad queries about Covid-19 nor be promoted in recommendations.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (95%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); HEALTH MISINFORMATION (93%); CONSERVATIVE MEDIA (91%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PHOTO & VIDEO SHARING (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (89%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (89%); VIRAL VIDEOS (79%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (78%); FINES & PENALTIES (78%); US DEMOCRATIC PARTY (78%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012 (78%); VIRUSES (78%); MEDICAL TREATMENTS & PROCEDURES (74%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (71%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (69%); EXECUTIVES (50%)

2020-11-24,OANN suspended from YouTube after promoting a sham cure for Covid-19,TECHNOLOGY; Version:2,"A case of Covid-19 in Victoria is being treated as a rare case of reinfection, the first case classified as such in Australia.
Reinfection with Covid-19 is rare, with only a six cases reported among the 40m cases worldwide to date, including in the US and Hong Kong. It seems that in most cases of Covid-19, people develop immunity to the virus after being infected, though it is still unclear how strong this immunity is or for how long it remains.
In the Hong Kong case, a 33-year-old man was diagnosed with the virus more than four months after he recovered from his first infection of the disease, with genomic sequencing finding the man had been infected with two different strains. However, his reinfection was asymptomatic, indicating he may have had some clinical immunity.
The Victorian case is less clear. Genomic sequencing has not yet been completed, but the premier Daniel Andrews said the man first tested positive to the virus in July. He tested positive again in October. In many cases it is unclear whether a second positive test is truly a reinfection or merely dead virus being shed.
 Andrews announced the possible reinfection on Wednesday saying the man was being treated as a reinfected case ""out of an abundance of caution"".
An expert panel had ""reviewed this particular case and concluded there wasn't enough evidence to say that the positive test presented viral shedding, so the case is being monitored closely, and it is through an abundance of caution that we are assuming that it is a positive case, rather than the person shedding after the original infection,"" he said.
""There have been very few reported cases of reinfection around the world. It is also the case that persistent shedding over a long period of time can be a feature of this virus. This is understandably frustrating for everyone involved, whether this is in fact a positive case or not, but we do take a very cautious approach, and I think that is the best way to go.""
Dr Larisa Labzin, from the University of Queensland's Institute for Molecular Bioscience, said for the sake of Victoria's accurate tracking of Covid-19 transmission, it was important for the department of health to determine if this is indeed reinfection or a persistent original infection.
""It is important to note that after we clear an infection we are not necessarily protected from reinfection if we are re-exposed to the virus, but we anticipate that we are protected from developing severe disease,"" Labzin said.
""This can be determined by genetically sequencing the virus during the first and the second test and comparing the viral sequences. The virus accumulates enough small changes with time that we can distinguish a virus that was caught in July from a virus that was caught now.
""The alternative is that the person who caught Covid in July never truly cleared that original infection, in which case this wouldn't be a 'new' case of Covid-19.""
Guardian Australia has contacted the department of health to ask whether genomic sequencing is currently under way, and what methods were used to determine the case as one of reinfection, but is yet to receive as reply. Although the Australian case is ""interesting,"" Associate Professor in epidemiology at La Trobe University, Hassan Vally, warned there was so far little detail to go on.
""It's really important not to attach too much weight to this finding,"" he said. ""We do know that whilst infection by some viruses leads to lifelong immunity, there are others for which infection only leads to relatively short-term immunity. ""Since we have only coexisted with SARS-CoV-2 [Covid-19] for less than a year, it is not certain what the immunological characteristics of infection are yet. So far, however, there have been very few cases of reinfection reported. We also know about the law of truly large numbers, which says that with a large enough number of samples improbable events do occur. We have obviously seen a very large number of infections now around the world and so we will start to see unlikely events occur.
""No doubt there will be more done to try and understand more completely what has happened in this case, with it being recognised that if we start to see more reinfections as time goes on - which points to immunity being short-term in some individuals - this has obvious implications for how effective a vaccine or vaccines will be.""
Associate Professor Sanjaya Senanayake, a specialist in infectious diseases, said some people can shed the virus for a prolonged period after an infection, sometimes for more than 100 days.
""This may yet be the case here,"" he said. ""If, however, this turns out to be true reinfection with Covid-19, this will be an important case globally, especially to see if the second illness is milder than the first. Hopefully, they will get better soon.""","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); VIRUSES (93%); CORONAVIRUSES (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); BIOTECHNOLOGY & GENETIC SCIENCE (89%); DISEASE REPORTING (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); GENETIC ANALYTIC TECHNIQUES (89%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (79%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (77%); GENOMICS (74%); MOLECULAR BIOLOGY (69%)

2020-10-21,Australia may have recorded first case of Covid-19 reinfection,WORLD NEWS; Version:1,"Joe Biden, striving to restore public confidence in his handling of the pandemic, announced new vaccination mandates on Thursday for 100 million workers, about two-thirds of the American labour force.
Channeling national frustration as the virus surges back, the US president adopted his sternest tone yet in reprimanding the tens of millions of Americans who are still not vaccinated against the coronavirus.
""We can and we will turn the tide of Covid-19,"" he said firmly. ""It'll take a lot of hard work and it's going to take some time. Many of us are frustrated with the nearly 80 million Americans who are still not vaccinated even though the vaccine is safe, effective and free.""
Biden's speech in the state dining room of the White House, against a backdrop of Abraham Lincoln's portrait and with watching reporters crammed tightly, was seen as a high-profile attempt to claw back momentum and offer reassurance to Americans feeling despair about whether the pandemic will ever end.
The president unveiled a six-pronged strategy, relying on regulatory powers and other steps. He said the Department of Labor was developing an emergency temporary standard  that  will require all employers with more than 100 employees to ensure their workers are vaccinated or tested weekly.
This will affect more than 80 million workers in private sector businesses. Companies that do not comply could face fines of up to nearly $14,000 per violation.
Biden said: ""The bottom line: we're going to protect vaccinated workers from unvaccinated co-workers. We're going to reduce the spread of Covid-19 by increasing the share of the workforce that is vaccinated in businesses all across America.""
The move provoked instant criticism from conservatives sceptical of government overreach. Kevin Stitt, the governor of Oklahoma, said: ""It is not the government's role to dictate to private businesses what to do.""
The administration will also require all workers in healthcare settings that receive Medicaid or Medicare reimbursement be vaccinated ,  a move that applies to 50,000 providers and covers more than 17 million healthcare workers .
Biden has signed executive orders requiring vaccinations for all federal government workers as well as for employees of contractors that do business with the federal government. The move represents a toughening of measures that Biden announced in late July,  requiring federal workers to offer proof of vaccination or submit to regular testing and physical distancing measures in the workplace.
He said: ""Today, in total, the vaccine requirements in my plan will affect about 100 million Americans, two-thirds of all workers.""
In another nod to public desire for life to get back to normal, the president called on entertainment venues such as sports arenas and big concert halls to require that patrons be vaccinated or show a negative test for entry.
Biden seemed to be on course to effectively defeat the virus in early July, but has been accused of underestimating the highly contagious Delta variant and the intransigence of millions of unvaccinated Americans.
The fresh wave, combined with America's shambolic withdrawal from Afghanistan, threatens to inflict lasting political damage on Biden and derail his ambitious legislative agenda. His approval rating has dipped below 50% in opinion polls.
Biden gave voice to those who accuse the unvaccinated of holding the nation back and putting public safety at risk. ""My message to unvaccinated Americans is this: what more is there to wait for? What more do you need to see? We've made vaccinations free, safe and convenient.""
He added: ""We've been patient but our patience is wearing thin and your refusal has cost all of us. So please, do the right thing.""
He went on the rebuke air travellers who ignore mask rules. ""TSA will double the fines on travelers that refuse to mask. If you break the rules be prepared to pay. And by the way, show some respect!""
The second prong of the new plan aims to offer further protection for the more than 175 million people who are already fully vaccinated. This includes preparing to make booster shots available as soon as the Food and Drug Administration and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention  (CDC) grant approval.
Biden also called for governors to require vaccinations for teachers and school staff; currently only nine states have such measures in place.
Mask mandates have become a toxic political issue, with the Republican governors of some states, such as Florida and Texas, seeking to ban them only to face dissent from some school districts and legal challenges. About 45 million children under the age of 12 are not yet eligible for vaccination.
Biden said: ""Right now, local school officials are trying to keep children safe in a pandemic while their governor picks a fight with them and even threatens their salaries or their jobs. Talk about bullying in schools. If they'll not help, these governors will not help us beat the pandemic, I will use my powers as president to get them out of the way.""
He promised that the Department of Education would make additional funding available to help local school districts backfill salaries and other funding where it has been withheld by state leaders for implementing safety measures .
The administration will also require vaccinations for teachers and staff at Head Start and Early Head Start programmes, teachers at the Department of Defense, and teachers and staff at Bureau of Indian Education-operated schools. These schools and programmes serve more than 1 million children a year and employ nearly 300,000 staff.
The plan pushes for accelerated production of rapid Covid-19 tests, including at-home tests, seeks to protect the economic recovery by helping more than 150,000 small businesses and improves care for people with Covid-19 by giving additional help to hospitals currently overwhelmed.
More than 208 million Americans have received at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and 177 million are fully vaccinated, but confirmed cases of the virus have soared in recent weeks to an average of about 140,000 per day, with about 1,000 people dying from the virus daily, according to data from the CDC.
Most of the spread and the vast majority of severe illness and death is occurring among those not yet fully vaccinated against the virus, predominantly in areas that voted for Donald Trump in last year's presidential election. 
Biden, who ignored shouted questions from reporters, added: ""What makes it incredibly more frustrating is we have the tools to combat Covid-19, and a distinct minority of Americans, supported by a distinct minority of elected officials, are preventing us from turning the corner.""","COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); MANDATORY COVID VACCINATIONS (90%); MANDATORY VACCINATIONS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (90%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (90%); VACCINES (90%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (89%); LABOR FORCE (89%); MEDICAID (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); MANDATORY COVID TESTING (78%); VIRUSES (78%); EXECUTIVE ORDERS (77%); FINES & PENALTIES (77%); CONSERVATISM (73%); LABOR DEPARTMENTS (73%); VACCINE CERTIFICATIONS & PASSPORTS (73%); CIVIL SERVICES (67%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (65%); MEDICARE (62%); STADIUMS & ARENAS (60%)

2021-09-09,Biden announces new US vaccine mandates to 'turn the tide of Covid-19',US NEWS; Version:9,"Marcus Lamb, the co-founder of the leading Christian TV network Daystar who railed against Covid-19 vaccines, has died of Covid-19. He was 64 years old.
Lamb, who was the chief executive of the conservative network that reaches an estimated 2 billion viewers worldwide, died on Tuesday, weeks after contracting the coronavirus.
""It's with a heavy heart we announce that Marcus Lamb, president and founder of Daystar Television Network, went home to be with the Lord this morning,"" the network announced in a tweet  on Tuesday. ""The family asks that their privacy be respected as they grieve this difficult loss. Please continue to lift them up in prayer.""
Under his leadership, Daystar aired repeated baseless anti-vaccine conspiracy theories and claims that vaccines were being used to take freedoms away from Christians. In July 2020, the network spent an hour of air time complaining about ""censorship"" around the pandemic and also gave an hour's slot to Robert F Kennedy Jr, who has spread misinformation about the Covid vaccine.
Covid vaccines have been repeatedly found to be safe and effective at preventing severe illness from the virus. Evangelical Christians have been getting the vaccines at lower rates than the general US population, however, and several prominent Christian broadcasters have died of the virus in recent months.
Last month Lamb's son Jonathan said that his father's illness was due to sinister outside forces.
""There's no doubt in my mind that this is a spiritual attack from the enemy,"" he said, adding that Lamb has pushed alternative therapies and that ""there's no doubt that the enemy is not happy about that. And he's doing everything he can to take down my Dad.""
Daystar was founded in 1998 and has more than 100 TV stations around the world. Lamb's wife Joni, appearing on the daily Ministry Show on Tuesday, said that he had ""got the Covid pneumonia"".
""He 100% believed in everything we talk about here on Daystar, things that help so many people around the world with early protocol treatments for Covid,"" she said. ""We still stand by those obviously.""",,347,The Guardian (London)
2021-12-01,Co-founder of Christian TV network that railed against vaccines dies of Covid-19,WORLD NEWS; Version:2,"A website dedicated to sharing images of Covid-19-related skin rashes to help doctors and patients identify whether an unusual rash might be a sign of coronavirus infection has been criticised for containing just two images of black or brown skin.
The British Association of Dermatologists' (BAD) Covid-19 Skin Patterns  website features 400 images of Covid-associated rashes, from prickly heat and chickenpox-type rashes to raised itchy hives and chilblain-like ""Covid fingers and toes"". 
They were gathered by the Covid Symptom Study app in response to growing evidence that skin rashes are a key feature of the disease, present in around 9% of app users testing positive for Covid-19. In children they may be even more predictive, with a sixth of children experiencing a rash and no other symptoms.
""Being able to recognise these is crucial for reducing the spread of [Covid-19],"" said the president of BAD, Dr Tanya Bleiker. 
Ore Odubiyi, the director of BME Medics, a platform committed to improving diversity and inclusion in healthcare, said the lack of images showing how Covid rashes manifest on people of darker skin tones may mean healthcare professionals are less equipped to diagnose potential cases.
""When we consider that certain BAME communities in the UK are disproportionately impacted by Covid-19, it is crucial that visual resources which show how Covid-related skin changes may appear in darker skin tones are made readily available at a similar standard seen in resources exemplifying signs of disease in fairer skin tones.""
Around 3,000 images of suspected Covid rashes were uploaded via the app, but although the survey specifically requested images from BAME groups, only 173 were received. ""This may be explained, in part, by cultural factors but also because rashes are less visible on darker skin and may have been difficult to photograph,"" said a spokesperson for BAD, adding that they had to cull those that were not of sufficient quality or had other issues identified by reviewers.
Dr Ifeoma Ejikeme, a cosmetic doctor and founder of the Adonia Medical Clinic in London, said: ""At this point, I would rather put up poor quality images than no images. They now need to be speaking to and liaising with GPs to get those pictures.""
The problem isn't confined only to Covid-19. ""There are so many situations in which black people may not present themselves to medical professionals because they may not recognise themselves in the language or the pictures that we use typically use,"" said Margot Turner, a senior lecturer in diversity and medical education at St George's, University of London, and co-author of a new handbook of clinical signs on black and brown skin. 
For instance, meningitis awareness posters often talk about looking out for a red rash, which can be difficult to see on darker skin, and bruising is also less obvious, which may result in fewer cases of domestic violence being detected during GP visits, she said.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (97%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); DERMATOLOGY (91%); SKIN DISORDERS (91%); VIRUSES (91%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (90%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PHOTO & VIDEO SHARING (90%); PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (89%); CHICKEN POX (78%); COSMETIC SURGERY & TREATMENTS (78%); INFLAMMATORY DISEASES (78%); PROFESSIONAL WORKERS (78%); COLD INJURIES (73%); MEDICAL EDUCATION (73%); MENINGITIS (73%); DIVERSITY & INCLUSION (72%); NEUROLOGICAL DISORDERS & INJURIES (72%)

2020-09-28,Covid-19 skin rash website criticised for lack of BAME examples,WORLD NEWS; Version:2,"A small rise in people's long-term exposure to air pollution is associated with an 11% increase in deaths from Covid-19, research has found. Another recent study suggests that 15% of all Covid-19 deaths around the world are attributable to dirty air.
The available data only allows correlations to be established and further work is needed to confirm the connections, but the researchers said the evidence was now strong enough that levels of dirty air must be considered a key factor in handling coronavirus outbreaks.
The new analysis is based on research reported by the Guardian in April, which has now been reviewed by independent scientists and published in a prominent journal. The consideration of additional data and more factors that may also influence Covid-19 death rates refined the rise in deaths from 15% down to 11%.
Most scientists think it is very likely that air pollution increases the number and severity of Covid-19 cases. Breathing dirty air over years is already known to cause heart and lung disease, and these illnesses make coronavirus infections worse. Short-term exposure is also known to increase the risk of acute lung infections.
The gold-standard method for confirming the link between air pollution and Covid-19 would be to assess a large number of coronavirus patients on an individual level, so their age, smoking history and other details can be taken into account. 
Such data, however, is not yet available so given the urgency of the pandemic researchers have used data on groups of people. This can be strongly indicative of a link, but may hide important individual factors.
There are now hundreds of group-level studies, although most have yet to be reviewed, said Prof Francesca Dominici at Harvard University, who led the new analysis.
She said there was enough evidence to act immediately: ""Absolutely. We already have an overwhelming amount of evidence of the adverse health effects of fine particle pollution, so even without Covid, we should implement more stringent regulation. But the amount of [Covid-related] evidence is also big enough now that there is absolutely nothing to lose, and only benefits, to prioritise some of the more vulnerable areas.""
This could include cutting pollution and increasing healthcare and PPE availability in the most polluted places, she said: ""That's something that should happen and must happen. There is a lot of scientific evidence that makes us think that a virus that attacks our lungs, and kills you with viral pneumonia, might become more deadly if your lungs are compromised because you're breathing air pollution.""
The new research is published in the journal Science Advances. It considered the impact of a single-unit rise in average particle pollution over 16 years before the pandemic on Covid-19 deaths in 3,089 US counties, covering 98% of the population. 
It included the 116,747 deaths that occurred up to 18 June, when the study was submitted for review, and took account of more than 20 other factors, including population densities, state-level stay-at-home orders, hospital bed provision, and social and economic status.
""It is striking that only small differences in [pollution] levels are linked to significantly higher levels of Covid-19,"" said Mark Miller, an expert on the health impacts of air pollution at the University of Edinburgh, who was not involved in the analysis. 
""While this study was carried out in the US, there is no reason to believe that a similar situation wouldn't occur in the UK, or anywhere else in the world. Overall, these findings highlight a link that urgently needs further study.""
An editorial in Science Advances said the group-level method was valuable during a pandemic: ""The amount of time required for rigorous, extensive studies conflicts with the swift nature of the Covid-19 pandemic. Addressing the potential impact of air pollution on Covid-19 mortality requires a more nimble approach to environmental policy decision-making.""
The second study, published in the journal Cardiovascular Research, used global air pollution data and studies including the Harvard work to estimate the proportion of Covid-19 deaths attributable to long-term exposure to fine particles. 
They concluded 15% of worldwide deaths may have resulted from the damage dirty air causes to the heart and lungs. This would equate to more than 180,000 deaths, given the current total of 1.2 million coronavirus deaths.
The team also made estimates for countries, suggesting 27% of coronavirus deaths in China are attributable to air pollution, 26% in Germany, 18% in the US and 14% in the UK. They said studies were needed on individuals to confirm the results, but that they ""may appear too late to guide decision-making"".
Prof Anna Hansell, at the University of Leicester, said: ""While it is extremely likely that there is a link between air pollution and Covid-19 mortality, it is premature to attempt to precisely quantify it, given the current state of the evidence. 
""However, there are plenty of other good reasons to act now to reduce air pollution, which the WHO already links to 7 million deaths worldwide per year.""","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); VIRUSES (93%); AIR POLLUTION (92%); CORONAVIRUSES (92%); POLLUTION & ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACTS (92%); AIR QUALITY (90%); DEATH & DYING (90%); DEATH RATES (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); RESEARCH REPORTS (90%); RESPIRATORY DISORDERS & INJURIES (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); PARTICULATE MATTER (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH (89%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (89%); EXPERIMENTATION & RESEARCH (78%); PNEUMONIA (75%); HEART DISEASE (67%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (62%)

2020-11-04,Tiny air pollution rise linked to 11% more Covid-19 deaths - study,ENVIRONMENT; Version:1,"Covid-19 has dealt ""a huge financial blow"" to Australian charities and not-for-profits but many of the organisations were already under pressure prior to the pandemic, a new survey suggests.
With an ""unpredictable"" road to recovery ahead, many directors in the not-for-profit sector are worried about the looming rollback of the federal government's jobkeeper wage subsidy, according to the Australian Institute of Company Directors (AICD) poll.
The study - drawing on answers from 1,303 respondents from across the not-for-profit sector in July - provides an insight into the challenges facing the sector as it seeks to navigate the current crisis. Some 40% of surveyed organisations said they had made a loss in the previous three years.
The findings were also based on 10 virtual focus groups held with leaders working in areas covering mental health, education, arts, sport, child welfare, domestic violence, philanthropy, community housing, disability services as well as emergency and relief service providers.
The report, published by AICD on Thursday, says the pandemic has ""amplified the challenges that many organisations were already facing"".
""Covid-19 was the tide that went out and showed all those who were swimming naked,"" said one unnamed survey respondent cited in the report.
It notes profitability in health and aged care had already been going down for several years before facing another significant drop during the pandemic.
Only 48% of organisations surveyed expected to achieve a profit in the financial year ending June 2020, with the rest either making a loss or breaking even.
But in a sign the financial impacts varied widely across the sector, nearly two-thirds of social services organisations that responded to the survey reported they were likely to make a profit. That stood in contrast with the about 60% of health and residential aged care organisations and business and professional associations that anticipated breaking even or making a loss.
""Our research found significant variations in the impact of Covid-19 on organisations depending on such things as funding sources, timing, location and, in some cases, luck,"" the report says.
The AICD, which has produced an annual study on not-for-profit governance and performance since 2010, said Covid-19 had intensified pre-existing pressure ""pushing boards and organisations to their limits"".
""Just when demand for NFP services increased, their revenue took a huge hit,"" the institute's managing director, Angus Armour, said.
About 55% of the respondents said their organisation was receiving jobkeeper - while about a third were not eligible. Some 87% of directors reported being worried about the national economy, with a high degree of uncertainty about the future.
Armour described jobkeeper as ""nothing short of a lifeline for many"", but raised ""significant concerns"" about how organisations would manage when the current scheme ends in March next year.
""These organisations need to be able to continue their vital work through the pandemic and on the other side, but unless issues of funding are addressed, it is likely some will be forced to wind up,"" he said.
""Given the vital role these organisations play in our society, targeted assistance is required to ensure these organisations survive over the long-term.""
The report points to inadequate pre-pandemic baseline funding in certain not-for-profit sectors. It says organisations in human services sectors, such as aged care, disability and mental health, and the arts ""have struggled with inadequate funding, inefficient funding structures and inequitable distribution of support"".
Regarding the road to recovery, the report also suggests that not-for-profits should approach governments to suggest ways to use fiscal stimulus to achieve both economic and broader social objectives.
""For instance, some of the stimulus measures aimed at the construction industry could be allocated for rebuilding social infrastructure like social and affordable housing,"" the report says.
""Focus group participants cited concern about the ability to cater for future demand as the recession bites harder and an already stretched sector needs to respond.""",,694,The Guardian (London)
