China further optimised its COVID-19 control policies in a 10-point notice released on Wednesday. Below are some of the key adjustments.
Q: How will China categorise high-risk areas?
A: High-risk areas should be accurately defined by building, unit, floor and household, and must not be arbitrarily expanded to entire residential complexes and neighbourhoods. Any form of temporary lockdowns are prohibited.
Q: How to roll out nucleic acid tests?
A: The scope and frequency of nucleic acid tests should be further reduced and antigen tests can be rolled out based on local circumstances. High-risk personnel should take tests as required while testing services should be offered to those in need.
Public places should no longer require proof of negative nucleic acid testing results or check digital health codes of visitors except for elderly care and social welfare centres, medical facilities, nursery care centres and primary and middle schools. Cross-regional travellers are also waived from these requirements and are no longer required to take a test upon arrival.
Q: Can infected patients isolate at home?
A: In most cases, asymptomatic and mild cases can be isolated at home when home-based protocols are met, and health monitoring should be strengthened so as to be transferred to designated hospitals for treatment promptly. They can also voluntarily opt to stay in centralised quarantine facilities.
Q: How to boost COVID-19 vaccinations amongst the elderly?
A: Local authorities are urged to create targeted plans to accelerate vaccinations among those aged 60 and above, especially elderly aged 80 and above. Suggested measures include setting up temporary or mobile vaccination stations, establishing special queues for seniors to expedite inoculations, ramping up training for medical workers so they can better identify people with contraindications, and improving awareness campaigns to motivate people to get the shots.
Q: How to ensure safety and medical demands during local outbreaks?
A: Obstructing fire exits and apartment doors for the sake of COVID-19 control is strictly forbidden, and relevant authorities must ensure that people who are locked down have access to medical treatment and emergency escape routes.
Communities should connect with designated medical institutions to make medical services more convenient for minors, pregnant women, seniors who live alone and people with disabilities or chronic diseases. Psychological consultation and mental healthcare should also be stepped up for quarantined people, COVID-19 patients and frontline workers.","VACCINES (91%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); ISOLATION & QUARANTINE (89%); SENIOR CITIZENS (89%); SAFETY (78%); SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLE (73%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (72%); MEDICAL TREATMENTS & PROCEDURES (72%); PSYCHOLOGY (72%); EMPLOYEE TRAINING & ASSISTANCE (69%); WOMEN'S HEALTH (69%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (68%); CHRONIC DISEASES (66%); HEALTH CARE ACCESS (66%); DISABLED PERSONS (64%); MENTAL HEALTH (64%); MIDDLE & JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS (52%); PREGNANCY & CHILDBIRTH (50%)"

Higher risk
In Hainan province, where rural areas face an increasing risk of COVID-19 spreading, local governments and medical institutions are stepping up improvements to epidemic prevention and response work.
The number of people infected with COVID-19 each day in Hainan is surging.
Li Wenxiu, deputy director of the Hainan Provincial Health Commission, said at a news conference on Friday that rural areas of the province face a higher risk of a rapid growth in COVID-19 infections. This is due to the imminent arrival of 2023, Spring Festival, schools' winter vacation, and the return of urban migrant workers.
The province has established a five-level emergency response mechanism for fever clinics. As of Friday, there were 432 such clinics at medical institutions in Hainan. Each city and county in the province is required to build at least one mobile cabin hospital.
A special population diagnosis and treatment team has also been formed in Hainan. The team is responsible for ensuring prompt medical treatment for children, the elderly, expectant mothers and patients with severe diseases. The province has set up online treatment platforms for critical illness during childbirth and severe illness among children, with medical experts taking turns to man the platforms.
In rural areas, local governments are preparing to protect vulnerable populations as COVID-19 cases surge. The residential committee in Licai village, Sanya, has distributed 30 face masks per person to 87 vulnerable people, including low-income households and children with medical problems.
Local governments and medical institutions are also taking measures to ensure the supply of medication.
Li Shihua, director of Sandao Town Medical Center in Baoting Li and Miao autonomous county, said: ""We have enough antipyretic, analgesic and antiviral drugs in stock for seven to 10 days. The Baoting government is stepping up drug procurement through various channels to ensure that medicines are constantly replenished.""
Fu Yongfeng, director of Wenchang Huiwen Town Core Medical Center, said the facility prepared medicines three times based on the quantity of flu medication used from April to June.
Lin Shengwei, a doctor at the center responsible for fever diagnosis and treatment, said, ""Medication urgently needed at fever clinics is not only in stock, but is also arriving promptly, allowing us to cope with the current situation.""
In many towns and villages across Hainan, including Haikou, Sanya, Wenchang and Ding'an, residents with mobility issues can request vaccination at home.
An in-home vaccination team comprises at least three people - a village cadre or community worker, a doctor and a nurse. They have the ability to deal with adverse reactions on the spot.
Zhan Chunlian, a doctor at the core medical center in Huiwen town, Wenchang, said that after several campaigns to raise awareness of vaccination against COVID-19, only a small number of seniors in the area have still to be vaccinated.
For the elderly with diseases and concerns about vaccination, medical staff members in Huiwen use professional knowledge to help them understand vaccine safety, and also comfort patients by talking to them to help them relax, Zhan added.
Seniors with diseases who cannot clearly describe their symptoms usually bring their medical record and medication to doctors, who refer to the guidelines for vaccinating those who are 60 or older in Hainan. The guidelines explain whether those with certain diseases can be vaccinated. If there is no such explanation, doctors report the patient's medical record to the group of experts in Wenchang, and request a vaccination evaluation.
""Many seniors who were worried about being vaccinated felt fine afterward, and they thanked the doctors and asked when they could have their next shot,"" Zhan said.
Certain towns and villages in Hainan are short of medical workers due to a recent rise in demand for nucleic acid tests and medical diagnoses and treatment.
Some health workers have been infected, but they return to work as soon as they recover.
Lin said: ""Medical staff members in China are really hardworking and responsible. The COVID-19 response is our battlefield and we'll fight on the front line.""

Closed management has now been introduced in 36 universities and colleges in Fuzhou, Fujian province, and online teaching has been launched, a senior educational official from the eastern metropolis said.
In addition, nucleic acid testing has been launched on campuses according to relevant COVID-19 prevention and control policies to help fight against the pandemic among teachers and students, said You Xin, director of the Fuzhou education bureau, at a news conference on Wednesday.
Under the city's COVID-19 prevention and control measures, university and college staff and students living on campus are not allowed to leave, while those who are now living outside their universities and colleges have been banned from entering the campuses in principle, You said.
Classes for students at local high schools, primary schools and kindergartens were suspended in the city's nine districts and suburban counties between Tuesday and Sunday.
All schools and training institutions have been ordered to carry out online teaching to help prevent and control the spread of COVID-19 in Fuzhou.
""Only those with a green health code are allowed to attend the teacher qualification examination that will take place in the city on Saturday,"" You said.
Fuzhou reported 58 locally transmitted asymptomatic carriers on Tuesday, pushing the city's total number of local COVID-19 infections to 128 as of Tuesday.
Authorities said all infected people have been sent to designated hospitals for further medical observation and treatment.
Meanwhile, a makeshift hospital was built in the city's Olympic sports center, which is ready to open, local authorities said.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (90%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (90%); PRIMARY SCHOOLS (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH (77%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (77%); PRESS CONFERENCES (73%); HIGH SCHOOLS (72%); STUDENT HOUSING (72%); COUNTIES (68%); SPORTS & RECREATION FACILITIES & VENUES (63%); SUBURBS (53%)

Domestic cats may be providing a reservoir for the novel coronavirus, according to a new study that suggests close to 350,000 cats in the United Kingdom have been infected with COVID-19 so far during the pandemic.
Researchers at the University of Glasgow analyzed swabs taken from 2,309 cats that had routine checkups at veterinarians in the UK between April 2020 and February this year.
The study, which was published in the preprint server bioRxiv and that has not been peer-reviewed, found that 3.2 percent of the animals tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies.
There are an estimated 10.9 million pet cats in the UK, according to a report from the People's Dispensary for Sick Animals, and if the rate of infection from the study is consistent across the population, around 348,000 cats may have contracted the virus.
Glasgow researchers said that the findings justify further research into the impact of COVID-19 on feline health. There have also been documented cases of cats transmitting COVID-19 to humans, suggesting that the animals could provide a reservoir for the virus and its variants.
""Recent evidence confirming cat-to-human COVID-19 transmission has highlighted the importance of monitoring infection in domestic cats,"" said the authors of the study, led by Grace Tyson, a virologist at the University of Glasgow Centre for Virus Research.
""Although the effects of COVID-19 infection on feline health are poorly characterized, cats have close contact with humans, and with both domesticated and wild animals. Accordingly, they could act as a reservoir of infection, an intermediate host, and a source of novel variants.""
COVID-19 is thought to be a zoonotic disease, meaning it arose in non-human species before taking hold in the human population. The lack of coordinated international response at the start of the pandemic prompted numerous scientists to call for increased surveillance of pathogens in wild and domestic species that have the potential to infect humans.
Researchers argue that future outbreaks can be contained far more efficiently if they are discovered soon after the so-called zoonotic jump, the period in time when the disease makes the leap from animal to human.
""We need a whole army coming out ready to deal with the question of how the natural world and humanity can fit together in a way that does not have to involve infectious disease emergencies,"" said David Quammen, a science writer who has written several books on zoonotic viruses including Spillover, but who was not involved in the research. ""Disease surveillance is crucial. And that means having eyes and ears on the ground.""
Several animal species are known to be susceptible to the novel coronavirus, including dogs, cats, ferrets, hamsters, rhesus monkeys, rabbits, and fruit bats.
A research team, also from the Glasgow Centre for Virus Research, confirmed cases of human-to-cat COVID-19 transmission in 2020. The first recorded event of cat-to-human infection occurred in a veterinary clinic in Thailand this summer, though this form of transmission is thought to be rare.",CATS (95%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); RESEARCH REPORTS (93%); ANIMALS (90%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); VIRUSES (90%); DISEASE REPORTING (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); EPIDEMICS (89%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (89%); NOVELS & SHORT STORIES (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (89%); VIROLOGY (89%); WRITERS (89%); ZOONOTIC DISEASES (89%); LIFE FORMS (88%); SURVEILLANCE (86%); ANIMAL WELFARE (78%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); MAMMALS (78%); PETS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEILLANCE (78%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (78%); WILDLIFE (78%); ZOOLOGY (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (77%); POPULATION & DEMOGRAPHICS (76%); PRIMATES (76%); RODENTS (76%); DOGS (73%); MICROBIOLOGY (73%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (71%)

Residents in Chongqing are being asked not leave the city unless travel is urgent as it works to curb the spread of COVID-19 infections to other places, the city's prevention and control headquarters said on Tuesday.
Chongqing reported 126 new local confirmed COVID-19 cases and 2,688 new asymptomatic carriers on Tuesday, the local health commission said on Wednesday.
Local officials reiterated that Chongqing, a mega city of 32 million people, is facing ""unprecedented difficulty"" in curbing the virus since the outbreak began on Nov 1.
According to the notice released on Tuesday, residents living in quarantine and closed-loop management, areas with a high risk of infection or communities with people testing positive within seven days should not leave Chongqing.
For people who must leave the city, negative nucleic test results and some other documents are required.
In response to increases in infections, Chongqing has transformed a city exhibition center into makeshift hospital. On Tuesday, part of a makeshift hospital in the city's Yuelai International Exhibition Center was opened for use. It is designed with 12,000 beds.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); ISOLATION & QUARANTINE (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (77%); PUBLIC OFFICIALS (72%)

The National Healthcare Security Administration has announced that all the medicines listed in the COVID-19 treatment plan can be paid for through the healthcare security fund.
On Aug 9, the National Health Commission said that Azvudine, a Chinese drug approved for treating COVID-19, was included in the COVID-19 treatment plan. This way, patients can get part of the cost paid for by the healthcare security fund.
Society has long been expecting COVID-19 drugs to enter the market. China has long developed vaccines aimed at preventing the virus from infecting more people. The emerging drugs will further consolidate China's victory over the virus.
Azvudine, as the first domestically developed COVID-19 drug, has several advantages over foreign ones. It costs less than 300 yuan ($44.35) per bottle, which is largely affordable; it is an oral drug rather than injection, which makes it convenient to popularize it.
Besides, since Azvudine has long been used to fight AIDS and has recently been developed to fight COVID-19, its side-effects are known.
However, some believe that more clinical data is needed to prove its effectiveness. After all, Azvudine has not been tested yet for its effectiveness against COVID-19. That's possibly why the medicine has been ""temporarily"" included in the healthcare fund, creating room for a long-term decision to be taken after observation. In that way, the taxpayers' burden will not be that heavy.
More than two years into the COVID-19 pandemic, people are looking for an effective, cheap drug to counter it.
With the first domestically developed COVID-19 drug entering the market and getting included in the healthcare fund, there is more light at the end of the tunnel. Of course, one single drug is far from enough in fighting the pandemic, yet it highlights the spirit of doing scientific research for fighting the pandemic.
We look forward to more such drugs being developed to better serve the people in the fight against the pandemic.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); HEALTH CARE POLICY (90%); HEALTH CARE RATIONING (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY (78%); VACCINES (78%); AIDS & HIV (73%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (73%); EXPERIMENTATION & RESEARCH (65%)

Beijing announced the relaxation of several COVID-19 pandemic control measures on Wednesday night during a news conference, with rules relating to cross-city travel, medical services, and school all eased.
People are no longer required to provide negative results from nucleic acid tests or health codes in order to enter the capital, said Zhong Dongbo, deputy head of the city's health commission.
""They won't be asked to take three tests daily after their arrival in the city, either,"" he added.
However, the city will continue to provide nucleic acid tests for free, with a better layout of testing site locations.
Quarantine measures have also been relaxed, with infected people with no symptoms or mild symptoms now able to self-quarantine at home.
The city will also work to ensure there are adequate medical services, in the event of an increase in COVID-19 infections, Zhong said.
Qualified hospitals can now set up fever clinics, if they are able to do so.
Zhong also reminded people that there is no need to store up medicine. All drug stores, both online and offline, will ensure there is enough medicine to meet demand.
Schools without COVID-19 outbreaks should restart or continue on-campus courses.

The were 1,325 cases of COVID-19 detected in Guangzhou, capital of Guangdong province, on Saturday, including nine at the community level, a senior health official said on Sunday.
Zhang Yi, deputy director of the Guangzhou health commission, urged residents to actively cooperate with relevant departments and strictly abide by the city's epidemic prevention and control policies, while more concrete and effective measures are being introduced to help block the spread of the novel coronavirus.
The city is experiencing the most complex and severe COVID-19 prevention and control situation in three years, the official added.
The city, with a population of about 18 million, reported 746 infection cases on Friday, indicating hidden transmission chains still exist.
Zhang made her remarks at a news conference on Sunday, saying CCTV footage showed some residents in Haizhu district have violated the city's COVID-19 prevention and control policies and regulations.
The district, which has become the main battlefield in the fight against COVID-19 in Guangzhou, has been locked down to prevent and control the virus spread.
Except for those who have to go out to seek medical help or be tested for the virus, residents in Haizhu are required to stay at home for three days beginning Saturday. Only one person from each household is allowed to go out for shopping each day.
Of the city's new infections reported Saturday, 1,253 were detected in Haizhu.
Zhang Zhoubin, Party secretary of the Guangzhou Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said the number of newly infected cases detected in the district daily has reached a new high in this round of the outbreak.
He urged residents to maintain risk awareness and avoid any risky behavior in order to contribute to the city's COVID-19 prevention and control efforts.
According to Zhang Yi, more than 31,000 residents in Haizhu, where exhibition halls of the China Import and Export Fair are located, have been evacuated to other cities to help block the infection chain and lower the risk of spread in communities.
A makeshift hospital with 3,000 beds was put into operation on Saturday to help care for the growing number of infected residents.
In Beijing, the Chinese capital reported more COVID-19 infections at the community level, with the number of high- and medium-risk areas growing in the city this week.
According to data released on Sunday morning, Beijing recorded 43 confirmed locally transmitted COVID-19 cases and six asymptomatic cases on Saturday, among whom five were detected at the community level.
Beijing has reported several infection clusters involving dozens of cases in colleges and families in recent days, according to the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control.
The center reminded the public that people who are self-quarantined at home should reduce contact with other household members in order to cut infection risks.

The first monkeypox case in the Chinese mainland, an imported one, was reported in Chongqing on Friday. All the close contacts were timely quarantined, and no more cases have been reported since.
The case in Chongqing was detected during the COVID-19 quarantine measures for arrivals. The COVID-19 prevention and control measures have played an important role in preventing the monkeypox virus from being imported and spreading.
The incubation period of the monkeypox virus ranges from five to 21 days－it is from six to 13 days for most cases. The 10-day quarantine measures for COVID-19 prevention and control are therefore expected to enable most monkeypox cases arriving from abroad to be identified.
Take the transmission of the human immunodeficiency virus as an example, which was spread from Western countries to the Western Pacific region, it generally followed the route of from Europe and the United States to Australia, then to Singapore, Japan, Thailand, etc, then to the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region and the Taiwan island and then to the Chinese mainland.
Considering that Australia, Singapore and New Zealand are the only three countries in the Western Pacific that have more than five monkeypox cases, China can continue to rely on its COVID-19 prevention and control measures to screen monkeypox cases.
The transmission mode of monkeypox is complex, including contact with infected animal lesions, blood, etc, or infected animal bites or scratches. In this wave of monkeypox infections close contact between people is the most important mode of transmission, including contact with articles contaminated by patient secretions.
As the country implements strict COVID-19 prevention and control measures, there is no need for panic over the monkeypox virus, and the public only need to heed the warnings of the epidemic prevention and control departments and be familiar with the transmission model of the monkeypox virus. People should follow the COVID-19 protocols, as most of the measures targeting the monkeypox virus are similar to those required for COVID-19 prevention and control.",

Anthony Fauci, the White House's top medical adviser, said on Sunday the COVID-19 pandemic is not completely over, The Hill reported.
""So it's much, much better than it was, but it is not at a level low enough where we should feel we're done with it completely, because we're not,"" Fauci said during an appearance on CBS's ""Face the Nation"".
The White House on Nov 22 launched a ""six-week sprint"" to get more Americans their updated shots as officials struggle to increase uptake.
About 12 percent of the eligible population ages 5 and up in the US have received a dose of the booster shots that target recent variants, according to the CDC.
On the low uptake, Fauci said ""It's a combination of an expansion and an amplification of the anti-science, anti-vax.""
""There is something I've never seen in my 54 years in medicine at the [National Institutes of Health], is that the acceptance or not of a life-saving intervention is steered very heavily by your political ideology,"" he added.
Fauci announced in August he planned to step down next month from his roles in government as US President Joe Biden's chief medical adviser, as well as director of the National Institute of Allergies and Infectious Diseases since 1984.
As advice before he leaves office, he said repeatedly the pandemic is not over in the US, and vaccination is still very important.
""Please for your own safety and for that of your family, get your updated COVID-19 shot as soon as you're eligible,"" Fauci said on Nov 22 during a daily press briefing at the White House.

The central government has taken many measures and made continuous efforts since 2020 to protect people who have tested positive for COVID-19 against employment discrimination. For example, in 2020, it announced that workers from COVID-19 hotspots should not be discriminated against. But discrimination against recovered patients has not stopped due to uncertainties over the effects of the pandemic and some employers' and people's misconception about the novel coronavirus.
Therefore, the central authorities have stepped up efforts to protect the employment rights of recovered COVID-19 patients and thus ensure they are not discriminated against in the job market.
The Ministry of Human Resources and Social Security and the National Health Commission jointly released a document on Aug 1, barring employers and human resources agencies from refusing to hire people just because they had tested positive for, but recovered from, COVID-19. The document also prohibits employers from firing employees for just testing positive for COVID-19.
According to China's Labor Law and Employment Promotion Law, people have equal right to employment, so discrimination against people who have recovered from COVID-19 in the hiring process or the workplace is an infringement on their employment rights. The departments also made it clear that employers and human resources agencies should provide equal opportunities and treatment for workers and job seekers, and employees should not be discriminated against based on the Employment Promotion Law.
The Supreme People's Court, too, issued a guideline in 2020, saying employers should not terminate employees merely because they have been diagnosed with COVID-19, or are suspected to be infected with or are an asymptomatic carrier of the virus, or have been quarantined or are residents of a COVID-19 hotspot. As for employers and recruitment platforms, they are barred from including any discriminatory information in their listings.
Although employers have the right to check workers' health code, the results of COVID-19 tests are part of an individual's personal information, so employers and potential recruiters would be violating the law on personal information protection if they demand to see the test results of workers and job seekers.
The medical records of recovered patients are part of their personal information, which is protected by the Personal Information Protection Law. And the leakage or illegal use of such information is a violation of the law. Such information can be accessed only for specific purposes. The document also makes it clear that employers have no right to check the COVID-19 test results of other people, except as part of pandemic protection and control requirements.
The discrimination against recovered COVID-19 patients can be attributed to some employers' fear and misconception about the virus.
Yet the authorities need to raise public awareness about how the virus is transmitted and quell rumors, so employers no longer treat recovered patients as potential virus carriers. They should also strengthen their oversight on nucleic acid test results and medical history protection, so as to prevent employers and human resources agencies from illegally accessing workers' COVID-19 test results.
As for the law enforcement departments, they should take measures to stop employers from violating workers' rights. And human resources departments should strengthen supervision of employers, and encourage people to report job discrimination against recovered patients.
In fact, the notice encourages recovered patients who experience discrimination in the job market to file a case in court against their employers or potential employers, and makes it clear that the latter should be held liable, and therefore compensate the employees or job-seekers, for any discrimination.
But since the low financial compensation under the existing laws cannot fully safeguard the equal employment rights of employees and job-seekers who have recovered from COVID-19, the government should increase the compensation to heighten employers' sense of responsibility.
Employees who are fired just because they have contracted the virus can seek administrative intervention for a negotiated solution, or seek arbitration to force their employers, according to the Labor Law, to pay compensation for illegally terminating the labor contract.
Job discrimination makes recovered COVID-19 patients feel like outcasts and causes financial damage to them. So it is necessary to end job discrimination and better safeguard employees' legitimate rights, in order to build a harmonious society.

Chronic diseases such as diabetes, high blood pressure are not absolute contraindications for seniors to get COVID-19 vaccination, a health official said on Wednesday.
Zheng Zhongwei, an official at the National Health Commission and head of China's vaccine development force, said some elderly people with diabetes and high blood pressure may have worries about being vaccinated, but as long as their conditions are stable, there is no issue.
However, those likely to suffer a severe allergic reaction, who are in an acute stage of chronic disease or are in the final days of their lives, should not get vaccinated, he said. Additionally, those who are acutely sick should also hold off until they are better.
Everyone else should get vaccinated as quickly as possible for their own safety, he said.
All the current Party and State leaders have been given domestic COVID-19 vaccines and heads of states and governments from more than 30 countries have also been given Chinese vaccines, he said.
They are safe and the benefit of getting vaccinated far outweighs the risks, Zheng said.
He said that, based on the more than 1.3 billion people who have been vaccinated to date in China, side effects are similar to those of other vaccines, and the elderly face a slightly lower risk of experiencing side effects than the young.",VACCINES (96%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); CHRONIC DISEASES (90%); DIABETES (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); SENIOR CITIZENS (90%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (90%); SAFETY (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (77%); DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY (73%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (73%); BIOLOGICS MFG (71%); ALLERGIES (70%)

Before Jiang Daping had to rest at home on Thursday after developing COVID-19 symptoms that included high fever, fatigue and body aches, she had worked relentlessly for nearly three weeks.
Jiang, 44, a doctor at the village clinic in Xiawa, Xihe township, Shulan city, Jilin province, tested positive for the virus the day before.
""I began to show some mild symptoms on Tuesday, but there are only three doctors at the clinic who are responsible for providing medical services for more than 900 villagers,"" she said. ""Therefore, we can only take a break when our symptoms become serious.""
Jiang said most of the villagers are seniors and children, with the others earning a living in urban areas.
""Early this month, when the government introduced the optimized COVID-19 control policy, we issued notices to the villagers, urging them to prepare fever and cough drugs,"" she said. ""Asymptomatic cases and patients with mild symptoms are advised to recuperate at home, avoid going out, and limit contact with their families. Patients with more serious symptoms should call the emergency medical number, 120.
""We also prepared drugs and antigen test kits at the clinic, but initially faced a shortage of supplies. We tried various ways to obtain drugs, including asking for help from the township hospital and clinics in other villages, as well as contacting drug suppliers.
""To date, about 20 percent of villagers have been infected. The number began to rise after college students returned from other regions.""
Every day, doctors at the clinic receive some 15 villagers, giving them drugs or transfusions, according to their symptoms.
Doctors have also embraced online medical services to offer guidance to villagers via phones and WeChat groups.
Jiang said: ""In March, we carried out thorough investigations of each villager, recording their health information, especially for key groups such as the elderly with chronic diseases, pregnant women and seniors living alone. With the health condition database we established, we can easily give treatment once they become infected.""
""As 2023 and Spring Festival are coming, more villagers will return from outside areas, which may increase the risk of the virus spreading.
""We will focus on recording people's information, and remind them to monitor their health, wear face masks, and reduce contact with elderly family members, especially those with underlying conditions.
""Even though both occasions are very important for Chinese, we hope villagers can avoid unnecessary gatherings during this period. With the experience of fighting the pandemic over the past three years, we are confident of winning the fight.""",COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); SENIOR CITIZENS (89%); FAMILY (88%); HEALTH CARE INFORMATION (78%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (78%); NEGATIVE NEWS (77%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (77%); SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS (77%); VULNERABLE ADULTS (77%); VULNERABLE HEALTH POPULATIONS (77%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (76%); PUBLIC HEALTH (76%); COLLEGE STUDENTS (73%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (73%); WOMEN'S HEALTH (72%); SHORTAGES (69%); PREGNANCY & CHILDBIRTH (68%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (68%); CHRONIC DISEASES (66%); TRENDS & EVENTS (61%)

With the resurgence of COVID-19 cases in Dalian, Liaoning province, medical workers in the city are standing fast at their posts to block the virus.
Since Aug 20, 392 medical workers were assigned to the municipal public health clinic, which is also a COVID-19 treatment center in Liaoning province. Another 160 medical workers have been assigned to quarantine hospitals and 297 to quarantine hotels, according to local health authorities.
Infections have been rising in Dalian since Aug 28, and the city's COVID-19 prevention and control headquarters announced restrictive measures, including a work-at-home order and calls to avoid unnecessary trips to curb the spread of the virus in downtown districts.
Since then, the number of emergency calls to the city's emergency center has increased from less than 1,000 to more than 3,000.
To ensure the rescue of critically ill patients during the period, major hospitals have established emergency plans. Most medical institutions in Dalian have opened online services.
On Monday, Dalian reported two confirmed COVID-19 cases and 85 asymptomatic carriers, the city's COVID-19 prevention and control headquarters said on Tuesday.

Authorities on Thursday issued a guideline to help COVID-19 patients who exhibit mild symptoms such as fever and cough recover at home.
The guideline's release came a day after the State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism made centralized treatment of positive cases voluntary.
COVID-19 patients with serious heart, liver, lung and brain illnesses that necessitate hospitalization may not recover at home, according to the new rules.
If conditions allow, homebound patients are advised to stay in separate rooms and use their own bathrooms, and they should be supplied with a thermometer, tissues, surgical masks, single-use gloves, sanitizers and a trash can with a lid, the guideline said.
Neighborhood authorities and grassroots clinics will get in touch with isolated residents. They must keep track of vulnerable groups, such as seniors who live alone, pregnant women or people who need blood dialysis, and give advice on the use of medications and test kits, the guideline said.
Patients need to take their body temperatures in the morning and at night daily and avoid using antibacterial drugs.
They should not venture out of their homes unnecessarily. However, those suffering breathing difficulties, persistent fever or other serious health problems can call for an ambulance or drive to hospitals. If there is a need to go out, they should avoid using public transportation.
Neighborhood authorities are obligated to help those with worsening conditions be hospitalized.
Hospitals must admit these patients and cannot use any excuse to refuse them, it added.

Several Chinese regions released detailed measures recently to help tourists return home after being stranded by COVID-19 outbreaks.
On Saturday, 25 tourists who had been stranded in Datong, Shanxi province, packed their suitcases and took minibuses to the Inner Mongolia autonomous region and Shandong province.
They were the first people to be sent back home during the static management period in Datong. A notice from the city's COVID-19 epidemic prevention and control headquarters earlier this month said that people stranded in low-risk areas and who have a negative nucleic acid test result within 48 hours can apply to leave the city, once they obtain a letter of acceptance from their destination, either from their company or community.
The local government and police will direct them to railway stations, airports or roads.
The headquarters also said the lodging expenses of people stranded in the city will be paid by the local government.
On Oct 30, Hohhot, Inner Mongolia, released a notice saying that those stranded in low-risk areas and who have tested negative three times five days before leaving the city can travel.
As of Nov 2, Hohhot's online platform had received 15,684 applications and approved 3,227 exits. Because Hohhot has not resumed its domestic flights and trains, stranded people can leave from surrounding cities, local authorities said.
The epidemic prevention and control headquarters of the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region organized a conference on Oct 30 to discuss measures to help stranded students, tourists and workers return home, if it can be done without spreading the coronavirus.
Tourists who were about to leave Altay prefecture in Xinjiang told People's Daily Health on Sunday that local doctors and volunteers helped them a lot, and they wanted to come to visit again.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (72%); VIRUSES (72%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (68%); VOLUNTEERS (63%); PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS (50%)

Dradul, executive deputy mayor of Lhasa, the capital city of the Tibet autonomous region, apologized to the public for the city not performing well in its work regarding the COVID-19 prevention and controls in a news briefing on Saturday.
During the briefing, Dradul acknowledged the deficiencies of the government's work in the preparation, handling, response and implementation regarding its COVID-19 prevention measures and policies.
""For example, how the inadequate nucleic acid testing capabilities at the early stages of the outbreak led to an inadequate follow-up of nucleic acid screening in some communities, and the feedback of testing results was delayed, and the inaccurate of some testing results,"" said Dradul.
Dradul also said many residents, who share public toilets and the same drinking water points from large compounds in Lhasa, were transferred to places favourable for epidemic prevention and control, and to avoid possible cross-infection.
""Due to emergency, the residents were not given the explanation of the transferring in advance,"" added Dradul.
The insufficiencies also include the poor management of some makeshift hospitals, as these temporary hospitals were set up immediately to treat the patients. Meanwhile, some of the temporary hospitals were unqualified in logistic support, they had problems such as untimely cleaning and waste disposal.
""On behalf of the city's government, I would like to express my deep apologies to all the people of the city and those who got stranded in Lhasa due to the pandemic,"" said Dradul, adding that the city's government will directly face all challenges, and improve the deficiencies to further optimize its epidemic prevention and control measures.

Shanghai will strengthen health checks for inbound travelers, teachers, and students after the city reported a new local asymptomatic COVID-19 case on Wednesday, a week ahead of the start of the school term.
The new case, involving a 43-year-old man who had traveled outside Shanghai, was found in Kangqiao township, Pudong district.
The man returned to Shanghai on Sunday, and tested positive on Tuesday.
A total of 43 close contacts and 16 secondary contacts have been identified and quarantined.
And the neighborhood in which the infection was identified has been locked down while testing is carried out.
Zhao Dandan, deputy director of the Shanghai Health Commission, said the city will step up regular health checks at airports, railway stations, and bus terminals, as well as in hotels and residential communities.
""The epidemic control and prevention faces pressure as the traffic in and out of the city has increased during the summer break,"" Zhao said.
Inbound travelers to Shanghai from epidemic hotspots will be required to undergo seven-day centralized quarantines, while those with travel histories from medium-level risk areas will be required to undergo seven days of home quarantine, Zhao said.
Yan Bo, vice-governor of Pudong, said around 620,000 students and teachers will return to the classroom on Sept 1.
Before the semester begins, schools will have to contact students and teachers and ask for their travel histories and health status. Each person will also need to conduct 14 days of self-monitoring, and take two nucleic acid tests within three days before they will be allowed onto school sites, Yan said.
Yan added that each school has set up a testing station, and the district has designated eight testing facilities that will be sued to analyze samples from schools.

Chinese people have borne the minimum influence of the COVID-19 epidemic in terms of possibility of infection and mortality, said a senior official.
Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said at a news conference on Thursday, in Beijing, that though other nations in the world have been affected by the COVID-19 epidemic in past three years, Chinese people have received minimum influence in comparison.
He cited figures from the World Health Organization that as of Monday, the United States has reported 95,260,865 confirmed cases, among which 1,050,195 died from the novel coronavirus. However, the Chinese mainland reported 1,009,114 cases, including confirmed and asymptomatic, with the death toll of about 5,226.
""That means 70 people out of every 100,000 people in the Chinese mainland got infected by the COVID-19, with the infection rate about 1/483 of that in the US. The death rate due to COVID-19 is 0.4 people out of every 100,000 in the Chinese mainland, making it 1/785 of that in the US,"" he said.
He also compared China's infection and death rates with global numbers.
""The Chinese population takes up 18.32 percent of the world's total population, but the infection cases contribute to 0.16 percent of the world's total number,"" he added. ""If we calculate the infection rate by every 100,000 people, the infection rate in the Chinese mainland is 1/112 of the world's total number and the death rate is 1/229 of the world's figures.""

China will cut COVID-19 quarantine period for incoming travelers from 10 to 8 days, cancel the circuit breaker for inbound flights and no longer determine secondary close contacts of confirmed cases, health authorities said on Friday.
Categories of COVID-risk areas will be adjusted to high and low, from the old tertiary standards of high, medium and low, according to a notice that lays out 20 measures aimed at upgrading disease control measures.
According to the notice released by the State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism, international travelers will undergo five days of centralized quarantine plus three days of home-based isolation, compared with the current rule of seven days of centralized isolation plus three days spent at home.
It also stipulates that inbound travelers should not be put into isolation again after finishing the required quarantine period at their first points of entry.
The circuit-breaker mechanism, which bans flight routes if inbound international flights carry COVID-10 cases, will be canceled. Inbound travelers will only need to provide one, rather than two, negative nucleic acid testing results taken 48 hours before boarding.
Quarantine periods for close contacts of confirmed infections have also been reduced from 10 to 8 days, while secondary close contacts will no longer be traced.
The notice said that modifying categories of COVID-risk areas is aimed at minimizing the number of people facing travel restrictions.
High-risk areas, it said, will cover residences of infected cases and places where they frequently visit and are at high risk of the virus's spread. The designation of high-risk areas should be bound to a certain building unit and should not be expanded recklessly. If no new cases are detected for five consecutive days, the high-risk label along with control measures should be lifted promptly.
The notice also requires ramping up stockpiles of COVID-19 drugs and medical equipment, preparing more intensive care unit beds, bolstering booster vaccination rates especially among the elderly and accelerating research of broad-spectrum and multivalent vaccines.
It also vows to heighten crackdown on malpractices such as adopting one-size-fits-all policies or imposing additional curbs, as well as stepping up care for vulnerable groups and stranded groups amid a local outbreak.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); ISOLATION & QUARANTINE (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); DISEASE REPORTING (89%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (89%); VACCINES (89%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); LEVELS OF CARE (77%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (75%); VULNERABLE ADULTS (75%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (72%); SENIOR CITIZENS (71%); INTENSIVE CARE UNITS (70%); VULNERABLE HEALTH POPULATIONS (65%)

People recovering from COVID-19 suffer from increased rates of brain fog and dementia, according to the largest study of its kind, which was published on Thursday.
The research suggests such neurological and psychiatric conditions remain more common for as long as two years after a COVID-19 infection, compared with other respiratory infections.
Researchers also found an increased risk of anxiety and depression, but noted that this subsides to rates in line with other respiratory diseases within two months of contracting COVID-19.
The study, published in The Lancet Psychiatry journal, analyzed data on 14 neurological and psychiatric diagnoses gathered from more than a million patient health records, mostly in the United States, during a two-year period, reported Sky News.
Max Taquet of the department of psychiatry at the University of Oxford, one of the study authors, said the finding that the excess risk of depression and anxiety disorders disappeared within two months was ""very reassuring indeed"". Speaking during a news briefing, he said: ""The more worrying news is that other disorders including brain fog, dementia, psychotic disorders, and epilepsy and seizures remain elevated, with more new cases still being newly diagnosed two years after COVID-19 infection.""
The researchers cautioned that the study also likely under-represented people with mild or asymptomatic COVID-19, and in some cases vaccination status may have been unrecorded.
The study sought ""to pull out what COVID, as the virus, does to you specifically, versus what other viruses affecting the same part of your body in a generally similar fashion might be doing,"" said lead author Paul Harrison. ""The results have important implications for patients and health services as it suggests new cases of neurological conditions linked to COVID-19 infection are likely to occur for a considerable time after the pandemic has subsided.""
The study's results add to a growing body of research identifying long-lasting damage caused by the novel coronavirus. Such symptoms, known as ""long COVID,"" include both neurological problems as well as fatigue and shortness of breath.
Taquet said: ""The findings shed new light on the longer-term mental and brain health consequences for people following COVID-19 infection. The results have implications for patients and health services and highlight the need for more research to understand why this happens after COVID-19, and what can be done to prevent these disorders from occurring, or treat them when they do.""

The COVID-19 is still rampaging unchecked in the US as no public health measures are in place to protect people adequately from being infected, an infectious disease expert says.
""The elderly, the immunocompromised, and other vulnerable populations remain at risk of severe infection,"" wrote William A. Haseltine in an article published on the Project Syndicate website on June 10. Haseltine is chair and president of the global health think tank ACCESS Health International.
The needs of the vulnerable people have been forgotten, he said. The main treatment options currently for the people who get infected and are at risk for long-term effects and disability still cannot be put into wider use because they all have limitations.
Vaccination alone is not sufficient to protect people from being re-infected with COVID-19, he added. More than one-third COVID-19 patients will develop long-term symptoms of some kind, and two to four percent will experience severe consequences that would make them ill for many months, even years.

China's move to downgrade the management of COVID-19 from category A to category B - a major adjustment to China's epidemic control policy - was well-timed, a senior health official said.
Li Bin, vice-minister of the National Health Commission, said at a news conference on Tuesday that since placing the management of COVID-19 in category A in 2020, the country has withstood five waves of the epidemic and has helped its people avoid being infected by stronger variants of the virus. It has also bought time for China to prepare its medical resources.
""By evaluating factors including viral mutations, epidemic situations and disease control capability, China has met the basic requirements for downgrading management. The decision was made because we are ready,"" Li said.
The dominant Omicron strain is highly infectious, but the rates of severe illnesses and deaths are extremely low. Also, China has distributed over 3.4 billion COVID-19 doses and has fully vaccinated more than 92 percent of people age 3 and above, he added.
The adjustment is aimed at controlling outbreaks more precisely and scientifically, and at making more efficient use of resources to balance epidemic containment and socioeconomic development, Li said.

Officials in Chengde, Hebei province apologized on Tuesday for a notice threatening excessive consequences for those who don't cooperate with efforts in controlling the COVID-19 epidemic, according to a statement by local authorities.
The notice, quickly retracted, was released by the Office of Command for the Prevention and Control of COVID-19 Epidemic in the Chengde High-tech Industrial Development Zone.
It alleged those who deliberately conceal travel and refuse to cooperate with epidemiological investigations will face grave consequences, including bearing medical expenses themselves if confirmed as infected with COVID-19 and proven to have been dishonest.
""We apologize for the distress caused by the notice,"" the statement by the zone's government read, adding further investigation is underway and those responsible will be punished according to the law.
The statement said the measures mentioned in the notice had been issued without approval, and there was insufficient foundation in terms of laws and national guidelines, thus the notice would be revoked.
The notice led to heated discussion online. It claimed if the persons responsible are relatives of Party members or government officials, they will bear joint responsibility for failure to manage and advise their relatives well.
If they are entrepreneurs, the notice said they will be put onto a blacklist of banks and will be not allowed to apply for several types of loans.
If they are ordinary private citizens, the notice added they will be punished for dishonest behavior, meaning they and their collateral relatives up to three generations will be forbidden from joining the army or the Communist Party of China, or applying for jobs as civil servants. They can only be removed from the list if they maintain a clean record for three years.

The 20 adjusted COVID-19 control measures released by the State Council's Joint Prevention and Control Mechanism on Nov 11 strictly forbid imposing arbitrary COVID-19 restrictions such as locking down schools, halting production, suspending transportation without approval and prolonged lockdowns. A series of laws, regulations and guidelines have clarified the requirements. The following Q&A is compiled to provide greater clarity around the new measures.
Q: Who has the power to implement lockdowns?
A: Local governments at and above the county level can enforce lockdowns, according to China's Law on the Prevention and Treatment of Infectious Diseases.
The law stipulates that governments at and above the county level should organize resources to cut transmission of contagious diseases when an outbreak occurs. If necessary, they should report to upper-level authorities to determine the rollout of a series of emergency measures, such as suspending markets, art performances and other gatherings; halting production; and closing down schools and venues that might cause further spread of the virus.
The Regulations on Emergency Response to Acute Public Health Events also requires health departments of governments at and above the county level to lead in the management of health emergencies and the provision of treatment.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (88%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (78%); PREVENTION & WELLNESS (77%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (77%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (76%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (76%); MEDICAL TREATMENTS & PROCEDURES (74%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (74%); LAW & LEGAL SYSTEM (71%)

Growing reports of people experiencing a COVID-19 rebound after taking the antiviral treatment Paxlovid have ""refreshed our understanding of the novel coronavirus"", a senior Chinese public health expert said on Monday.
The phenomenon suggests that COVID-19 antiviral drugs work by inhibiting the novel coronavirus' replication, rather than killing the virus in an infected patient-employing the same method as medications against HIV, Wu Zunyou, chief epidemiologist at the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said on his Sina Weibo social media account.
While stressing that Paxlovid, made by United States' pharmaceutical giant Pfizer, is one of just a handful of effective therapies available at present, Wu said recent rebound cases should serve as a reminder that the development of COVID-19 drugs remains an arduous task.
A COVID-19 rebound is characterized by a recurrence of symptoms or a new positive viral test after having tested negative, according to a health advisory issued by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
A review of clinical trial data submitted by Pfizer showed that 1 to 2 percent of patients had infection rebounds after completing treatment, the US Food and Drug Administration said in May.
One self-reported case in particular attracted the attention of Wu and other health experts around the globe.
David Ho, a renowned virologist at Columbia University who pioneered the discovery of cocktail therapy against HIV/AIDS, said during an interview with Time magazine in May that he tested positive again after taking a five-day course of Paxlovid and having tested negative at least six times.
By using his lab at Columbia University, Ho was able to carefully track his infection and to genome sequence the virus.
""What Ho found is that the second round of positive COVID-19 infection is not because the virus has developed resistance to the drug or mutated. Nor was he infected with another strain of the virus,"" Wu said. ""Instead, it was caused by a 'resurrection' or 'rebound' of the initial infection.""
In a case report released on May 23 on Research Square, a preprint platform, Ho looked into 10 rebound cases, including his own. The report was published by researchers from several institutions in the US.
""Two of the 10 cases had transmitted the virus to others when their infections recurred, suggesting their contagiousness was not low,"" he said, adding that relapsed cases tested negative without further treatment in about three to five days.
Based on its findings, the report suggested patients who have symptomatic relapse following Paxlovid treatment should isolate until antigen testing is negative.
Wu said a COVID-19 rebound after treatment is similar to some cases observed in HIV patients.
Current HIV drugs aim at blocking the virus' replication and suppressing the viral load in a patient below the detectable threshold. But the virus will rebound after suspending treatment and HIV patients need to take medications for life, according to Wu.
""The phenomenon has refreshed our view of the novel coronavirus and made us realize that COVID-19 drugs might not be as convenient as we've imagined and there is a long and strenuous way ahead,"" he said.
Wu noted that the benefits of COVID-19 antiviral drugs outweigh the risks and Paxlovid can still be used as an effective drug against the disease.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (93%); AIDS & HIV (90%); AIDS & HIV TREATMENT (90%); CLINICAL TRIALS (90%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (90%); VIRUSES (90%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (78%); INTERVIEWS (78%); MICROBIOLOGY (78%); VIROLOGY (77%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (74%); RESEARCH REPORTS (73%); SOCIAL MEDIA (70%)

Haizhu district, the epicenter of this round of COVID-19 outbreak in Guangzhou, Guangdong province, has further strengthened its prevention and control measures starting Friday.
According to the new measures that will last until the end of Sunday, all the residents in the district are required to stay at home unless absolutely necessary to limit the flow of people.
Only one person from each household is allowed to go out for shopping each day, said a statement released by the district government on Friday.
All public transport services, including bus, metro, taxi and online car hailing, have been suspended while major highway entrances to Haizhu have also been temporarily closed, said the statement.
And closed-loop management has been introduced in all the colleges, and major companies and institutions, including elderly homes and confinement centers of parturients, it said, adding that all business premises, except hospitals, clinics, pharmacies and some supermarkets that ensure the supplies of people's livelihood, have been temporarily be closed.
Meanwhile a new round of nucleic acid testing campaign has been launched to help seek the possible infections and block the spread of the virus in local communities, said the statement.
Haizhu, where the exhibition halls of China Import and Export Fair are located, is a major international exhibition and convention center in the southern Chinese region and a densely populated area in Guangzhou, which has a population of more than 18 million.
In addition to Haizhu, the districts of Yuexiu, Liwan, Panyu and Baiyun have also further tightened their measures against COVID-19 beginning Friday.
And many universities and colleges in the city have introduced closed-loop management and launched online classes starting Friday.
The new measures were introduced when Guangzhou reported 225 local transmitted patients and 2,358 asymptomatic carriers on Thursday. And the whole Guangdong province reported a total of 289 confirmed patients, and 2,461 asymptomatic carriers, on Thursday, according to statistics released by the Guangdong Provincial Health Commission on Friday.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); DISTANCE LEARNING (78%); POPULATION DENSITY (78%); VIRTUAL EVENTS (78%); CITY LIFE (74%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (72%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (72%); EXPORT TRADE (70%); IMPORT TRADE (70%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (68%); STATISTICS (62%)

Thailand's lifting of almost all its COVID-19 travel restrictions on Friday is conducive to economic recovery, but new concerns have arisen on its plan to declare a ""post-pandemic era"" in the country, experts said.
Foreign tourists can now visit Thailand without registering for the Thailand Pass, an entry program that was introduced during the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the Tourism Authority of Thailand.
This means that all travelers can enter Thailand with just proof of either a vaccination certificate or a pre-arrival negative test result.
The Southeast Asian country removed all key travel restrictions from Friday and had originally planned to declare COVID-19 endemic on the same day. But the Thai Ministry of Public Health said it will postpone the plan for another week as it needs to monitor the domestic COVID-19 situation.
New COVID-19 treatment rules, effective from Friday, will allow patients to receive free treatment at registered hospitals based on their medical benefits and coverage, the Thai government said.
The announcement came as Thailand's Center for COVID-19 Situation Administration, or CCSA, reported a steep spike in lung infections among COVID-19 patients, jumping to 684 cases on June 30 from 598 on June 17, reported the Bangkok Post.
CCSA assistant spokeswoman Apisamai Srirangsan said the fatality rate remained stable and the increase was expected since Thailand had already made mask-wearing optional.
Manoon Leechawengwongs, a pulmonologist at Vichaiyut Hospital in Bangkok, said the government should postpone its plan to declare Thailand in the post-pandemic era as the private hospital saw increasing numbers of new patients, a trend that has been seen in all hospitals in Bangkok.
Thailand reported 2,354 new cases on Friday, bringing the national tally to 4,525,269. The virus has caused 30,664 deaths in the country so far.
As of Wednesday, Thailand has administered 140 million COVID-19 vaccine doses, according to the CCSA. Yet, only 42.6 percent of its 70 million population received the booster shot－well below the national target of 60 percent.
'Not ready'
Thailand is ""not ready"" to declare its post-pandemic status, said Thira Woratanarat, an associate professor at Chulalongkorn University's Faculty of Medicine in Bangkok.
Thira told China Daily that COVID-19 is a rapidly evolving virus and it is difficult to predict its pace and pattern. He said current public surveillance data cannot show the actual infection situation and will cause misperception among Thai people.
""If the Thai Ministry of Public Health announces the post-pandemic entry without readiness, it is highly possible that the epidemic will be going on without a trustable surveillance system,"" Thira said.
Thira also said he is most concerned about the long-term sequelae of COVID-19 infections that would impair Thai people's abilities for daily activities.
Noting Thailand has detected new COVID-19 subvariants BA.4 and BA.5, Thira said BA.5 will take over the pandemic in Thailand. ""Around one-fifth of countries with the BA.5 wave showed a higher peak than earlier waves,"" he said.
Thira said the health authorities should strengthen the surveillance system and regularly update the situation to the public.
Jesper Palmqvist, area director for Asia-Pacific at data and consulting company STR, told China Daily that easing entry rules will help improve Thailand's tourism prospects, but the recovery is still in its early days.
Thailand received nearly 40 million international tourists in 2019, with about a quarter of them from China. The country has so far recorded more than 2 million arrivals this year and is aiming to receive up to 10 million foreign tourist arrivals in total.
Though Thailand has been trying to diversify its source markets even before the pandemic, Palmqvist said it will take years to get it going properly.

The authorities of Guangzhou, Guangdong province have pledged to meet various medical care demands from residents as the COVID-19 control measures are optimised to be more precise and scientific.
A total of 1,323 general nucleic acid test sampling spots, 297 sampling spots for people with a yellow health code and 87 24-hour sampling spots are in place across the city on Friday, said Zhang Yi, deputy director of Guangzhou Health Commission, at a news conference on Friday.
Out-patients can enter hospitals with a green health codes and new in-patients and their companions are required to present a negative nucleic acid test result within 24 hours to enter hospitals in the city.
All qualified fever clinics are required to open, with the staff at those clinics strengthened.
Medical resource reserves are planned, including designated hospitals and makeshift hospitals for admitting infected people.
These hospitals in the city have nearly 90,000 beds and more than 2,000 ICU beds.
Guangzhou has reported about 162,700 infection cases in the ongoing outbreak, with asymptomatic carriers accounting for about 90 percent of them. Only four patients suffer severe or critical conditions, with no death cases.
This indicates significantly lower pathogenicity of the current Omicron subvariant of the virus, Zhang said.
As COVID-19 control measures are adjusted in the city, the demand for related medicines have surged.
On Thursday, 100,000 records of sale of flu and fever medicines were booked at retail pharmacies in the city, which was 2.5 times the amount in a normal day, said Ding Li, deputy director of the Guangzhou Administration for Market Regulation.
The authorities have contacted wholesale and retail medicine companies in the city for greater procurement and coordinated medicine and medical device producing companies in the city for reasonably greater supply.
The city's daily capacity of producing antigen test kits stands at 10.5 million units.
The authorities are scrutinising the quality and prices of medicines, Ding said, also reminding the public of safe use of medicines and expiration of medicines.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (89%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH & WELFARE LAW (76%); INTENSIVE CARE UNITS (75%); MEDICAL DEVICES (73%); PRESS CONFERENCES (73%); INFLUENZA (71%); PRICES (69%); DRUG PRICES (64%)

Beijing announced on Saturday more measures, mainly concerning medical services to provide more convenience for the public, during the ongoing COVID-19 outbreak.
Starting on Saturday, residents in the city will no longer need to register their personal information for purchasing medicines for a fever, cough, sore throat or anti-infection both online or in drugstores, according to the municipality's market supervision authority.
People can also get healthcare and medical consultant service at an online platform relaunched recently by Beijing Medical Association which has arranged experts on eight specialties including respiratory, infectious diseases, geriatrics, pediatrics and psychology, according to the city's health commission on Saturday.
""The platform will run between 8 am and 10 pm and experts will answer the questions from the public during the time, which will help people get professional guidance and medical knowledge without going out,"" said the commission.
The platform, held by the Beijing Medical Association and guided by the government, was first launched on Feb 1, 2020. On April 28 this year, it was put into operation again due to the epidemic outbreak during the time. People can log onto the platform via Wechat.
The health commission also announced on Saturday the city will improve the service in makeshift hospitals to ensure that patients can be discharged safely, effectively and orderly.
The staff of makeshift hospitals will provide documents for recovered patients to ensure the latter can be accepted by their residential communities smoothly. The communities' health service agencies will be responsible for discharged patients' registration and provide health guidance afterwards.
On Saturday morning, Beijing's top epidemic control and prevention work group held a meeting hosted by the capital's Party chief Yin Li, saying that the city's epidemic control and prevention situation is still severe and complicated. All stakeholders including the individual should work more scientifically and effectively to curb the upward trend of the ongoing outbreak and avoid new epidemics.

Pioneers of the research that led to one of the first COVID-19 vaccines say breakthroughs made in their studies could point the way toward developing a potential vaccine against cancer before the end of the decade.
In a BBC interview, husband and wife team Ugur Sahin and Ozlem Tureci, co-founders of BioNTech, the German company that teamed up with pharmaceutical giant Pfizer to create one of the game-changing vaccines, said technology they had developed could be repurposed to help the immune system respond to cancer cells.
The mRNA COVID-19 vaccine causes cells to create spike proteins, which warn the body's immune system about things to look out for and to attack. It is hoped that this could be reworked using proteins found in cancer tumor cells, causing a similar bodily defensive action.
BioNTech was founded in 2008 specifically to work on cancer treatments. ""From the very beginning, our focus has always been on exploiting the full potential of the body's immune system to successfully help address cancer and infectious diseases,"" says the company website.
The pandemic diverted its efforts, but now the focus has shifted away from it, some of those earlier cancer vaccine developments have reached the clinical trial stage.
""As scientists we are always hesitant to say we will have a cure for cancer,"" said Tureci. ""We have a number of breakthroughs and we will continue to work on them ... this will definitely accelerate also our cancer vaccine.""
Luke O'Neill, professor of biochemistry at Trinity College Dublin, told Irish state broadcaster RTE that such a breakthrough would be ""the Holy Grail"" of cancer research.
""There's at least 10 clinical trials running at the moment using RNA vaccines on cancer, and they're obviously early stage trials. But it seems like pancreatic, melanoma, head and neck cancer, the really difficult ones, are the ones they're going after first and the signs are they are seeing some traction here,"" he said. ""I guess the way to put it is that optimism has never been higher.""
He added that ""the dream"" was for a way to be found to enable the body to recognize a cancer tumor as a foreign element, in the same way it had done with COVID-19, and to respond accordingly, so that the immune system could be ""trained"" to ""hunt down ""the rogue presence.
""You're training the immune system like a smart bomb, in a way, to see those differences and kill that tumor cell,"" he continued.
What made the potential breakthrough even more exciting, he said, was that any treatment could be personalized to work on an individual cancer patient's specific circumstances.
""You can take someone who's got cancer, take their own tumor and make an RNA vaccine out of that and soup up their own immune system specifically against their own tumor. That's a really wonderful thing to see,"" he added.","CANCER (95%); VACCINES (94%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); IMMUNOLOGY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); MEDICAL TREATMENTS & PROCEDURES (90%); ONCOLOGY (90%); CANCER DRUGS (89%); TUMORS (89%); BIOCHEMICAL RESEARCH (78%); HEAD & NECK CANCER (78%); MEDICAL RESEARCH (78%); DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY (77%); EPIDEMICS (77%); GENETIC BIOCHEMISTRY (75%); INTERVIEWS (73%); SKIN CANCER (73%); BIOCHEMISTRY (69%); BOMBS & EXPLOSIVE DEVICES (68%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (50%)

SHANGHAI - Huang Huiqin, 108, is in good health six months after she recovered from COVID-19 in Shanghai.
In a recent return visit by phone, doctors with the Ruijin Hospital Luwan Branch, where Huang was treated in May, determined that her underlying issues remain stable, with no sequelae caused by the virus found. They gave the centenarian blessings and health guidance.
After testing positive for the virus on May 16, Huang was transferred to the hospital for treatment.
Huang had been in bed after experiencing a bad fall 18 months prior, and was incontinent with contracted lower limbs. It was not an easy task to treat the elderly patient.
Medics who traveled from Hunan and Shanxi provinces to assist the city's fight against the epidemic and the hospital staff established a special medical team to implement personalized therapeutic solutions for Huang.
The nurses on her ward continuously provided her with prone-position ventilation support, improved her lung ventilation status, and kept her oxygen saturation level above 97 percent at all times, thus helping the patient survive her most dangerous period of acute infection.
Every day, the medical staff also treated her pressure sores, which had been caused by her being bedridden for a long time, so she never experienced further skin damage or secondary infection during her hospitalization.
An intensive care team from the Xiangya Hospital of Central South University in Hunan made a daily inspection plan, and ICU doctors and respiratory therapists visited her on a daily basis to determine potential risk factors, thus ensuring the normal workings of her vital organ functions.
Strictly implementing the requirements of the national COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment plan, identifying potential risks in a timely manner and addressing any such risks are key to treating elderly patients, said Kang Yan, director of the critical care medicine department at the West China Hospital of Sichuan University. Kang had given advice on the treatment of Huang.

Strengthened measures including the suspension of classes for students and reduction of flow of people were introduced on Sunday in Haizhu district of Guangzhou, the capital of Guangdong province, to further prevent and control the new round of the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the district's areas, except the Pazhou subdistrict, the local authorities have suspended the nonessential flow of people, advocating for the people of government agencies and institutions to work from home and enterprises without urban security missions stop operating, according to Fu Xiaochu, executive deputy head of Haizhu.
In a press conference held on Sunday, Fu said offline classes for students in the district would be continuously suspended in the week ahead.
""The measures are aimed to stop the transmission of the virus as soon as possible in local communities, especially in those urban villages,"" he said.

The United Kingdom has become the first nation to approve a COVID-19 vaccine from United States biotechnology company Moderna that targets both the original form of the virus and the Omicron variant.
The UK Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, or MHRA, approved the vaccine on Monday after analyzing Moderna trial data. Shortly after, UK Health Secretary Steve Barclay confirmed that the shot will be distributed during the autumn booster program.
""The rollout will include a new bivalent vaccine that will target Omicron and the original strain of COVID-19,"" Barclay wrote on Twitter.
Half of the active ingredient in the bivalent mRNA booster vaccine targets the 2020 strain of the virus, meanwhile half targets the original Omicron variant known as BA.1, which first hit the UK in January. Moderna said that the shot also proved effective at neutralizing BA.4 and BA.5, two Omicron sub-lineages that are currently the most prevalent forms of COVID-19 in the UK, making up 16 percent and 75 percent of infections respectively, according to the Office for National Statistics, or ONS.
Health authorities say the new jab will bolster the vaccine campaign against the virus, since the Omicron variant and its sub-lineages have proven the most able to escape the antibodies raised through infection or first-generation COVID-19 vaccines.
COVID-19 infections are decreasing in the UK but remain high, the ONS said in its most recent survey to the week ending July 26, when one person in 25 in England had the virus, down from one in 20 the week prior.
Moderna said that the UK is the first to approve its bivalent vaccine, and the company expects authorization decisions from regulators in Australia, Canada, and the European Union in the coming weeks. Meanwhile, US pharmaceutical company Pfizer has submitted data for its bivalent booster to regulators in the US and the EU.
Shanghai-based Clover Biopharmaceuticals is also developing a bivalent jab that demonstrated ""potent neutralization ""of both the original strain and Omicron in preclinical trials in May, the company said.
Jonathan Ball, professor of molecular virology at the University of Nottingham, said that vaccine developers will be locked in an arms race against COVID-19 for some time as the virus continues to evolve.
""The virus is unlikely to stand still and Omicron-targeted immunity might push the virus down other evolutionary paths, in which case we will be like the Red Queen in Alice and the Looking Glass-having to keep running just to stay in the same place,"" Ball said.
""That said, unless there is a major shift in the virus, immunity will continue to protect the vast majority from serious disease caused by emerging variants.""","COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (96%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (95%); VACCINES (93%); APPROVALS (90%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY (78%); EUROPEAN UNION (78%); MICROBIOLOGY (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); VIRUSES (78%); WEAPONS & ARMS (77%); HEALTH CARE POLICY (76%); STATISTICS (76%); BIOTECHNOLOGY & GENETIC SCIENCE (73%); VIROLOGY (73%); BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY (72%); POLLS & SURVEYS (72%); HEALTH CARE LAW (71%); GOVERNMENT STATISTICS AGENCIES (66%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (63%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (50%)

""We ran out of Ibuprofen yesterday. Supplies of alternative drugs are also running low,"" Liu said on Thursday. ""We contacted seven pharmaceutical companies, but failed to replenish our stocks.""
There are more than 40 workers at the central hospital in Xiaoshajiang township, Longhui county, Hunan, including a dozen doctors. They serve the entire township, which boasts 14 villages with a total population of 26,000.
Liu said the health workers see more than 20 fever patients every day, and the number is continuing to rise.
The patients are now treated with other remedies for colds, physical cooling, and traditional Chinese medicine, as well as being given emergency intramuscular antipyretic drugs.
Liu said: ""We have a limited number of medical staff. Many doctors have not had a break for a month or two. Even though more than 10 workers tested positive for COVID-19, some of them, including the deputy director, continue to work instead of taking a rest.""
The condition of patients is seldom so severe that they need to be hospitalized, and Liu said the inpatient unit is now free from infections.
The hospital is about 1,350 meters above sea level, and the temperature is about 6 or 7 degrees Celsius lower than that in the county town, which is about 90 kilometers away.
""For critically ill patients, their condition might be more severe than for those living in low-altitude areas,"" Liu said, adding that more attention is being paid to prevent such cases emerging after infection, especially among those with underlying medical conditions, the elderly and infants.
Liu said there is a medical team for each village. For many years, these workers have made regular home visits to patients - mainly those with conditions such as diabetes, tuberculosis, psychosis and hypertension.
These teams now also provide health monitoring and consultation services based on patients' needs, deliver medicine to them, and provide guidance.
""These patients will be hospitalized if we find their condition is severe. In addition, we will prepare for them to be transferred immediately to hospitals in the county town, where there are better medical conditions,"" Liu said.
In the past two weeks, five patients have been transferred to hospitals in the county town.
Liu expects the biggest near-term pressure to come during Spring Festival next month, when people working outside the area return home for family reunions.
Many residents from Longhui county are migrant workers in factories in the Pearl River Delta, including most of the young people from Xiaoshajiang township, who account for about one-third of the town's population.
""With such a large number of people returning home, we're preparing for a spike in infections,"" Liu said.
Health monitoring guidance for families with vulnerable members is being stepped up to reduce the number of critically ill patients.
""In particular, we need to prevent medical staff members from being unable to work if they become infected at the same time, and reserve more staff,"" Liu said.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (89%); COMMON COLD (77%); ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (76%); BLUE COLLAR WORKERS (75%); FACTORY WORKERS (70%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (70%); MIGRANT WORKERS (70%); FAMILY (69%); CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (68%); DIABETES (68%); TUBERCULOSIS (68%); HYPERTENSION (67%)

Beijing saw a jump in COVID-19 cases over the weekend as Haidian district joined four others to require people to work from home in order to curb the epidemic.
The city reported 94 new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases between 3 pm on Saturday and 3 pm on Sunday, bringing the total number of infections to 1,493 since April 22, said Liu Xiaofeng, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control.
Of the newly reported infections, 77 were reported in controlled zones, and 17 were found from mass nucleic acid testing conducted at the community level, he said at a daily news conference on Sunday.
A total of 16.25 million people participated in testing on Saturday, with 10 tube samples showing up positive for COVID-19, according to Wang Xiao'e, an official with the Beijing Health Commission.
Xu Hejian, a spokesman for the Beijing city government, said the cluster infections at the Yuegezhuang market in Fengtai district and sporadic cases found in Fengtai, Haidian and Dongcheng districts have added to the uncertainties and risks of the city's epidemic situation, which remains severe and complicated.
However, residents can rest assured that the city has enough supplies of daily necessities, while supermarkets and deliveries in controlled zones remain open to meet people's demands, he said.
Residents living in Chaoyang, Haidian, Fengtai, Fangshan and Shunyi districts should work from home from Sunday to May 28, while other districts should also lower the number of people working in offices, Xu said.
The point of working from home is staying at home, he said. Individuals and employers should make concerted efforts to implement epidemic control measures, limit people's movements and cut off transmission chains as soon as possible, he added.
Xiao Dan, director of the Party's publicity department in Haidian, said the district has tightened epidemic control measures and has asked residents to work from home since Saturday.
People in controlled areas should not leave their homes unless they are going out to take nucleic acid tests, take out trash or pick up deliveries, she said.
Supermarkets, medical institutions and drugstores are allowed to continue operating, and restaurants should only provide takeout meals, she added.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); HOME BASED EMPLOYMENT (89%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (78%); CITY GOVERNMENT (77%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (77%); PRESS CONFERENCES (73%); CITIES (72%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (52%)

Shanghai is expected to achieve zero-COVID beyond areas under closed-loop management in mid-May, and will by then ease COVID-19 restrictions while implementing a tiered management system for communities based on their risk levels, local authorities said on Friday.
According to Shanghai's Vice-Mayor Wu Qing, efforts to control the current COVID-19 wave have started to show good results. Despite small fluctuations in daily new infection numbers, over 99 percent of new infections have been identified through testing in closed-loop management zones. In the past three days, only six cases were found in other areas.
""The city now faces a critical transition from epidemic emergency response to a normalized prevention and control mode,"" Wu said.
Further efforts will be made in epidemic control and prevention in key areas, including old neighborhoods and villages at risk of a resurgence, he added.
""We're drafting an outline to consolidate the results of the prevention and control efforts so far and to prepare for the resumption of work, business and on-campus education and a return to normalcy,"" Wu said.
Cars will be allowed back on the roads gradually while supermarkets, convenience stores and other types of businesses such as hairdressing will gradually be allowed to operate.
""Students who need to sit exams, especially ninth, 11th and 12th graders in high schools, will be given priority to return to school. More healthcare institutions and government service windows will also be reopened gradually,"" he added.
Over 9,900 nucleic acid testing sites have been set up and more than 5,700 of them were operational across the city as of Thursday, mainly providing services for residents in precautionary zones and people who have resumed work, Wu said.
Shanghai reported 227 new locally transmitted COVID-19 confirmed cases, 1,869 asymptomatic infections and two deaths on Thursday. The two who died were aged 88 and 89.
""Given the large aging population that is vulnerable to the virus, vaccination acts as one of the most effective means to protect the elderly and we must promptly accelerate the vaccination of this group of people,"" said Zhao Dandan, deputy director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission.
Shanghai administered around 100,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines between May 1 and 11, with about half of these given to people aged 60 and above, according to Zhao.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); EPIDEMICS (89%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (89%); VACCINES (89%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (77%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (76%); AGING TRENDS (75%); DISEASE REPORTING (75%); DEATH & DYING (74%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (73%); SAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (73%); SENIOR CITIZENS (72%); HIGH SCHOOLS (71%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (71%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (70%); AGING (68%)"

The United Kingdom has launched a trial to test a COVID-19 treatment that can be taken in pill form at home, potentially reducing the risk of severe symptoms and hospitalizations.
The UK-wide PANORAMIC clinical trial, led by the University of Oxford, is assessing the antiviral pill Molnupiravir in 10,000 people who register for the study and go on to test positive for COVID-19.
Eligible candidates include those aged 50 years and older, and 18 to 49 year olds with underlying health conditions, or who have been unwell with COVID-19 for less than five days.
The government announced that, from Dec 16, Molnupiravir will also be made available outside the study, to people at the highest risk of severe illness, including those who are immunocompromised, cancer patients, and those with Down's Syndrome.
Previous trials have shown that Molnupiravir can reduce the risk of hospitalization or death in adults with mild to moderate COVID-19 by 30 percent.
Health Secretary Sajid Javid called the national study a ""historic milestone in our battle against the virus"", paving the way for the first medicines that people will be able to take ""in the comfort of their own homes to protect themselves"".
Chris Butler, a primary care professor at University of Oxford and chief investigator on the trial, said participants will have the drug sent directly to their homes.
""It's vital that as many people as possible who are at higher risk from complications of COVID-19 join the trial, so we can rapidly learn if exciting new treatments really do help people get better quicker and reduce pressures on the National Health Service,"" Butler said.
The UK's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam, said that antiviral drugs could provide a ""vital intervention for years to come"". The UK has achieved high vaccination coverage, though the rate of infections is still high, averaging almost 48,000 per day this week, and there are concerns that existing vaccines may be less effective against new variants, including Omicron.
Molnupiravir, an experimental antiviral initially developed to treat influenza, performed well in clinical trials for the treatment of COVID-19 this fall, after which the UK drug regulator approved the drug for use in November.
The UK ordered 480,000 courses of Molnupiravir from pharmaceutical company Merck Sharp and Dohme in October, in preparation for a spike in COVID-19 infections this winter.
The UK also ordered 250,000 courses of Ritonavir, another drug that can be taken in pill form. Ritonavir is most commonly used to treat HIV/AIDS, and the antiviral has shown promise in reducing severe illness and hospitalization from COVID-19 in trials run by Pfizer.
The PANORAMIC program will next launch a nationwide trial for Ronapreve, a novel monoclonal antibody treatment for COVID-19, with more drug trials to follow under the program.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); CLINICAL TRIALS (89%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (89%); VACCINES (89%); ADULTS (78%); CANCER (78%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (78%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (78%); LEVELS OF CARE (78%); MEDICAL TREATMENTS & PROCEDURES (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (77%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (77%); VIRUSES (77%); EXPERIMENTAL DRUGS (76%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (75%); INFLUENZA (75%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (73%); CONGENITAL DISORDERS (72%); DOWN SYNDROME (72%); APPROVALS (71%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (70%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (67%); NATIONAL HEALTH INSURANCE (67%); INVESTIGATIONS (66%); EXECUTIVES (63%)

Health experts in Africa are calling for caution in the easing of COVID-19 restrictions across the continent, following a decline in the number of new cases since January.
""Our analysis is clear evidence of the continued significant circulation of the COVID-19 virus amongst people on the continent. With this comes the heightened risk of more lethal variants that can overwhelm existing immunity,"" said Matshidiso Moeti, the World Health Organization's regional director for Africa, on Thursday.
John Nkengasong, director of the Africa Centres for Disease Control and Prevention, urged African governments to continue promoting health measures as well as increasing vaccination rates even as they ease curbs. He warned that the lifting of restrictions may also lead to reinfection as has been the case in Europe and other parts of the world.
Juma Maleve, a clinical officer from Kenya's coastal city of Mombasa, also shared similar sentiments and warned Africans against interpreting ease of restrictions to mean that COVID-19 is over.
Warning issued
""We are not safe until the pandemic is declared over globally. We are just in a low season of COVID-19 transmissions. We may not know whether there will be an upsurge of another variant, so we have to remain vigilant,"" Maleve said.
He specifically warned Kenyans, who are no longer observing health measures after the government lifted the remaining COVID-19 restrictions on March 11.
According to data from the Africa CDC, about 16 percent of the African population is fully vaccinated compared to the global average of 57 percent.
The total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases in Africa has exceeded 11 million, though a fresh analysis conducted by the WHO reveals that available data is likely only scratching the surface of the real extent of infections in the continent. The WHO said the true number of infections could be as much as 97 times higher than the number of confirmed reported cases. It also suggested that more than two-thirds of all Africans have been exposed to COVID-19.
Following a decline in new reported COVID-19 cases recently, many African countries have eased pandemic prevention and control measures. At least 19 African countries have eased restrictions on mass gatherings, according to WHO data. By mid-March, 22 African countries were no longer carrying out any kind of contact tracing.
Last week, South Africa, the most hard-hit country in the continent, lifted most of the mandatory measures, with the remaining restrictions, including those for gatherings and international travel, expected to lapse by May 4.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (90%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (89%); EPIDEMICS (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); DISEASE CONTACT TRACING (78%); PREVENTION & WELLNESS (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); VACCINES (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (77%); DISEASE REPORTING (76%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (76%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (73%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (70%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (70%)

Residents living in areas that have zero COVID-19 community transmission will be permitted limited mobility, the Shanghai municipal government announced on Wednesday.
The city reported 1,606 confirmed COVID-19 cases and 11,956 asymptomatic infections on Tuesday, a big fall in numbers compared with the previous day. Moreover, only 171 of these individuals were from outside controlled or closed-loop management zones, according to statistics from the municipal health commission.
Zhao Dandan, deputy director of the municipal health commission, said that though efforts to break the transmission chains have started to show good results, the overall epidemic situation is still ""very grim"".
Stringent epidemic control measures including closed-loop management, nucleic acid and antigen testing, thorough epidemiological investigation and disinfection will continue in areas that have yet to achieve zero community transmission, Zhao added.
Another round of nucleic acid and antigen testing will take place from Wednesday to Saturday based on each compound's current risk level. The list of locked down, controlled and precautionary areas will then be adjusted based on the test results, Zhao added.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); EPIDEMICS (90%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (77%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (76%); CITIES (72%); CITY GOVERNMENT (72%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (72%); STATISTICS (72%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (57%)

China's CanSino Biologics said on Sunday that its inhalable COVID-19 vaccine has been given emergency use authorization by the country's top drug regulator.
The dose is an aerosolized version of a single-shot, adenovirus-based viral vector vaccine already in use domestically and worldwide. It will be used as a booster only, according to the notice.
It is the first aerosolized vaccine to be approved for public use in China. All nine vaccines that have obtained either conditional market approval or emergency use approval from the National Medical Products Administration so far, are delivered intravenously.
An aerosolized COVID-19 vaccine has emerged as a promising field of research due to its easy accessibility and unique way of stimulating protection, according to experts.
Sunney Xie Xiaoliang, a biophysical chemist at Peking University and an academician of the Chinese Academy of Sciences, said during a forum in Beijing over the weekend that aerosolized vaccines could be an effective way to protect against respiratory diseases, including COVID-19, in the future.
The nasal cavity is the body's first barrier to the novel coronavirus. Delivering vaccines via this route can stimulate immune responses on mucosal surfaces where viruses enter, according to Xie.
""Using it as a booster shot can also trigger higher levels of humoral immunity as well as cellular immunity, which are potentially capable of clearing the virus within a shorter period,"" he said.
The most recent published study on aerosolized vaccines shows that when given as a booster, the vaccine candidate stimulated a stronger antibody response in fully vaccinated adults than an inactivated jab.
The study was conducted in China and published in early August on medRixv, a preprint platform.
""Orally administered aerosolized vaccines might become a valuable addition to the existing SARS-CoV-2 vaccine pools,"" it said.","VACCINES (98%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); VIRUSES (91%); APPROVALS (90%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); RESPIRATORY DISORDERS & INJURIES (90%); CORONAVIRUSES (89%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (77%); EXPERIMENTATION & RESEARCH (74%); IMMUNOLOGY (74%); RESEARCH REPORTS (74%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (73%); SARS (71%); BIOPHYSICS (69%)

The number of new COVID-19 infections in Africa continues to decline as countries scale up vaccination to achieve herd immunity, as the continent marked two years since reporting the first COVID-19 case on Monday.
According to data from Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, between Jan 31 and Feb 6 the continent reported a 29 percent decrease in the number of new cases.
COVID-19 deaths also declined by 6 percent compared with the previous week when fatalities were on an upward trend.
The highest proportion of new cases came from the northern Africa region, accounting for 68, followed by the southern region with 21 percent.
Among the five countries that reported the highest number of new cases, four were from northern Africa &mdash; Tunisia leading with 35, 640 cases followed by Libya with 23,284, Egypt with 15,963 and Morocco with 14,527 new cases.
South Africa reported the third highest number of new cases at 20, 106.
So far, 40 member states of the African Union have reported the Omicron variant and according to Africa CDC director John Nkengasong, since November six member states have reported the Omicron BA.2 sub-lineage.
Nkengasong said the sub-lineage is currently the dominant variant in South Africa but noted there should be no cause for alarm provided people continue to observe the health measures of wearing face masks when in public and observing social distance as well as getting vaccinated.
""Even if transmissibility of the sub-lineage is higher than the parent Omicron, there is no severity of disease and no differences in vaccine response,"" he said.
To date, Africa has fully vaccinated 11.7 percent of its population against COVID-19 and even though the continent lags behind on the rate of vaccination compared to other parts of the world, it now has a steady supply of vaccines.
Data from the World Health Organization indicate the continent has received around 672 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, of which 65 percent were facilitated by COVAX, 29 percent via bilateral deals and six percent though the African Union's Vaccines Acquisition Trust.
To further enhance vaccine uptake across the continent, Nkengasong said plans are underway to launch the African Youth for COVID-19 Vaccination Initiative in the next two weeks.
The campaign, which will be spearheaded by the AU Commission youth division and the AU Youth Envoy, is aimed at encouraging young people to get vaccinated.
""We believe strongly that if we don't engage the youth and take ownership and leadership of this, we will continue to struggle to get the 70 percent target,"" Nkengasong said.
""The bulk of who we see as hesitant to vaccines are probably young people. If they step in and show ownership and leadership and recognize that this is a generational crisis and if we don't get them involved and solve it, we will continue to live with the virus.""",COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); VACCINES (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (89%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (89%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (89%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (78%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (78%); TRENDS (78%); PREVENTION & WELLNESS (77%); DEATH & DYING (76%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (66%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (60%)

Global confirmed COVID-19 cases have been rising since Omicron replaced Delta as the dominant variant. Due to the mild symptoms of Omicron, in addition to the fact that many infected patients can recover on their own, people's attitude toward both the seriousness of the pandemic and the acceptability of restrictive measures have been changing dramatically.
From an individual perspective, besides cooperating with the local government's measures against COVID-19, being aware of personal protection, such as wearing a surgical mask, getting vaccinated and social distancing, may well be the only factor we can control. Nevertheless, one may find three noteworthy elements throughout the process of confronting COVID-19, namely humility, reflection and gratitude.
Be humble
Since the end of 2019, mass spread of COVID-19 has been reported around the world. In view of the unexpected crisis, on one hand was the worry of people living in the infected areas, on the other hand was the ridicule from some who lived elsewhere. Various concepts were noticed along with the pandemic development. Not only did it reflect the ignorance and arrogance of those who said such words, but it also revealed the fact that they were not prepared for the possibility of going through the same catastrophe.
Soon after, we all witnessed the United States, who has the most advanced technology and developed medical system, almost totally failed in the face of the spread of COVID-19. According to statistics provided by Johns Hopkins University, as of April 9, 2022, over 80 million total cases and over 985,000 deaths were recorded there. If we take a look at the most recent data from the World Bank, the entire population of the United States in 2020 was 329 million.
Instinctive feelings aside, are we prepared for the same situation in order to avoid making the same mistakes, or just simply seeing oneself as smarter and more exceptional? For instance, some of the following typical problems may still be found in different cities, including but not limited to the problem of the collapse of the medical system, the problem of insufficient quarantine facilities, the problem of epidemiological investigations lagging behind, the problem of formulating appropriate emergency plan (e.g. timetable for mass testing), the problem of adjusting restrictive measures (e.g. the criteria or indicator) and the problem of the supply of daily necessities. While watching numerous examples of pride going before a fall, one should stop and look in the mirror.
In this regard, being humble is important, because we may encounter the same challenges, may make the same mistakes and may need the same assistance. Humility allows one to learn to let go of pride and put oneself in the other's shoes.
Be reflective
As a famous online quote said, ""There is indeed no carefree time, but someone has been shouldering the burden for you"". In light of COVID-19, a significant number of medical staff, law enforcement, cleaning staff and logistics staff, have been working on the front lines subjected to varied extent of infection risks. Although the phenomenon of the so-called anti-pandemic fatigue is not surprising, some misbehaviors may in fact break the law, moreover jeopardize the efforts of those who have been keeping up their good work silently.
One should realize that, no matter how others behave, it cannot be an excuse for abandoning one's responsibilities in the battle against COVID-19. Keep blaming others or saying that all are the policies' faults have little effect in making the situation better. Furthermore, each country or region should design its anti-pandemic strategy with reference to its context. In terms of policy advice, we need to avoid falling into meaningless comparisons.
While facing the internal desire to criticize, we should all learn to restrain ourselves. This does not mean self-censorship, rather, bear in mind that criticism may not bring forward any contribution at all. From the perspective of fighting COVID-19 together, self-reflection encourages people to turn their focus, from finding fault with others to discovering one's potential, by thinking in what they can follow the example of front liners. If you think something is wrong with the current anti-pandemic work, apart from passively commenting on their limits and the possible causes, you may also actively participate in it, thereby improving the quality of work with your own efforts.
Be grateful
Although the end of the pandemic has not been seen yet, a considerable number of people are still willing to dedicate their time and effort to the work against COVID-19 in their respective cities. In addition to the city-wide passion and the sense of mission, such willingness is also backed by the factor of gratitude.
At the local level, taking Hong Kong as an example, ""Hong Kong Volunteers Against Coronavirus"", political party teams and civil organizations have taken an active role in supporting and caring for the local community. At the national level, Chinese people always have the spirit of ""when one place suffers misfortune, help comes from all quarters"". When Hong Kong suffered from the serious challenge of the fifth wave of COVID-19, the mainland immediately offered its support without hesitation, for instance, manpower in testing service, food supply and assistance in building ""fangcang hospitals""(makeshift hospitals).
The recent outbreak of COVID-19 in Shanghai drew nationwide attention as well. In response, multiple provinces have lent a hand to the city. At the international level, the World Health Organization advocates the idea of sharing vaccines with those in need, and some of the countries are willing to undertake more missions in international aid.
Despite no professional training in the medical field, we can still devote ourselves to community services, and packing, delivering or distributing anti-pandemic materials can be a good start. Individuals may seem trivial on many occasions, however, remember that society is built on the unity of each ""trivial"" person. When everyone in society is willing to take a step forward, each tiny output will gradually gather into a mighty force. Together, we shall conquer.

Beijing is facing a severe and complicated COVID-19 epidemic control and prevention situation, with seven new locally transmitted cases reported between Monday and 4 pm Tuesday, a senior official said, adding that the patients include a family cluster.
As COVID-19 outbreaks are still hitting many areas in China and overseas, Beijing is facing a severe prevention and control situation, with the major threat from outside the capital, Xu Hejian, a spokesman for the Beijing municipal government, said at a news conference on Tuesday afternoon.
""The authorities should tighten measures on people returning to Beijing from other areas in the country so that a 48-hour valid negative nucleic acid testing result and green health code are both required on arrival,"" he said. ""All companies in Beijing should strictly follow the prevention and control measures involving group events, meetings and training classes. Video conferences are recommended for such activities.""
Three of the seven new locally transmitted cases are in the capital's Haidian district and four in its Chaoyang district, said Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
The four cases in Chaoyang are from one family &ndash; an elder sister, a younger brother, their mother and great-grandmother.
Health authorities in Chaoyang triggered an emergency response mechanism, launched an epidemiological investigation and a nucleic acid testing campaign, and placed areas involved under strict control after the two children tested positive for COVID-19 in a preliminary screening.
The Chaoyang district government was notified by the disease control and prevention center in Beijing's Tongzhou district on Monday after the two children, who live in Chaoyang, tested positive for the novel coronavirus at Tongzhou Maternal and Child Health Care Hospital.
The three cases in Haidian include a married couple. The husband returned from Shanghai on China Eastern Airlines' flight MU5121 on Feb 27.
The other patient in Haidian developed a fever on Sunday and arrived at a local hospital on Monday, where a nucleic acid test confirmed they were infected.

The Beijing government has tightened COVID-19 control measures on the transportation sector to reduce potential risks.
Starting Wednesday, people who have been to inland border cities in the previous 14 days should not come or return to Beijing if it's not absolutely necessary, the municipal government announced at a news conference on Tuesday.
Those border cities or counties total 51 — 12 in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, 10 in Heilongjiang province, 10 in Yunnan, nine in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, six in the Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region, three in the Tibet autonomous region and one in Jilin.
Residents in Beijing should not go to those border cities or counties.
Beijing has also cut direct flights to the capital from cities where locally transmitted cases were reported. There is only one flight from those cities to Beijing at present and passenger load factors should not be higher than 75 percent, according to the civil aviation authority on Tuesday.
In addition, starting on Wednesday, for all people who come to Beijing via railway, expressway or flights, they should hold negative results of a nucleic acid test taken within 48 hours before their departure, as well as a green health code with Beijing Health Kit - a mobile app with information on an individual's health status.
At present, Beijing has two medium-level risk areas for COVID-19 and the rest are low-risk.
Beijing reported one locally transmitted case on Monday, who was a close contact of the previous confirmed cases, according to the National Health Commission on Tuesday.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (89%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (78%); PRESS CONFERENCES (78%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (76%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (76%); TRANSPORTATION SECTOR PERFORMANCE (76%); CITY GOVERNMENT (75%); AVIATION ADMINISTRATION (72%); AVIATION TRANSPORTATION LAW (72%); CITIES (70%); AIRLINES PASSENGER TRAFFIC (67%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (64%)

China's top drug regulator has given conditional approval for Pfizer's COVID-19 treatment Paxlovid, making it the first oral pill for the disease approved in the country.
The drug can be used to treat adults who have mild to moderate symptoms and a high risk of progressing to more severe disease, the National Medical Products Administration said on Saturday. These patients include the elderly and people with chronic kidney or lung issues, cardiovascular disease, diabetes and other high-risk factors.
Clinical trial data released by Pfizer found that Paxlovid could reduce the risk of COVID-19-related hospitalization or death by 87.8 percent when given within five days of the onset of symptoms. The drug was also found effective against the prevailing variants of concern, including the Delta and Omicron variants.
As of Saturday, Paxlovid is authorized for emergency use and has been granted conditional marketing approval in about 40 countries, including the United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Israel, Germany, Belgium, South Korea, Singapore and Japan.
China's announcement to greenlight the drug has spurred speculation whether it may adjust its epidemic control measures.
However, experts and regulators from countries that have adopted the drug routinely stressed that the medication is for treating patients who are already ill. It is not a substitute for vaccination, social distancing, maintaining personal hygiene and other preventive measures.
A pharmaceutical scientist in Beijing who requested anonymity said having an oral medicine like Paxlovid to treat COVID-19 is more convenient for patients and health workers than treatments that require intravenous injection in a hospital setting, such as monoclonal antibodies and the antiviral drug remdesivir.
But as dozens of wealthy countries are lining up for Paxlovid, the World Health Organization warned last month that there could be a high risk of it being in short supply in low- and middle-income countries. Because of this, the expert said it would be unwise and irrational for China to change its time-tested epidemic control policy based on a drug that could be hard to procure.
""Paxlovid is not a magic bullet to end the pandemic,"" the expert said. ""Nevertheless, China's approving the pill can send a strong signal to the domestic pharmaceutical industry to accelerate their research into drugs to treat COVID-19.""
Clinical data indicate Paxlovid is well-tolerated and there have been few reported cases of adverse reactions. Common side effects are generally mild, including diarrhea, vomiting, hypertension and muscle pain.
One possible setback is that the drug may interact with common medications used to treat irregular heartbeat, migraines, psychosis and high cholesterol, leading to reduced efficacy or more serious adverse events, according to the United States Food and Drug Administration.
As a result, the FDA said, physicians should carefully consider the potential for drug interactions when prescribing the drug.","COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); APPROVALS (90%); CLINICAL TRIALS (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (90%); DRUG SAFETY REGULATION (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); DRUG FAST TRACKING (78%); HEALTH CARE RATIONING (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); PHARMACEUTICAL CHEMISTRY (78%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (78%); VACCINES (78%); CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (77%); DISEASE REPORTING (77%); DRUG INTERACTIONS & SIDE EFFECTS (77%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (77%); ADULTS (76%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (76%); DIABETES (72%); HEADACHES (72%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (72%); PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS (72%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (72%); CHOLESTEROL (71%); HYPERTENSION (70%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (50%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (50%)

On May 9, the yoga gym where Zhong Shiyu works sent a notice to its members telling them that it was suspending offline classes because of a rise in the number of COVID-19 cases in Beijing.
The last time the gym suspended services was in early 2020, when the epidemic first broke out. Then, classes were suspended for four months.
""COVID-19 has been fatal to gyms. ""A friend who runs an online system that allows gym members to book classes said that about 70 percent of gyms have canceled the service, which means many of them have closed,"" she said.
Zhong is happy to see that a fitness wave is sweeping the country. She is especially cheered that yoga, which is reputed to build a good physique and improve health, has become more popular.
There have even been media reports about people practicing yoga at temporary hospitals built for COVID-19 isolation, observation and treatment.
""Public fitness is different from gym fitness, though, and most people are not prepared to pay for exercise,"" said the yoga teacher, who has a diploma in psychology approved by the Chinese Academy of Sciences and has practiced the discipline for 15 years.
She said it's great that people are increasingly realizing the importance of fitness and health, but she believes that professional instruction is essential.
""If you have the exercise habit and know-how, you can benefit a lot from following livestreamers to work out, but if someone lacks knowledge or has joint problems or water on the knee, they might get injured,"" she said.
While the Beijing OM Yoga Gym, where Zhong works as a spokeswoman, has survived the epidemic, it has been badly affected, with the average number of classes falling to about 500 per month from 800.
However, Zhong believes that such difficulties may improve the industry.
""Those who can survive must have core competitiveness, and they have to keep improving to adjust to market changes,"" she said, adding that the most important element is professionalism, while capital support and a determined team are also crucial for survival.
""We only hire yoga teachers who have college degrees, professional accreditation and more than five years' teaching experience. That's an 'exercise effect' guarantee for gym members that wins trust,"" Zhong said.
""Trust is the most valuable factor for a sustainable fitness business.""
She is enthusiastic about practicing yoga and sharing her experience, and she believes that in the face of the epidemic, fitness industry players will have to improve their services and professional standards to become more competitive, thus making the industry more prosperous.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); EXERCISE & FITNESS (91%); YOGA (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PHYSICAL FITNESS (90%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (90%); COACHES & TRAINERS (89%); ACCREDITATION (78%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (78%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (74%); CERTIFICATES, DEGREES & DIPLOMAS (71%); PSYCHOLOGY (66%); TEACHER RECRUITMENT & HIRING (66%); KNEE DISORDERS & INJURIES (63%)"

Qionghai on the eastern coast of Hainan island reported one new mild COVID-19 case on Thursday. The patient, who arrived by air from Shanghai on Monday, has been transferred to a designated local hospital for treatment, according to the Qionghai COVID-19 prevent and control headquarters.
The office said emergency measures have been arranged to conduct investigations and disposal, with close-contact people being put under isolation and control while relevant places were well disinfected.
Preliminary survey showed that the patient arrived at the Haikou Meilan International Airport from Shanghai by HO1271 on Monday morning and took a nucleic acid test upon landing. The patient then went to Qionghai by a private car and checked in at Dongyu Island Hotel, Boao town, where the 2022 Boao Forum for Asia annual conference will be held between April 20 to 22.
The patient went out for meal and other business several times in the past two days after arriving at Boao town, until being required for centralized isolation by the municipal epidemic prevention and control headquarters on Wednesday afternoon.
On Tuesday, another NAT positive case of an inbound traveler was reported by the Qionghai disease control center. The 8-years-old female entered Shenzhen from Hong Kong with her grandmother and brother on March 13. After 14 days of isolation in Shenzhen, they arrived at the Meilan airport by CZ6253 on March 28 and then were transferred to Qionghai Guantang Hot Spring Leisure Center for isolation and closed-loop management.
To strengthen COVID-19 prevent and control, the Hainan provincial authorities issued a notice on Tuesday, informing travelers entering Hainan from COVID-19 pandemic-affected areas, who experience symptoms such as throat discomfort or fever within 7 days of arrival, take the initiative to report to the local communities, working institutions, or hotels. The notice also inform relevant travelers take a NAT test and carry out health management immediately, to ensure protection for themselves and people around.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (90%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (78%); ISLANDS & REEFS (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (72%); EPIDEMICS (71%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (68%); EXERCISE & FITNESS (68%); POLLS & SURVEYS (56%)

China has entered a new stage in its fight against the COVID-19 epidemic that calls for earlier detection and faster action to cope with the rapidly spreading Omicron variant, said Ma Xiaowei, minister of the National Health Commission.
Faced with the highly transmissible Omicron strain, the country should roll out the strictest, most thorough and resolute measures to coordinate comprehensive steps and cut transmission in the shortest possible time, he wrote in a signed article published on Monday.
Relaxing COVID-19 disease control measures will threaten to stretch the country's unevenly distributed medical systems too thin and hurt its large number of elderly and vulnerable people, he said.
In the article, Ma made it clear that China has entered the fourth stage of its battle against the disease. The first three phases covered the epidemic centering in Hubei province; exploring and implementing regular disease control measures; and initiating the dynamic zero-COVID strategy.
While urging unswerving adherence to the dynamic zero-COVID strategy, Ma said upgraded measures are needed in the current stage, such as adding antigen tests to mass screening campaigns and expanding the capacity of quarantine facilities and makeshift hospitals.
The article was published in Study Times, a newspaper administered by the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It comes at a time when China is battling a severe wave of COVID-19 outbreaks fueled by the highly infectious Omicron variant, and its economic powerhouse of Shanghai has confronted weeks of surging infections.
As the recent epidemic triggered debates over the rationality of persisting with the dynamic clearance approach, Ma said it is essential to take a clear-cut stand against erroneous thoughts such as ""coexisting with the virus"" or ""the novel coronavirus is becoming flu-like"".
""We must continue to improve our disease control measures and achieve the goal of cutting transmission in communities in the most determined, resolute and comprehensive manner,"" he said. The fundamental goal of adopting the dynamic zero-COVID policy has always been safeguarding the health of our people, he added.
Given that China has the world's largest population, but uneven development across vast amounts of land and a shortage of overall healthcare resources, easing disease control measures in the face of frequent COVID-19 cases would take a heavy toll on people's lives, as well as social and economic development, he said.
""If we abandon prevention efforts and relax treatment measures, China's medical systems will be overwhelmed and the health of its large number of people with underlying illnesses, the elderly, children and pregnant women will be at risk,"" he said.
""Such consequences will not be accepted by our people, nor will it be allowed to happen under the leadership of the Party and government,"" he said.
Shanghai reported seven COVID-19 deaths on Monday, following three deaths announced on Sunday. The 10 people who died were between the ages of 60 and 101, unvaccinated and suffered from serious underlying ailments such as heart disease, diabetes and cerebral hemorrhaging, according to the city's health authorities.
Advanced measures needed
According to data released on Tuesday, the Chinese mainland had 3,297 locally transmitted new COVID-19 cases and 18,187 local asymptomatic cases on Monday.
Wu Liangyou, deputy director of the commission's Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control, said on Tuesday the most recent wave of the epidemic has begun to stabilize, but the cross-regional spread of the virus remains serious, and achieving the goal of dynamically clearing cases remains an arduous task.
In the article, Ma, the minister of the National Health Commission, stressed the need to tailor disease control toolkits to cope with the current strain of Omicron, which is transmitted in a faster and more covert way than the Delta strain, its predecessor. Because a large proportion of those infected by the Omicron strain are asymptomatic, China's monitoring defense against COVID-19 should be strengthened, he said.
""In addition to fever sentinel clinics, mass screening of key groups and quick reporting, we should make full use of rapid and convenient antigen tests and integrate that method with nucleic acid testing,"" Ma said.
As Omicron can lead to a spike in new cases in a short time, Ma said the shortage of quarantine sites and temporary hospitals, the most acute problem at the moment, must be addressed.
Only when sufficient isolation facilities are available, and all patients with asymptomatic and mild cases are admitted to makeshift hospitals, can effective control of Omicron outbreaks be attained while guaranteeing a smooth and consistent provision of normal medical services, he said.
To relieve the burden on healthcare systems requires the timely triage of COVID-19 patients, Ma said. He specified that people who show pneumonia-like symptoms and suffer from chronic diseases, particularly when they are elderly or children, should be admitted to designated hospitals.
""Mild and symptom-free cases should be received by makeshift hospitals, and patients who have recovered should return home for self-isolation, so as to prevent them from taking up daily hospital resources,"" he said.
Meanwhile, Ma stressed, heightened attention should be given to meet people's normal medical and healthcare needs.
""General hospitals, children's hospitals and maternal and childcare health centers should provide regular services as usual (during a local outbreak),"" he said, adding that special channels in locked-down areas should be provided for people in need, including those with chronic diseases or in critical condition.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (89%); COMMUNISM (79%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (78%); ISOLATION & QUARANTINE (78%); SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLE (78%); VIRUSES (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (77%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (77%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (77%); NEGATIVE NEWS (76%); VULNERABLE ADULTS (75%); VULNERABLE HEALTH POPULATIONS (74%); WOMEN'S HEALTH (73%); BUSINESS NEWS (69%); POLITICAL PARTIES (66%); POLITICS (65%); PREGNANCY & CHILDBIRTH (60%); SHORTAGES (50%)"

Yiwu, a small production hub in Jinhua, Zhejiang province, reported four locally transmitted confirmed cases of COVID-19 and two asymptomatic infections as of 10 am on Wednesday, health authorities said.
As of 9 am on Wednesday, 772 close contacts and 368 secondary close contacts had been traced and put under quarantine to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
The city, home to 1.9 million people, has tightened its epidemic-control measures. On Wednesday, schools, kindergartens and off-campus training institutions suspended teaching activities. Gatherings, including meetings, forums, training sessions, performances, exams and exhibitions have all been suspended, along with dine-in services at restaurants in Yiwu.
A 48-hour negative nucleic acid test certificate is required for people using public transportation.
The supermarkets in the city have sufficient inventory to meet the demand, and the city provides smooth purchase channels, said Yang Zhonghong, director of Yiwu municipal bureau of commerce on Wednesday.
The existing stock of rice and noodles in the grain market is more than 16,000 metric tons, ensuring a stable supply of daily necessities for 19 days, he said.

British study shows recovered patients displaying signs of reduced intelligence
COVID-19 disease can lead to a reduction in cognitive ability, according to a United Kingdom study that found many people recovering from the illness scored lower on intelligence tests than people who had not contracted the novel coronavirus.
The level of cognitive impairment is linked to the severity of the disease, with some patients who had been hospitalized and put on ventilators experiencing the equivalent of a seven-point drop in IQ, according to the study, which was published in The Lancet.
Adam Hampshire, a cognitive neuroscientist at Imperial College London and lead author of the paper, said it remains unclear how long the impact on cognition lasts following infection. But Hampshire said the results should be considered carefully by authorities, especially in places like the UK, where lockdown and social distancing rules have been lifted. ""I think it is fair to say that those of us who have been analyzing data, such as this, are somewhat nervous at the decision to let the pandemic run its course within the UK,"" Hampshire told neuroscience news website PsyPost.
Hampshire had been collecting data in collaboration with the BBC for a major UK survey called The Great British Intelligence Test when the pandemic hit last year, and researchers decided to incorporate analysis of COVID-19.
Of the 81,337 people who participated in the intelligence survey last year, 12,689 individuals reported that they had tested positive for COVID-19.
""People who had recovered from COVID-19... exhibited significant cognitive deficits,"" said the study's authors, who controlled for age, gender, education level, income, racial-ethnic group, pre-existing medical disorders, tiredness, depression, and anxiety.
The study found a notable dip in performance in tests of attention, working memory, problem solving, and emotional processing among people who had reported having COVID-19.
""These results accord with reports of long-COVID, where 'brain fog', trouble concentrating, and difficulty finding the correct words are common,"" the authors said.
Christina Pagel, director of the Clinical Operational Research Unit at University College London, said evidence for the long-term neurological impact of COVID-19 and other impacts of the disease is growing.
""But the government's position seems to be that infections don't matter as long as the NHS is not overwhelmed,"" Pagel, who was not involved in the research, said on Twitter. ""I worry that, once again, we are watching an unfolding disaster while waiting for unequivocal evidence. Unequivocal evidence on long-term impacts will, by definition, take months or years. Maybe it never will, but so far, the trajectory is toward more certain evidence, not less.""
The study had some limitations, most notably the fact that only 275 participants took the intelligence test both before and after having contracted the virus and Hampshire and his colleagues said more research is needed to establish the link between COVID-19 and impaired cognition.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INTELLIGENCE & COGNITION (90%); NEUROSCIENCE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); RESEARCH REPORTS (90%); VIRUSES (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); WRITERS (89%); BEHAVIOR & COGNITION (78%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (78%); EMOTIONS (78%); MEMORY (78%); PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (78%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (78%); POLLS & SURVEYS (74%); MEMORY DISORDERS (73%); DEPRESSION (72%); MENTAL ILLNESS (72%); COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (68%); DEMOGRAPHIC GROUPS (61%); ETHNIC GROUPS (61%)

China is expected to lead COVID-19 antigen self-testing, with industry-leading inspection results as well as strong production and supply capacity as the market opens wider, China Securities Journal reported on Monday.
The market size of self-testing products for COVID-19 antigen on e-commerce platforms may exceed 10 billion yuan ($1.57 billion) in one month, according to the report.
The National Medical Products Administration announced that the first batch of five self-testing products for COVID-19 antigen officially went on sale on March 12.
These products can be found on Meituan Maiyao, a medicine service provider of e-commerce platform Meituan.
Many chain pharmacies and other pharmaceutical e-commerce platforms also announced they are in cooperation or under discussion with approved pharmaceutical manufacturers to launch the products.
The antigen detection was added as a supplement on the basis of nucleic acid detection, and a trial protocol for novel coronavirus antigen detection application was also formulated and issued, the National Health Commission announced on March 11.
The five approved brands are all domestic companies, and include Vazyme Biotech and Beijing Jinwofu Bioengineering Technology.
The domestic market for COVID-19 antigen detection is projected to range from 17.7 billion to 26.6 billion yuan a month, with increasing purchasing demand, according to a research report by Zhongtai Securities.

Stricter control and prevention measures have been introduced to fight COVID-19 in Shenzhen, Guangdong province, as the city remains at high risk of community transmission, a senior official said on Monday.
Metro and bus services have been suspended and people working for the government and enterprises have been told to work from home to help curb the spread of the novel coronavirus in the city, Huang Qiang, deputy secretary-general of Shenzhen's city government, said at a news conference on Monday.
""Except for those who have to go out to undertake their pandemic prevention and control tasks, government employees and staff members at all levels in the city are required to work from home, or work as community volunteers to help fight against COVID-19,"" he said, adding that the measures that came into effect on Monday will last until at least Sunday.
Huang said the number of reported infections in Shenzhen fluctuated again recently, increasing the pressure to block the spread of the virus in the city, which borders Hong Kong.
""The number of confirmed cases detected in the city's key areas, key groups and communities continued to rise, with small clusters of infections reported in urban villages and factories,"" he said.
""These indicate we still need to introduce and implement concrete and effective measures to guard the city against the pandemic in the weeks to come.""
To curb the spread of the novel coronavirus in Shenzhen, the city government started three rounds of citywide nucleic acid testing on Monday.
Lin Hancheng, an inspector for Shenzhen's health commission, said the operations of major hospitals and medical institutions and medical services in the city will not be affected as no effort is spared in the fight against the pandemic.
""No medical institutions are allowed to refuse patients on any pretext,"" he said.
Xu Wei, deputy director of the city's transportation bureau, said residents can book car-hailing and taxi services online when they need to go out, or they can dial a hotline for help in case of emergency.
Mo Xiling, deputy director of Shenzhen's market regulation administration, said the city's supplies of meat, eggs, vegetables, milk and other food are adequate and prices remain stable.
In Dongguan, a major production base neighboring Shenzhen, the city government launched citywide nucleic acid testing on Monday to identify possible COVID-19 patients and asymptomatic carriers and suspended all public bus services.
Large-scale conferences, events, forums, performances, sales promotions, public dancing and gatherings have temporarily been suspended, and all commercial entertainment venues in the city have been temporarily closed.
The Guangdong Provincial Health Commission said the province reported 79 locally transmitted confirmed cases and 151 local asymptomatic carriers on Sunday. Of those, 75 confirmed cases and 11 asymptomatic carriers were in Shenzhen, while Dongguan confirmed two patients and 140 asymptomatic carriers.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); CITIES (89%); CITY GOVERNMENT (89%); CORONAVIRUSES (89%); DISEASE REPORTING (89%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (89%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (89%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (89%); TELECOMMUTING (89%); VIRUSES (89%); HEALTH CARE RATIONING (78%); HOME BASED EMPLOYMENT (78%); PRESS CONFERENCES (78%); CIVIL SERVICES (77%); VOLUNTEERS (71%); BUSINESS INTERRUPTIONS (70%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (65%); SALES & SELLING (62%); CONFERENCES & CONVENTIONS (60%)

Despite the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Chinese economy registered moderate growth in the first quarter. We believe that stronger policy support will be rolled out in the second quarter to realize steady growth.
Figures from the National Bureau of Statistics showed that for the first quarter, China's gross domestic product rose 4.8 percent compared with the same period a year earlier. On a quarter-on-quarter basis, the GDP grew 1.3 percent. This indicates that for the first quarter, the momentum of domestic growth has generally weakened amid rising complexities and uncertainties at home and abroad.
Specifically, real estate investment and consumption were the two major sectors weighing on growth in the first quarter. NBS figures showed that the overall first-quarter sales area of residential housing in China fell 13.8 percent year-on-year, with total sales volume declining by 22.7 percent. We believe expectations of rising property prices are weakening, while uncertainty in household incomes has hampered potential homebuyers' willingness to buy property, and these contributed to the weakening property sales. The softening demand led to weaker property investment. Real estate investment grew by a mere 0.7 percent in the first quarter compared with a 3.7 percent yearly growth in the fourth quarter last year.
In addition, the lingering COVID-19 situation has hampered residents' willingness to ponder home buying. This is particularly reflected in housing sales in first-tier cities, as both Shenzhen, Guangdong province, and Shanghai have been affected by the current round of COVID-19 resurgences. As real estate sales decline, funding for developers encounters pressure. At the same time, growth in home loans is also dropping.
This year, there have been multiple policy signals pointing to more funding support for real estate developers, yet our reading from figures shows that it is still difficult for real estate businesses to get loans from banks. Against such a backdrop, real estate enterprises are still suffering from a liquidity crunch. And the lack of funding for real estate developers means that going forward, real estate investment will still face downward pressure.
Consumption also shows signs of slackening. With the COVID-19 situation still evolving, uncertainty over household incomes has risen, and people are displaying little willingness to spend. Limited offline buying activity also contributes to weakened consumption. NBS figures show that China's retail sales of consumer goods rose 3.3 percent year-on-year in the first quarter. In March, retail sales decreased by 3.5 percent year-on-year.
Specifically, direct shocks to consumption were revealed via weakening offline consumption. Worries about possible COVID-19 outbreak scenarios and stringent COVID-19 containment measures pushed many to curtail offline travel and consumption. This was revealed by NBS figures that showed catering revenue came in at 293.5 billion yuan ($45.14 billion) in the first quarter, down 16.4 percent year-on-year. In addition, reduced offline outings also curtailed people's spending on social activities. It is notable that spending on clothing and cosmetics went down.
Despite such short-term direct impacts, more attention should be focused on the mid- and long-term impacts on consumer behavior caused by the pandemic. The COVID-19 impact has led to a mere 6.3 percent growth in household income in the first quarter, lower than the overall level last year. Also, as many smaller businesses have been pinched by the pandemic, salary growth has also slowed down in the January-March period.
Despite the above weaker sectors, growth in the first quarter mainly came from the following three sectors.
First was the overall high growth of investment in manufacturing. Benefiting from favorable investment policies and robust export growth, investment in manufacturing continued to recover in the first quarter with an annual growth of 15.6 percent. We also attribute the high growth of manufacturing investment to factors like the government's strong willingness to keep growth stable. Recent State Council executive meetings have urged bringing the role of government bonds into full play to energize investment, and called for an early issuance and allocation of local government special bonds to drive growth.
Second are exports. Impacted by price rises and surging demand from overseas, exports grew robustly in the first quarter, registering 13.4 percent growth year-on-year.
Third is investment in infrastructure. With this year's fiscal policies being front-loaded and working proactively, infrastructure has become a key driver for growth, and infrastructure investment grew by 8.5 percent year-on-year.
Boosted by manufacturing and infrastructure, fixed asset investment grew 9.3 percent year-on-year in the first quarter, notably faster than overall GDP growth, thus becoming a key underpinning for growth.
In summary, we believe that the COVID-19 situation has become the biggest uncertainty for the economy and adds further pressure to a tough situation. Impacted by the changing COVID-19 situation, economic indicators slumped in March compared with the first two months. This also means that when attempting to provide visibility for the economic outlook in April as well as for the second quarter, we need to fully consider the economic impact of COVID-19. The real estate sector has continued to drag on growth, as people's homebuying willingness weakens.
Manufacturing investment grew at a fast pace and has underpinned growth in the first quarter, yet it should be noted that exports may face downward pressure. Manufacturers and smaller businesses require stronger policy support. In addition, infrastructure investment demonstrates robust growth with the help of front-loaded policies, and such momentum is likely to continue.
Going forward, we expect stronger policy support in the second quarter as the recent State Council's executive meeting urged the need to keep growth stable. We expect in particular that fiscal policies will continue to work in advance to generate economic activity to support growth, and more measures boosting consumption will be put in place.

The number of COVID-19 infections in Africa exceeded 9 million on Monday as more countries on the continent continue to report cases of the Omicron variant. Data published by the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showed the continent had also recorded 225,890 virus-related fatalities, with leading health experts urging expanded vaccination in the continent to avert losses of life.
The Omicron COVID-19 variant, first reported by South Africa in November, continues to spread across the continent despite various national containment efforts.
Matshidiso Moeti, WHO Regional Director for Africa, said on Friday evidence from South Africa shows while hospitalizations have increased by almost 70 percent in the past seven days, Intensive Care Unit bed occupancy rates remain low at 7.5 percent.
She added just 14 percent of hospitalized patients in South Africa are reported to have needed supplemental oxygen, and deaths have remained low.
""Africa may not reach the 70 percent vaccination coverage target until August 2024"", she said. Just six countries have hit the year-end target of fully vaccinating 40 percent of their citizens, with only 20 managing to achieve 10 percent coverage, she said.
""I cannot stress strongly enough that vaccination is our best defense against the COVID-19 pandemic. We are at a pivotal moment, and complacency is our enemy. Africa is seeing more consistent delivery of vaccine doses, and we can still save many lives if we urgently accelerate the pace of vaccination,"" she added.
African countries have rolled out mass vaccination drives to contain further spread of the virus. The vaccinations have been picking up in recent months, having initially moved very slowly due to a slow arrival of the life-saving doses.
Southern Africa is the most affected region, followed by the northern and eastern parts of the continent, while Central Africa is the least affected region, according to the Africa CDC.
""In real terms, if African countries get the doses and support necessary to vaccinate 70 percent of their populations as is the case for many wealthy countries, we could avert tens of thousands of deaths from COVID-19 in 2022,"" Moeti said.
John Nkengasong, director of the Africa CDC, in a press conference on Friday said Africa must work urgently toward equitable access to safe and effective vaccines on the continent.
""As vaccine supply increases in many countries, efforts to identify and address barriers to getting shots into arms are critical. Without immediate, coordinated support to address these bottlenecks, the pace of vaccination will remain slow, in spite of the great demand for COVID-19 vaccination,"" he said.
According to Moeti, WHO Africa's COVID-19 strategy going forward into 2022 continues to focus on boosting vaccine coverage. It will also concentrate on increasing surveillance to improve detection and to track new variants of concern.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); VACCINES (91%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (90%); DEATH & DYING (89%); PANDEMICS (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (77%); EPIDEMICS (77%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (77%); PREVENTION & WELLNESS (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (77%); INTENSIVE CARE UNITS (76%); LEVELS OF CARE (75%); PRESS CONFERENCES (73%)

Beijing reported a new family cluster of COVID-19 caused by dining in a roast duck restaurant already involved in several cases during this round of the outbreak, government officials said at a news conference on Monday.
One of the family members dined at the restaurant in Dongcheng district on March 10 - the same day previous cases had been reported as dining in the restaurant who were confirmed to be infected last week.
The person denied having been to the restaurant after the related cases were released to the public, which led to the other five family members being infected and many places - including supermarkets and other restaurants the person had been to, being locked down. The residential community is now under lockdown too, according to Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
""The behavior has increased the risks of the virus spreading and added social costs for the prevention and control of the epidemic,"" she said. ""It's citizens' responsibility to report real information and tracking when being asked.""
According to the center, Beijing reported seven new locally transmitted cases of COVID-19 from 4 pm Sunday to 4 pm Monday involving the districts of Dongcheng and Chaoyang. Six of the seven cases are members of this family and the other one is a cook in the aforementioned restaurant.
On Thursday, Beijing reported eight new locally transmitted cases involving people at the restaurant. Of the eight cases revealed on Thursday, three were staff members and two were diners. The other three infected diners had been reported previously.
Pang reminded the public to reduce dining out in groups during the pandemic and encouraged the use of serving spoons and chopsticks.

Shanghai is expected to achieve zero-COVID beyond areas under closed-loop management in mid-May, and will by then ease COVID-19 restrictions while implementing a tiered management system for communities based on their risk levels, local authorities said on Friday.
According to the city's vice-Mayor Wu Qing, efforts to control the current COVID-19 wave have started to show good results. Despite small fluctuations in daily new infection numbers, over 99 percent of new infections have been identified through testing in closed-loop management zones. In the past three days, only six cases were found in other areas.
""The city is now facing a critical transition from epidemic emergency response to a normalized prevention and control mode,"" Wu said.
Further efforts will be made in key zones for epidemic control and prevention including old neighborhoods and villages with risks of a resurgence, he added.
""We're drafting an outline to consolidate the results of the prevention and control efforts so far and prepare for the resumption of work, business and on-campus education and a return to normalcy,"" Wu said.
Cars will be allowed back on the roads gradually while supermarkets, convenience stores, and other types of businesses such as hairdressing will gradually be allowed to operate.
""Students who need to sit for exams, especially the 9th, 11th and 12th graders in high schools, will be given priority to return to school. More healthcare institutions and government service windows will also be reopened gradually,"" he added.
Shanghai reported 227 new locally transmitted COVID-19 confirmed cases, 1,869 asymptomatic infections and two deaths on Thursday. The two who died were aged 88 and 89.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY EDUCATION (77%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (76%); DISEASE REPORTING (75%); DEATH & DYING (74%); SAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (73%); HIGH SCHOOLS (71%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (71%)"

China has entered a new stage of its fight against the COVID-19 epidemic that calls for earlier detection and faster actions to cope with the rapidly spreading Omicron variant, Ma Xiaowei, minister of the National Health Commission, said.
Faced with the highly transmissible Omicron strain, the country should roll out the strictest, most thorough and resolute measures to coordinate comprehensive steps and cut transmission in the shortest possible time, he said in a signed article published on Monday.
Relaxing COVID-19 disease control measures will threaten to overstretch the country's unevenly distributed medical systems and hurt its large number of seniors and vulnerable people, he said.
In the article, Ma made it clear that China has entered the fourth stage of its fight against the disease. The first three phases were: stemming out the epidemic centering in Hubei province; exploring and implementing regular disease control measures; and initiating the dynamic zero-COVID strategy.
While urging unswerving adherence to the dynamic zero-COVID strategy, Ma said upgraded measures are needed in the current stage, such as adding antigen tests to mass screening campaigns and expanding the capacity of quarantine facilities and makeshift hospitals.
The article was published on Study Times, a newspaper administered by the Party School of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of China. It comes at a time when China is battling a severe wave of COVID-19 outbreaks fueled by the highly infectious Omicron variant, and its economic powerhouse Shanghai has been confronting surging infections for weeks.
As the recent epidemic triggered debates over the rationality of persisting with the dynamic clearance approach, Ma said it is essential to take a clear-cut stand against erroneous thoughts such as ""coexisting with the virus"" or ""the novel coronavirus is becoming flu-like.""
""We must continue to improve our disease control measures and achieve the goal of cutting transmission in communities in the most determined, resolute and comprehensive manner,"" he said.
The fundamental goal of adopting the dynamic zero-COVID policy has always been safeguarding the health of our people, he said.
China's national conditions - home to the world's largest population, uneven development across vast amounts of land and a shortage of overall healthcare resources - have determined that easing disease control measures in the face of frequent COVID-19 resurgences will take a heavy toll on people's lives and social and economic development, he said.
""If we abandon prevention efforts and relax treatment measures, China's medical systems will be overwhelmed and the health of its large number of people with underlying illnesses, the elderly, children and pregnant women will be at risk,"" he said.
""Such consequences will not be accepted by our people, nor will it be allowed to happen under the leadership of the Party and government,"" he said.
Upgraded measures needed
Ma also stressed the need to tailor disease control tool kits to cope with the current principle strain of Omicron that transmits in a faster and more covert way than the Delta strain, its predecessor.
Because a large proportion of Omicron cases are asymptomatic, China's monitoring defense against COVID-19 should be strengthened.
""In addition to fever sentinel clinics, mass screening of key groups and rapid reports, we should make full use of the rapid and convenient antigen tests and integrate the method with nucleic acid testing,"" he said.
As the fast-spreading Omicron can lead to a spike in new cases in a short period, Ma said the shortage of quarantine sites and temporary hospitals - the most acute problem at the moment - must be addressed.
Only when sufficient isolation facilities are provided and when all asymptomatic and mild patients are admitted into makeshift hospitals will we be able to effectively control Omicron outbreaks while guaranteeing smooth and consistent provision of normal medical services, he said.
To further relieve burden on healthcare systems, Ma requires the timely triage of COVID-19 patients. He clarifies that people who show pneumonia symptoms, suffer chronic diseases, the elderly and children should be admitted into designated hospitals.
""Mild and symptom-free cases should be received by makeshift hospitals and recovered patients should return home for self-isolation, so as to prevent them from taking up daily hospital resources,"" he said.
In the meantime, Ma stressed that heightened attention should be given to meet normal medication and healthcare demands of the people.
""General hospitals, children's hospitals and maternal and child care health centers should provide regular services as usual (during a local outbreak),"" he said, adding that special channels in locked-down areas should be provided for people in need and that those with chronic diseases or in critical conditions should be arranged to go to a hospital.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); COMMUNISM (79%); ISOLATION & QUARANTINE (78%); SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLE (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (77%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (77%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (77%); VIRUSES (77%); NEGATIVE NEWS (76%); VULNERABLE ADULTS (75%); SENIOR CITIZENS (74%); VULNERABLE HEALTH POPULATIONS (74%); WOMEN'S HEALTH (73%); CHILDREN (70%); BUSINESS NEWS (69%); POLITICAL PARTIES (66%); PREGNANCY & CHILDBIRTH (60%); SHORTAGES (50%)"

Measures have been implemented in the Pudong New Area in Shanghai to protect students attending the ongoing college entrance exams and the high school entrance exams to be held next week, as a locally transmitted COVID-19 case has been found in the area, according to local authorities.
The city reported one locally transmitted COVID-19 confirmed case outside of quarantine and lockdown communities on Friday. The Kangqiao Town in Pudong New Area, the residential neighborhood of the case, was listed as a high-risk area.
So far, 137 exam candidates are from high- and medium-risk areas in the region, Yan Bo, vice governor of the Area, said at a press conference on Friday. Those under centralized quarantine or with abnormal nucleic acid results took the exams at designated test sites.
Yan noted the prevention and control measures guarantee smooth transport on students' way to exam sites, and have closed-loop management and personnel transfer at emergencies related to COVID-19 before and during the exams.
A total of 81 designated nucleic acid sampling sites have offered services to all exam candidates who were required to take two nucleic acid tests within three days before the exam, according to Yan. Those living in medium- and high-risk areas can enjoy door-to-door testing services according to their needs, he said.

Houston resident Julie Joe has been suspecting that she might have already had caught COVID-19, although she didn't have a positive test to prove it. Her middle-school daughter has had flu like symptoms a couple of times since the spring semester began and she herself felt somewhat sick following her daughter's episodes.
She might be right to assume so because new findings released Tuesday by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggest that 6 out of 10 adult Americans &mdash; almost 200 million &mdash; and 3 in 4 children have had COVID-19 infections. That far exceeds the 80.8 million cases officially tallied by the CDC as of Tuesday.
The rate of previous infection was even higher among children, at 75 percent among those 11 years old and under. The level was much lower, around 33 percent, among those over 65.
The study's authors estimated ""seroprevalence"" caused by a prior infection &mdash; the presence of antibodies against the virus &mdash; based on samples gathered from thousands of routine blood draws from around the country.
""We know that the reported cases are just the tip of the iceberg,"" said Dr Kristie Clarke, co-lead for the CDC's COVID-19 Epidemiology and Surveillance Taskforce Seroprevalence Team, during a press briefing on Tuesday.
Cases can go undetected if people don't develop symptoms, don't get tested, or use at-home rapid tests that aren't reported to public health officials. Forthcoming CDC research estimates there actually may be three people infected for every case officially reported during the Omicron variant wave, Clarke added, suggesting that millions of cases were missed as the highly contagious variant spread.
The seroprevalence study by CDC is a repeated and cross-sectional national survey that estimates the proportion of the population in 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico that has infection-induced antibodies to COVID-19 between September 2021 and February 2022.
More than 200,000 blood samples were analyzed for virus-fighting antibodies anti-nucleocapsid (anti-N) made from infections, not the vaccines, during the study. It found out that prior to December last year, the seroprevalence increase rate was less than 2 percent every four weeks.
Between December 2021 to February 2022, when Omicron was spreading, seroprevalence increased from around 45 percent to 75 percent among children age o-17. That means 30 percent of the young population was infected in three months.
Seroprevalence from December to February increased from 36.5 percent to 63.7 percent among adults aged 18-49 years old. That ratio is lower for older people &mdash; it reached roughly 50 percent among people ages 50-64 and 33 percent among those age 65 or older.
""These findings illustrate a high infection rate for the Omicron variant, especially among children,"" the CDC said.
The CDC cautioned that the findings in its report are subject to some limitations. All samples were obtained for clinical testing and might overrepresent persons with greater healthcare access or who more frequently seek care.
The findings might underestimate the cumulative number of coronavirus infections because those after vaccination might result in lower anti-N titers that cannot account for reinfections.
CDC officials warned that having previously been infected doesn't necessarily mean that someone is protected going forward, given that immunity can wane over time. The CDC says vaccination remains the safest strategy for preventing COVID-19 complications and recommends vaccination for all eligible persons, including those with previous infections.
Also on Tuesday, US Vice President Kamala Harris tested positive for COVID-19, a spokesperson said in a statement.
Harris has exhibited no symptoms and has not been a close contact to President Joe Biden, Harris' press secretary Kirsten Allen said.

Lifting of measures, 'let it rip' approach see surge in fresh infections, deaths
No one in Australia talks about the COVID-19 pandemic anymore. It no longer dominates the news and has hardly received a mention during the general election campaign.
Public health measures such as lockdowns, social distancing, quarantine and contact tracing－measures applied to suppress the pandemic over the past two years－have been quietly removed, to the relief of the business community.
Much of this happened in the run-up to Christmas, as the Delta and Omicron strains were taking hold. The numbers of infections and deaths have since skyrocketed, even with one of the world's highest vaccination rates.
Despite the surge in cases, most state premiers have been determined to hold the line, allowing the virus to circulate in their communities, which critics have labeled the ""let it rip"" approach.
According to data from Johns Hopkins University Center for Systems Science and Engineering, the number of COVID-19 deaths in Australia totaled 7,926 as of early Wednesday. The number of cases was 6.76 million.
Western Australia, the last state in the Commonwealth to hold out against opening its borders, finally did so on March 3. Case numbers have risen from a few hundred daily to 25,000 daily cases as of Sunday.
Nationwide in January, 1,519 COVID-19 deaths were reported－49 a day, making it the leading cause of death in Australia, ahead of ischemic heart disease. A report by the Australian Bureau of Statistics revealed that there were 2,865 excess deaths, or 22.1 percent more than the historical average, in that month.
Exhausted medics
Health and eldercare workers are exhausted. Teachers are exhausted. Employers are finding it difficult to fill positions as workers self-isolate after contracting the virus.
General practitioners who have been on the front line of the pandemic response are now on the front line of the cleanup. There is two years' worth of missed checkups, delayed tests and mental health concerns.
Professor Catherine Bennett, chair of epidemiology at Deakin University in Queensland, told China Daily: ""As we cannot stop exposure (to the virus), it is important we learn more about who is still getting very sick with their infections, and whether there are ways we can prevent that.""
She urged looking at ""how easily people can access antivirals and if certain subgroups are more vulnerable and need better information or support"".
""With the virus here to stay, it's critical we keep working to reduce its burden and the deaths associated with it as much as we can,"" she said.
The case numbers since the start of the year have risen due to several factors, including the relaxing of restrictions, more transmissible variants with immune-evading capacities, waning immunity, fatigue in the population, and seasonal factors, according to Hassan Vally, associate professor in epidemiology at Deakin University.
""Importantly, however, we have an impressive vaccination coverage. And despite vaccine immunity waning, the vaccines hold up very well in terms of protecting against severe disease.""
Vally said the future lies in targeting interventions to protect the most vulnerable and to make changes to society and the built environment, such as improving ventilation, to mitigate the spread of COVID-19.
Professor Adrian Esterman, chair of biostatistics and epidemiology at the University of South Australia, said he felt governments around Australia had stopped listening to public health advice.
""The majority of Australians just want the COVID-19 epidemic to be over, and our leaders are telling us it is over.
""As Jon Snow said in Game of Thrones, 'Winter is coming.' The flu season is on us, and laboratory confirmed cases are rising rapidly in Australia.

After 32 days in treatment, Ye Ming, 108, recovered from COVID-19 and was discharged from Shanghai Pudong Hospital on Saturday, setting a record for the oldest person to recover from a severe infection across China.
According to a People's Daily report, Ye, who has a history of stroke, coronary heart disease and other medical issues, was weak when he was first hospitalized.
To better treat the elderly patient, the hospital directed experts and nursing teams - including those specializing in cardiology, geriatrics, respiratory medicine and traditional Chinese medicine - to focus more on him. He was transferred to the intensive care unit due to his critical condition and underlying illnesses, it said.
Thanks to the premium care and comprehensive treatment, Ye had tested negative in two consecutive nucleic acid tests at least 24 hours apart by Saturday, which meant he could be discharged from the hospital, according to the report.
About two weeks ago, Wang Manru, a 93-year-old woman, also recovered from COVID-19 and was discharged from a makeshift hospital in the Lingang area of Shanghai.
Coincidentally, both Ye and Wang worked at the Shanghai No 3 People's Hospital many years ago, and they worked together to provide medical assistance in the War to Resist US Aggression and Aid Korea (1950-53).
At a recent ceremony held by the makeshift hospital to celebrate Wang's recovery, the retired nurse showed an old photo that included herself and Ye to medics. She said she was really impressed with Ye, who was an anesthesiologist.
""After all, there were only three people in the first batch of medical workers from the Shanghai No 3 People's Hospital helping during the war,"" recalled Wang, who dedicated her life to pediatric care after she returned from the war until she retired.
People's Daily reported that Ye also contributed to the War of Resistance Against Japanese Aggression (1931-45), adding that he helped collect medicine and medical equipment for soldiers at that time.
At a news conference on Sunday, Zhao Dandan, deputy director of the Shanghai Health Commission, said he wished for Ye and Wang to recover quickly, pointing out their heroic efforts for the country.
Since the city was hit by the current epidemic in March, officials have prioritized providing comprehensive medical treatment and paying extra attention to elderly COVID-19 patients, especially those with severe infections, to alleviate their existing health conditions while treating them with antiviral therapies.
Medical teams have been required to increase their monitoring of such patients in the early stages and intervene as soon as possible to prevent a mild case from developing into a severe one, said Wu Qianyu, a health commission official.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (89%); LEVELS OF CARE (89%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (89%); SENIOR CITIZENS (89%); CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (78%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (78%); INTENSIVE CARE UNITS (78%); MEDICAL TREATMENTS & PROCEDURES (78%); PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS (78%); CARDIOLOGY (77%); GERIATRICS (77%); HEART DISEASE (77%); MEDICAID (77%); MEDICAL DEVICES (77%); NURSES & NURSING (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH (77%); ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (73%); PRESS CONFERENCES (73%); WAR & CONFLICT (71%); TRENDS & EVENTS (70%)

144 deaths also recorded as city official calls for unity at 'height of the epidemic'
Hong Kong reported a record 56,827 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday as the government called for united efforts to battle the city's worst outbreak.
It also recorded 144 deaths related to COVID-19. Only 20 of the deceased had received at least one vaccine shot. There were also 42 deaths that were not reported earlier due to information delays.
""While we are at the height of the epidemic, we must remain united and, with the support of the government, we can win in this fifth wave,"" Chui Tak-yi, undersecretary for food and health, told the daily news briefing.
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government said on Thursday that fighting against the pandemic was the overriding mission of all civil servants, regardless of the departments they belong to.
Staff members of 39 departments under eight bureaus are engaged in small-scale lockdown operations, according to the government.
In the past three days, over 30 such operations, involving COVID-19 tests for tens of thousands of residents, were carried out.
Retired chief inspector of police Luk Hoi-ho lent a hand at the front line of the ""silent war"". Luk and 500 others, mostly retired members of the city's disciplined forces, helped residents in these small-scale lockdown areas get registered and delivered supplies.
""We understand how heavy the burden is for people fighting against the pandemic on the front line, like medical workers, and we felt it is the responsibility of people like us－who have time and the relevant skills－to come to help,"" Luk said.
""Every day is an unforgettable memory. We are fighting a silent war against an invisible enemy.""
About 1,000 government employees were deployed to answer calls on a 24-hour telephone hotline to provide assistance to residents in distress, including confirmed patients and those under home quarantine.
While the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau is planning this month's scheduled mass testing program, staff members of the Civil Service Bureau are leaving no stones unturned to find venues for vaccination.

The government said that from April 1, civil servants wishing to enter government buildings will need to have had two shots of COVID-19 vaccine.
Leading a team of mainland health experts in Hong Kong, Liang Wannian, head of the COVID-19 response expert panel under mainland's National Health Commission, said they are still analyzing the current pandemic situation and will discuss relevant issues with Hong Kong experts before coming up with any suggestions.
He said he is confident about Hong Kong's ability to overcome the pandemic, noting its high-quality medical resources and good governance.
With the central government's help, the strong leadership of the SAR government, the united efforts of all sectors and the city's solid experience in combating severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, Hong Kong will surely win this battle, Liang reassured residents.
The overriding mission is to reduce transmission, infections and severe cases. The limited resources and attention should be focused on high-risk groups, places and organizations, Liang said.

144 deaths also recorded as city official calls for unity at 'height of the epidemic'
Hong Kong reported a record 56,827 new COVID-19 cases on Thursday as the government called for united efforts to battle the city's worst outbreak.
It also recorded 144 deaths related to COVID-19. Only 20 of the deceased had received at least one vaccine shot. There were also 42 deaths that were not reported earlier due to information delays.
""While we are at the height of the epidemic, we must remain united and, with the support of the government, we can win in this fifth wave,"" Chui Tak-yi, undersecretary for food and health, told the daily news briefing.
The Hong Kong Special Administrative Region government said on Thursday that fighting against the pandemic was the overriding mission of all civil servants, regardless of the departments they belong to.
Staff members of 39 departments under eight bureaus are engaged in small-scale lockdown operations, according to the government.
In the past three days, over 30 such operations, involving COVID-19 tests for tens of thousands of residents, were carried out.
Retired chief inspector of police Luk Hoi-ho lent a hand at the front line of the ""silent war"". Luk and 500 others, mostly retired members of the city's disciplined forces, helped residents in these small-scale lockdown areas get registered and delivered supplies.
""We understand how heavy the burden is for people fighting against the pandemic on the front line, like medical workers, and we felt it is the responsibility of people like us-who have time and the relevant skills-to come to help,"" Luk said.
""Every day is an unforgettable memory. We are fighting a silent war against an invisible enemy.""
About 1,000 government employees were deployed to answer calls on a 24-hour telephone hotline to provide assistance to residents in distress, including confirmed patients and those under home quarantine.
While the Constitutional and Mainland Affairs Bureau is planning this month's scheduled mass testing program, staff members of the Civil Service Bureau are leaving no stones unturned to find venues for vaccination. Current and some former members of the disciplined services have been mobilized to take up management duties at community isolation and treatment facilities.

China will dispatch its first international medical aid team specializing in traditional Chinese medicine to Cambodia to help the country fight COVID-19 and promote mutual communication in the field of traditional medicine, according to an agreement signed this week.
The team will be sent to the Cambodia-China Friendship Preah Kossamak Hospital in Phnom Penh for a year, Huang Luqi, deputy director of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, said during a signing ceremony in the Cambodian capital on Tuesday.
""During the period, the team will train medical professionals from Cambodia's Ministry of Health, develop targeted training manuals and courses, and provide prevention, treatment and rehabilitation services for common diseases, including COVID-19, for local people,"" Huang was quoted as saying in a report by Xinhua News Agency.
The deal was signed between Huang and Cambodian Health Minister Mam Bunheng. Wang Wentian, the Chinese ambassador to Cambodia, also attended the ceremony.
Cambodians are already used to treating common illnesses with TCM, and such therapies have also been deployed in the battle against COVID-19, Mam Bunheng said.
He added that the new deal will not only help increase the COVID-19 treatment capacity of Cambodian medical experts, but also broaden cooperation in the traditional medicine field.
Cambodia is one of an increasing number of countries that have granted market approval or licenses to Lianhua Qingwen capsules, a TCM widely used to treat mild COVID-19 patients. Cambodian media reported in July that the medicine was selected as part of a home-based treatment for people showing mild COVID-19 symptoms, such as a runny nose or cough.
China has accelerated efforts to advance the recognition and adoption of TCM around the globe in recent years, especially after a number of TCM drugs proved effective in relieving COVID-19 symptoms.
Last week, Huang met with Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, director-general of the World Health Origination, to discuss TCM's role in improving people's health.
Huang handed Tedros a research report that assessed the safety and efficacy of TCM in fighting COVID-19 with an evidence-based approach, the administration said.
China aims to markedly increase the discourse power and influence of TCM globally by 2035, according to a development plan released by the administration and the administrative office of the Leading Group for Promoting the Belt and Road Initiative on Jan 15.
From last year to 2025, the country plans to cooperate with foreign countries involved in the initiative to establish 30 TCM centers overseas, 50 collaboration centers and a batch of TCM export service bases.","ALTERNATIVE MEDICINE (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); AGREEMENTS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (78%); SAFETY (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (75%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (73%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (73%); PROFESSIONAL WORKERS (73%); REPORTS, REVIEWS & SECTIONS (73%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (69%); RESEARCH REPORTS (62%); BUSINESS REPORTS & FORECASTS (53%)"

Shanghai reported three new locally transmitted COVID-19 confirmed cases and four asymptomatic cases on Wednesday, with all of them being close contacts of the local case that was reported on Tuesday.
The seven new cases - all women aged between 58 and 66 - and the 56-year-old case reported on Tuesday are from the same amateur dancing troupe that gathers regularly at the Shiquan Community Cultural Activity Center on Ningqiang Road in Putuo district, which was classified as medium-risk area on Tuesday.
Wu Jinglei, director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission, said that the seven women tested positive during hotel quarantine and are all in stable condition.
As of 4 pm Wednesday, 165 close contacts, 543 secondary close contacts, and more than 87,000 individuals related to the cases have been identified and subjected to related quarantine and control measures.
""Preliminary sequencing tests have indicated that the case reported on Tuesday has the Omicron variant,"" said Wu.
The city's health authority on Wednesday reiterated the importance of being vaccinated against COVID-19.
As of Tuesday, nearly 22.5 million residents in Shanghai had received two doses of the vaccine, and more than 11 million had received their booster shots.",COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); VACCINES (90%); ISOLATION & QUARANTINE (78%); WOMEN (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (72%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (69%); DANCE (56%)

Africa is experiencing a surge in outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases like measles, polio and yellow fever due to disruption of routine immunization caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, according to the World Health Organization.
Speaking in a virtual news briefing on Thursday, Benido Impouma, director of communicable and non-communicable diseases in the WHO regional office for Africa, said the continent reported almost 17,500 cases of measles between January and March, translating to a 400 percent increase compared with the same period last year.
He said 24 countries confirmed outbreaks of a variant of polio last year, which was four times more than in 2020.
Additionally, 13 countries reported new yellow fever outbreaks in the African region last year, compared to nine in 2020 and three in 2019.
""This week, we are marking African vaccination week into the context of two years of disruption by COVID-19 pandemic that has had major effect on provision of routine health services with immunization being seriously affected,"" Impouma said.
""Inequalities in accessing vaccines, disruptions by the COVID-19 pandemic, including its huge strain on health system capacities, impaired routine immunization services in many African countries and forced suspension of vaccination drives.""
He said tens of millions of people in the coastal regions are still missing out on the scheduled immunization against preventable diseases.
Helen Rees, the executive director of Wits Reproductive Health and HIV Institute at the South Africa's University of Witwatersrand, said whenever routine immunizations coverage stops, outbreaks are witnessed.
""We recognize with COVID-19 that if we allow the pandemic to go rampant as it managed to do...... it's not only a health issue but has a huge impact on human development, economies, job creation and poverty,"" she said.
""The same is true for routine immunization as for COVID-19, there is a direct health mortality problem but there is a spinoff in terms of adversely affecting core-development and contributing to poverty which is absolutely critical for our region.""
Messeret Shibeshi, an epidemiologist from the WHO, said health measures like lockdowns imposed during the early days of COVID-19 pandemic compromised essential services like provision of scheduled vaccinations
""Many countries in our region have really lapsed in their coverage against measles. Very few sustained their expected coverage. Due to missed vaccinations, children are now susceptible to the outbreaks,"" she said.
""We call on our member states to ensure that those children who have missed their scheduled vaccinations should be given their vaccines, that's the only way to prevent the measles outbreak.""
Countries are expected to attain and maintain measles vaccination coverage of 95 percent with two doses to reach measles elimination.
According to the WHO and the United Nations Children's Fund estimates, while in 2019, six countries in the African region attained 95 percent coverage with first dose measles vaccination, only three met this target in 2020.
To urgently scale up coverage and protect children, Impouma said WHO and partners are supporting African countries to carry out catch-up routine vaccination campaigns.
He said more than 30 African countries have implemented at least one catch-up immunization campaigns in the second half of last year and this year countries are showing progress with measles and yellow fever campaigns.
Impouma said Central Africa Republic, Chad, Equatorial Guinea, Ethiopia, Nigeria, Somalia and South Sudan have reinstated measles campaigns.
He said some countries have successfully integrated other critical immunization campaigns with COVID-19 vaccination.
For example, Ghana integrated COVID-19 vaccination with yellow fever campaigns in December to curb an outbreak that erupted a month earlier.
Additionally, Nigeria recently launched a vaccine scale-up strategy which guides the integration of routine immunization with COVID-19 vaccination for mothers and their babies.",VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (92%); VACCINES (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); MEASLES (90%); MOSQUITO BORNE DISEASES (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); TROPICAL DISEASES (90%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (89%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (77%); NEGATIVE NEWS (77%); SEXUAL & REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH (77%); EXECUTIVES (76%); ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES & WORKERS (72%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (72%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (71%); RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS (71%); UNITED NATIONS (71%); EMPLOYMENT GROWTH (70%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (61%); JOB CREATION (50%)

China approved on Wednesday the use of a monoclonal neutralizing antibody cocktail for COVID-19 treatment created by Brii Biosciences, making it the first antibody combination therapy against the disease to get the green light in the country.
The medicine－a combination of the amubarvimab and romlusevimab antibodies, previously known as BRII-196 and BRII-198－has been approved to treat mild COVID-19 cases and moderate cases with a high risk of progressing to hospitalization or death, according to the National Medical Products Administration.
It can be used on adults and on minors ages 12 to 17 who weigh at least 40 kilograms. Since June, nearly 900 patients in China have undergone the treatment to quell local outbreaks from Liaoning to Guangdong province, according to the company.
Brii Biosciences has also filed an emergency use application for the medicine in the United States. The antibody cocktail was jointly developed by Brii Biosciences, Tsinghua University, and the Third People's Hospital of Shenzhen, Guangdong province.
The National Medical Products Administration approved the medicine based on positive final and interim results from phase 3 clinical trials on 847 patients sponsored by the United States National Institutes of Health, the company said.
The final results showed the therapy has a good safety profile and can reduce the risk of hospitalization and death by 80 percent. The study was conducted around the world, including in the US, Brazil, South Africa, Mexico, Argentina and the Philippines.
In vitro lab tests suggest that the antibody combination can be effective against common SARS-CoV-2 variants, including the Alpha, Beta, Delta, Lambda and Mu. Testing with the newer Omicron strain is ongoing.
Rogers Luo, Brii Biosciences president and general manager in China, called the antibody cocktail's approval an ""important milestone"".
""As a startup multinational biotech company co-located in China and the US, we are working to advance access to this treatment for a broad range of COVID-19 patients in China, while also scaling our effort to match the need for COVID-19 treatment options to combat the pandemic,"" he said.
Luo said on his social media account that the antibody cocktail represented a breakthrough in finding another therapeutic option for COVID-19. ""We now have a strong weapon against the pandemic in hand, and it is only a matter of time before we can snare the dragon,"" he said.
Zhang Linqi, a key scientist in developing the antibody cocktail and a professor at Tsinghua University's School of Medicine, said the treatment is the only one of its kind to have confirmed clinical efficacy among patients infected by SARS-CoV-2 variants in premarket trials.
""The antibody combination provides world-class treatment for China to fight the COVID-19 epidemic,"" he said.
Zhang said they will continue to evaluate the treatment among the immunocompromised population as a preventive measure.
Monoclonal antibody treatment uses man-made antibodies that bind to the critical region of the spike protein of the COVID-19 virus to interfere with the pathogen's ability to attach to and enter cells, according to the World Health Organization.
The technology has the potential for large-scale production because scientists can mass produce antibodies in labs, and it can be highly effective against mild and moderate COVID-19 cases and help patients recover faster.
Given their potential as lifesaving medicine, more than 70 monoclonal antibodies were in development for the treatment and prevention of COVID-19 as of June, with support from many big pharma companies, such as Eli Lilly, AstraZeneca, Regeneron and GlaxoSmithKline.
However, monoclonal antibody cocktails are very expensive because of their limited production, and they typically must be administered intravenously in a hospital setting. In the US, a single dose of Regeneron's antibody infusion cost $1,250 as of August, prompting the WHO to encourage governments and companies to make such treatments more accessible.
Another challenge is that monoclonal antibodies tend to latch onto highly specific targets, raising the risk of the treatment losing its efficacy if the COVID-19 virus were to substantially change its spike protein through multiple mutations, such as in the Omicron variant.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); APPROVALS (90%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (90%); HEALTH CARE RATIONING (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH (89%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (86%); CLINICAL TRIALS (78%); SAFETY (78%); BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY (77%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (77%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (73%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (73%); RESEARCH REPORTS (73%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (66%); INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS (65%)

Dongguan, Guangdong province, has reported eight confirmed locally transmitted COVID-19 cases as of Monday, officials said on Thursday afternoon at a news briefing.
The city reported four additional cases on Thursday, with three people identified as having had close contact with the first two asymptomatic carriers and the other identified during testing of residents in Dalang township.
Dongguan conducted citywide testing and a second round of test for residents on Wednesday in Dalang, where the first two cases were reported on Monday, according to Lai Shaoyu, deputy secretary-general of the Dongguan city government.
As of 2 pm on Thursday, all test samples were negative, Lai said.
Dongguan has introduced strict traffic controls requiring residents and visitors leaving the city to present negative nucleic acid test results obtained within 48 hours.
Eight areas of Dalang township, including residential communities and industrial zones have been changed from the low-risk to medium-risk level, Lai said.",

While the number of COVID-19 infection cases and deaths continue to decline across Africa, a development that has seen countries relax restrictions to allow economic recovery, the World Health Organization and the Africa Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have warned the continent against complacency.
John Nkengasong, the director of Africa CDC, expressed concerns that the number of testing across the continent has decreased significantly.
""We should not be less vigilant. We cannot be complacent. Testing is the cornerstone for us to continue to fight this pandemic so I urge all the African Union member states to increase rather than decrease the testing,"" he said at a virtual briefing on Thursday.
Nkengasong said increased testing would enable countries to pick the hotspots and deal with the pandemic effectively.
""The pandemic is not over, this is just a low transmission season. We should use this season to increase vaccine uptake, testing, surveillance and engaging the community with the right messaging,"" he said.
According to the WHO, Africa is experiencing its longest-running decline in COVID-19 infections since the onset of the pandemic, with the recorded weekly infection COVID-19 cases having fallen for the past 16 weeks and deaths having dropped for the last eight weeks.
The UN agency said COVID-19 infections largely due to the Omicron-driven fourth pandemic wave have reduced from a peak of over 308, 000 cases weekly at the start of the year to less than 20, 000 in the week ending April 10.
Over the past week, Africa recorded around 18, 000 infection cases and 239 deaths, translating to a decline of 29 percent and 37 percent, respectively, compared with the previous week, the agency said.
Matshidiso Moeti, the WHO regional director for Africa, said despite the decreasing infections, it is crucial that countries remain vigilant and maintain surveillance measures, including genomic surveillance to swiftly detect circulating COVID-19 variants, enhance testing and scale up vaccination.
""With the virus still circulating, the risk of new and potentially more deadly variants emerging remains, and the pandemic control measures are pivotal to effective response to a surge in infections,"" she said.
The WHO warned of a high risk of another wave of new infections, with the cold season approaching in the southern hemisphere in June through August.
""Africa's previous pandemic waves have often coincided with lower temperatures when people mostly stay indoors and often in poorly ventilated spaces,"" the UN agency said.
So far Africa has fully vaccinated 16.2 percent of its population, with 10 AU member states having vaccinated more than 35 percent of their populations, Africa CDC data indicates.
On vaccine manufacturing, Nkengasong appreciated that many countries across the continent are now engaging on local manufacturing of COVID-19 vaccines.
He, however, decried that South Africa's Aspen Pharmacare, which was licensed in December to produce Johnson and Johnson COVID-19 vaccines, has not received any order.
""The risk is high that the company may stop producing the vaccines. This is an appeal to the international community and the entire continent that we must rally our efforts and support the company,"" Nkengasong said.
""Regional manufacturing of vaccines is an indisputable pathway to guarantee collective health security. It has to be a deliberate effort to support shaping of the market so that vaccines produced in Africa are purchased adequately so that we maintain vaccine manufacturing capacity.""
He partly attributed the situation to the fact that many African countries are currently receiving a lot of vaccine donations hence don't see the need to purchase more doses.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); EPIDEMICS (90%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (90%); SURVEILLANCE (89%); VACCINES (89%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (77%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (77%); PREVENTION & WELLNESS (77%); UNITED NATIONS (77%); BIOLOGICS MFG (72%); ECONOMIC RECOVERY (72%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (72%); BIOTECHNOLOGY INSTRUMENTS MFG (69%); BIOTECHNOLOGY & GENETIC SCIENCE (68%)

Shanghai on Friday began mass testing in areas deemed to have low risk of COVID-19 exposure so as to identify potential infections, according the municipal health authorities. The mass testing will last till Sunday.
The closed-loop management system will not be imposed in these areas, Wu Jinglei, director of the Shanghai Municipal Health Commission said at a briefing on Friday.
The city announced this broader measurement to control the spread of COVID-19 after 260 new locally transmitted infections - 203 of whom were asymptomatic - were reported on Thursday.

Officials and medical experts from home and abroad have called for international cooperation in pandemic prevention and control, and highlighted the use of traditional Chinese medicine in the treatment of COVID-19.
They were speaking on Tuesday to the Taihu World Cultural Forum in Bengbu, Anhui province.
Yukio Hatoyama, a former Japanese prime minister, said that given the current international situation, the world must take effective measures to deal with the pandemic, achieve economic recovery and maintain global stability.
""The international situation, including relations between major powers, is full of uncertainties and has witnessed the rise of a 'my country first' sentiment,"" Hatoyama said via a video link.
""The (novel) coronavirus, which is rampant around the world, is a challenge facing mankind. All countries must work together to ensure that all people can have access to prevention and control measures, including vaccination and new drugs to treat COVID-19.""
He said the world should embrace different forms of civilization and achieve peace and development, adding that the establishment of a community with a shared future for mankind will change the current international situation.
Kim Seung-ho, the Republic of Korea's consul general in Shanghai, said the core of pandemic response is collaboration, not competition.
""At the early stage of the outbreak, which is the most critical time in the prevention of infectious diseases, efforts against COVID-19 were abruptly politicized. The name of the country where the COVID-19 virus happened to break out was called and fingers pointed, despite its sacrificial efforts,"" Kim said.
""The glasses of politicization and competition hampered us from learning from some countries' best practices and from legitimately appreciating those countries' contributions in the global battle against COVID-19.""
He said the components of the ""societal vaccine"" for pandemics should be: no politicization; no selfishness; no competition; and no fragmentation, combined with concerted efforts. He added that appropriate measures in the initial stage, social trust, and technology were also essential.
""In his New Year address, President Xi stated that the world is both a single community sharing the same destiny, and simply put, one family,"" Kim said.
""As long as we stand united like one family, we are immune to any virus, no matter how contagious and devastating it is.
""Unity is the name of the 'vaccine' for international society against any pandemic. United we win, divided we lose.""
Yu Wenming, director of the National Administration of Traditional Chinese Medicine, stressed the importance of building a global community of health for all, and the use of TCM in treating COVID-19 patients in China.
President Xi Jinping first proposed the concept of building a global community of health for all in March last year in a message to French President Emmanuel Macron.
""TCM has been used in the treatment of 90 percent of the (COVID-19) patients in China. By last year, the country had established more than 72,300 health institutions specializing in TCM. The medicine has spread to 196 countries and regions, and more than 40 countries have signed cooperation agreements on TCM with China,"" Yu said.

Disease specialists have urged the authorities to prepare for a so-called twindemic this winter, where COVID-19 and seasonal influenza outbreaks could increase pressure on health services and cause additional deaths.
The term twindemic - which is a portmanteau of ""twin"" and ""pandemic"" - was coined last year, when experts first warned of the dual threats of flu and the novel coronavirus.
Flu outbreaks were, in fact, kept to historically low levels last winter in many parts of the world, most likely due to COVID-19 lockdowns, the wearing of masks, hand washing, and social distancing.
But experts are sounding the alarm again in the wake of many governments loosening COVID-19 restrictions.
""We are likely to see the flu for the first time in any real numbers, co-circulating with COVID-19,"" Jenny Harries, chief executive of the United Kingdom Health Security Agency, told Sky News. ""The risks of catching both together still remain. And if you do that, then early evidence suggests that you are twice as likely to die from having two together, than just having COVID-19 alone.""
A 2020 Public Health England hospital study of seriously ill patients found 43 percent of people with both flu and COVID-19 died, compared to 27 percent of those who tested positive for COVID-19 alone. Of patients in the study who only had the flu, 4.8 percent died.
Last week, the United States Centers for Disease Control, or CDC, warned that the US was at risk of a severe flu season, since the mild flu season last winter may have led to reduced immunity in the general population.
""This low flu activity was likely due to the widespread implementation of COVID-19 preventive measures, like masks, physical distancing, and staying home,"" CDC Director Rochelle Walensky said in a briefing on flu vaccination efforts.
""I get it, we are all tired of talking about vaccines,"" Walensky added, before noting it had become ""doubly important"" to seek treatment as ""we are preparing for the return of the flu"".
The UK government launched a new television commercial last week urging people who are eligible for free flu vaccines and COVID-19 boosters to book their shots ahead of the colder months.
The government said the 2021/22 flu campaign will be the ""biggest in history"" and that it anticipates the flu will pose a far larger threat this year.
""Not many people got flu last year because of COVID-19 restrictions, so there isn't as much natural immunity in our communities as usual,"" said England's deputy chief medical officer, Jonathan Van-Tam. ""We will see flu circulating this winter; it might be higher than usual and that makes it a significant public health concern.""",COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); INFLUENZA (92%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (89%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); FACE MASK MANDATES (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (89%); VACCINES (89%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); DEATH & DYING (77%); CORONAVIRUSES (72%); VIRUSES (72%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (71%); EXECUTIVES (66%)

COVID-19 outbreaks in China have eased recently, with newly added daily infections below 1,200 for the past week and regions with infections further narrowing, a senior health official said on Monday.
Lei Zhenglong, deputy director of the National Health Commission's Bureau of Disease Prevention and Control, said the outbreak in Shanghai is improving and daily infections have remained below 1,000 for eight days.
However, there is great pressure to prevent a resurgence, and in certain areas and communities, the epidemic situation is still volatile, he said at a news conference.
Meanwhile in Beijing, there are cluster infections and sporadic cases, and the risk of infection remains in certain areas and among key groups, Lei said.
The commission will continue to guide local authorities to take scientific and targeted epidemic control measures to contain outbreaks as soon as possible with minimal cost.
Commission spokesman Mi Feng said the number of confirmed and asymptomatic local cases in the country has dropped for 27 consecutive days, but there have been new cluster infections reported and the epidemic situation remains severe and complicated.
The country should continue to prevent imported cases and contain cluster infections more quickly, he said.
Nucleic acid tests should be available within a 15-minute walk in provincial capitals and cities with over 10 million people, he said.
COVID-19 vaccinations will continue, with a focus on the elderly, he added.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); PREVENTION & WELLNESS (77%); PRESS CONFERENCES (73%); VACCINES (73%)

A new study by researchers at the University of Oxford has suggested catching COVID-19 may lead to changes to the brain.
It is as yet unclear if the changes are lasting, but magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans conducted before and after infection have shown that even in mild cases of infection, patients' brains have shrunk slightly. The tissue lost has particularly affected areas of the brain relating to memory and the sense of smell, which has been reduced in many patients throughout the pandemic.
""We were looking at essentially mild infection, so to see that we could really see some differences in their brain and how much their brain had changed compared with those who had not been infected was quite a surprise,"" the report's lead author, Gwenaelle Douaud, a professor working at Oxford's Wellcome Centre for Integrative Neuroimaging, told the BBC.
The findings of the team's study are published in the journal Nature. It benefitted from the findings of a pre-existing long-term research project looking at the health of half a million people that the UK Biobank has been carrying out for more than a decade before the pandemic hit.
This allowed researchers to compare people's health before and after infection. It looked at 401 participants who had been infected, on average four and a half months after their infection, which in 96 percent of cases was regarded as mild, and compared their overall health with 384 people who had not been infected.
Among the differences noted were brain shrinkage of up to 2 percent. Another part of the study reported that people who had tested positive needed more time to complete a variety of cognitive tests, with researchers noting ""a significant, deleterious impact associated with COVID-19.
""Significantly greater cognitive decline, which persisted even after excluding the hospitalized patients, was seen in the COVID-19 positive group between the two time-points,"" the study said.
The brain is regarded as an organ with the ability to heal itself, so the lasting impact will require further studies, and it has been suggested that the reduction of brain size could be explained by cells dying off because of people losing their sense of smell after infection.
""Whether this deleterious impact can be partially reversed, or whether these effects will persist in the long term, remains to be investigated with additional follow-up,"" the report said.
It may also shine some light on the issue of long COVID, which some patients have experienced long after initial infection.
""These findings might help to explain why some people experience brain symptoms long after the acute infection,"" said research team member Max Taquet.
""The causes of these brain changes, whether they can be prevented or even reverted, as well as whether similar changes are observed in hospitalised patients, in children and younger adults, and in minority ethnic groups, remain to be determined.""",COLLEGES & UNIVERSITIES (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); DIAGNOSTIC IMAGING (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); RESEARCH REPORTS (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); BRAIN (78%); RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (78%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (78%); INTELLIGENCE & COGNITION (77%); MEMORY (77%); MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (76%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (72%); WRITERS (68%)

More than 5.29 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines had been administered in the Tibet autonomous region by the end of last month, regional health commission officials said recently.
The region has a population of more than 3.6 million and has now effectively completed the task of vaccinating all people age 18 and older.
In early last month, Tibet launched vaccinations for those aged between 12 and 17 and has met national goals, said Li Jingzhong, deputy Party secretary of the region's center for disease control and prevention, while addressing a news conference recently in Lhasa, the regional capital.
Based on the analysis of several recent outbreaks of COVID-19 in China, Li said the vaccine has a definite effect on the prevention of transmission, severe illness and death, so it's wise to be vaccinated.
""Having the vaccination does not mean that one is completely safe. Epidemic prevention measures are still necessary,"" he said.
Since mid-July, a new wave of COVID-19 has hit many parts of China. The Tibetan government has attached great importance to prevention and control work, deploying a series of strict measures that were taken immediately and effectively, he added.
Those include asking people to wear masks, scanning health codes, checking body temperatures and maintaining social distancing at crowded places like shopping malls, supermarkets, tourist sites and monasteries.
""Measures like temperature checks, possession of a negative nucleic acid test result within 48 hours and health and travel code inspections shall be undertaken for people entering Tibet from outside,"" Li said.
In addition, strict management of employees engaged in jobs like health monitoring and nucleic acid detection at cold chain cargo transportation sites, hospitals, airports and ports has also been strictly implemented.
Border control measures aimed at blocking any imported risks are also in place.
Tan Xiangdong, a senior official of the region's health commission, said that since the outbreak of the pandemic last year, the region has only had one confirmed case, and that patient was cured through intensive care and treatment.
""Thanks to the measures, there have been no new cases for the past 18 consecutive months,"" he said.",VACCINES (94%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (89%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (89%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (78%); PREVENTION & WELLNESS (77%); BORDER CONTROL (73%); PRESS CONFERENCES (73%); PUBLIC OFFICIALS (71%); DEATH & DYING (69%); TERRITORIAL & NATIONAL BORDERS (64%)

Health officials have called for ""swifter"" and ""more targeted"" efforts to enforce the 20 optimization measures of the COVID-19 containment policy released last week as China finds itself tacking a surge of Omicron-fueled cases.
Previously, China traced and isolated not only ""close contacts"" of confirmed cases, but also those secondary contacts with close contacts. In addition, places used to be labeled as low-, medium- or high-risk areas in the previous three-tier system based on infection hazards.
However, the ""secondary close contacts"" will no longer be designated or quarantined under the new rules, and the ""medium-risk region"" label has been retired. Furthermore, high-risk places are now designated as smaller areas such as residential buildings rather than entire communities or districts.
Shen Hongbing, director of the National Disease Prevention and Control Bureau, said the change helps make the most of epidemic control resources such as contact tracing and isolation venues.
Some places tend to overly enforce the rules and had managed the less risky group as if they were close contacts, which is ""unnecessary"", he told a news conference on Thursday.
But Shen, also academician at Chinese Academy of Engineering, suggested that dropping the category does not make the control effort any easier. Instead, contact tracers need to move more quickly to locate and test close contacts.
""Once the close contacts test positive, they need to quickly trace their own close contacts,"" Shen said.
Wang Liping, a researcher with Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention, said: ""The designation of medium-risk places would put a sizable population under restriction, but the positive rate is rather low.""
With the label gone, control work needs to be more accurate and efficient, she said.
The new rules came as China works to curb oversimplicity in enforcing epidemic control measures and reduce their impact on people's lives.
Shen said the COVID-related complaints dropped 39 percent less than a week after the new rules were unveiled.
Among the complaints, one-fourth were about returnees from low-risk regions being told not to return or placed under isolation. Others centered on randomly enlarging the scale of restriction measures.",PUBLIC HEALTH (91%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (91%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (90%); DISEASE CONTACT TRACING (90%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); AGENCY RULEMAKING (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); EPIDEMICS (89%); DISEASE REPORTING (78%); PRESS CONFERENCES (73%)

Refrigerators and freezers have gained traction among Chinese consumers and have seen robust growth in sales, as people spend more time at home and purchase groceries in bulk due to a resurgence in domestic COVID-19 cases, industry experts said.
Statistics from All View Cloud, a Beijing-based consultancy specializing in home appliances, showed that online sales via freezers increased 46.6 percent year-on-year from March 28 to April 24, while sales of offline channels such as brick-and-mortar stores rose 28.3 percent on a yearly basis.
During this period, sales of freezers in Shanghai and Jilin province surged 220.4 percent and 124.1 percent year-on-year, respectively, amid the local lockdown to curb the spread of COVID-19, according to the consultancy.
""Consumers have shown surging demand for fresh foods including vegetables, fruit, milk, meat and frozen products when they are confined indoors and switch to online shopping due to the pandemic, which has given a big boost to sales of cold storage products,"" said Wang Lei, senior research manager of the home appliances business unit at AVC.
As a storage supplement to refrigerators, freezers have been favored by consumers given their small size and cost-effective features, Wang said, adding that since March, the sporadic resurgence of COVID-19 in some parts of the country has accelerated the upgrading and replacement of refrigerators and freezers.
Consumers' purchasing demand are likely to be unleashed, buoyed by the country's supportive policies such as tax and fee reduction, sending out consumption coupons, and promoting spending on home appliances in rural areas, Wang added.
Sales of refrigerators are expected to increase 3.8 percent year-on-year during the April-June period compared with the previous year, and the related revenue will go up by 6 percent year-on-year, according to AVC.
In addition, sales of refrigerators stood at 31.88 million units in 2021, down 2.1 percent on a yearly basis, while related revenue stood at 97.1 billion yuan ($15.2 billion), an increase of 7.9 percent year-on-year, said the consultancy. The freezer market raked in 12.3 billion yuan in total revenue last year, up 11.2 percent year-on-year, with sales climbing 8 percent to 9.22 million units.
The domestic home appliances market is expected to witness a recovery of growth in 2022, as the pandemic increasingly comes under better control along with the government's vigorous measures to spur consumption, experts said.
Noting that consumers are keen on buying freezers with larger storage space, Wang Xiaocheng, general manager of the refrigerator and washing machine sales unit at Chinese home appliances manufacturer Meiling, said enterprises should grasp this new wave of consumer demands and roll out more innovative freezer products.
""The surge in sales of refrigerators in some regions amid the pandemic will not last long, but people are pursuing healthier lifestyles and attaching huge importance to food safety, which will bring about new opportunities for bolstering the development of the refrigerator and freezer industry,"" said Han Dong, who is in charge of the sales of refrigerators and freezers in the domestic market at Ronshen, another home appliances maker.
In the long run, Chinese consumers' demands for freezers will continue to rise, Han said, adding an increasing number of people are likely to choose freezers as the second cold storage equipment for their families.
At present, growth in the domestic home appliances segment is slowing. Data from AVC showed China's home appliances sector in 2021 reached 760.3 billion yuan, up 3.6 percent year-on-year. However, this figure represented a drop of 7.4 percent compared with 2019.
This year's Government Work Report stated China will continue to encourage local governments to promote spending on green and smart home appliances in rural areas to replace old home appliances as part of a broader push to expand domestic demand and promote the sustained recovery of consumption.
Zhao Ping, deputy head of the Beijing-based Academy of China Council for the Promotion of International Trade, said the purchase of home appliances has become an important driving force in unleashing the potential of the domestic consumption market and stabilizing economic growth, along with the consumption upgrade.
Zhao noted the replacement of old home appliances with new ones will expand sales for home appliances makers, and promote the development of related industries, such as the recycling, dismantling and reuse of home appliances.
Liu Buchen, an independent researcher in the home appliances sector, said China's household appliance enterprises should abandon the low-quality and low-price competition strategy and make continuous innovations in the fields of technology, quality and design.",CONSUMERS (91%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); RETAIL SALES (90%); PANDEMICS (89%); ANNUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS (78%); CONSUMPTION (78%); SALES & SELLING (78%); INDUSTRY ANALYSTS (77%); BUSINESS FORECASTS (76%); INTERNET RETAILING (76%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (68%); PUBLIC POLICY (68%)

WHO says countries should not give 3rd jabs while poor nations wait for 1st
The World Health Organization, or WHO, has criticized the United Kingdom's decision to move ahead with a major, 33 million-dose COVID-19 vaccine booster campaign, saying the treatments should instead go to parts of the world with low coverage.
The UK will begin distributing third shots on Monday, as part of an effort to top up immunity among vulnerable groups, healthcare workers, and people aged 55 and older. All those receiving jabs will have had their second COVID-19 vaccinations at least six months earlier.
But David Nabarro, the WHO's special envoy for the global COVID-19 response, questioned the use of booster campaigns while billions of people around the globe are yet to receive a first treatment.
""I actually think that we should be using the scarce amounts of vaccine in the world today to make sure that everybody at risk, wherever they are, is protected,"" Nabarro told Sky News. ""So, why don't we just get this vaccine to where it's needed?""
The WHO had previously called on rich nations to suspend plans for booster campaigns this fall, in order to ensure supply is directed at low-income nations, where just 1.9 percent of people have received a first shot.
The UK has moved ahead with its booster campaign on the advice of advisory body the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunization. In a recently published COVID-19 response plan, the government said: ""There is early evidence that the levels of protection offered by COVID-19 vaccines reduce over time, particularly in older individuals who are at greater risk from the virus.""
A review published on Monday in medical journal The Lancet said the evidence so far does not support the need for booster jabs in the general population.
Penny Ward, a professor in pharmaceutical medicine at King's College London, said that, while the observed waning immunity among those vaccinated is low, a small difference is ""likely to translate into significant numbers of people needing hospital care for COVID-19"".
""By intervening now to boost protection against disease－as observed in the emerging data from the booster program in Israel－this risk should be reduced,"" Ward said.
She said the ""issue of global vaccine equity is separate to this decision"".
""The UK government has already contributed significantly to global health and to protecting overseas populations against COVID-19,"" she said. ""However, their first duty, as the government of a democratic nation, is to protect the health and wellbeing of the UK population they serve.""
Other commentators have argued that it is within rich nations' best interests to increase global vaccine coverage, in order to prevent the rise of new, more vaccine-resistant variants.
Michael Sheldrick, co-founder of the anti-poverty group Global Citizen, has called for the redistribution of 2 billion doses of vaccines to low-and middle-income regions by the end of the year.
""This can be done if countries don't reserve boosters for use now purely for precaution when we need to prevent the emergence of ever more dangerous variants in undervaccinated parts of the world, and ultimately end the pandemic everywhere,"" Sheldrick told China Daily in a previous interview.","VACCINES (94%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (90%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (77%); EPIDEMICS (77%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (77%); VIRUSES (77%); VULNERABLE ADULTS (77%); VULNERABLE HEALTH POPULATIONS (77%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (76%); SENIOR CITIZENS (73%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (70%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (70%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (60%)

Sporadic COVID-19 cases are continuing to emerge in more parts of China, with Ningbo, in East China's Zhejiang province, reporting three COVID-19 cases on Monday as the city launched stringent measures to fight the pandemic.
The three cases, all members of one family in Ningbo's Zhenhai district, have been sent to a designated hospital for treatment. Schools in the district were closed on Monday, the local authorities said, and all flights from Ningbo to Beijing were canceled due to pandemic prevention measures.
On Monday morning, the city imposed complete closed-off management on the residential community and businesses in Zhenhai's Jiaochuan subdistrict, where the three infected patients lived and worked.
All residents and workers in the area began receiving nucleic acid tests on Monday morning. A medical worker at the nucleic acid testing site in the community said 120 medical personnel arrived at the test site at 4 am on Monday to conduct nucleic acid tests on residents.
Most hospitals in the district suspended offline outpatient services due to COVID-19 prevention measures from Monday and two rounds of nucleic acid tests will be conducted on all medical personnel at three hospitals in Zhenhai.
The local authorities said public places in Zhenhai, such as scenic spots, performance venues, internet cafes and stadiums, had been closed and cultural, tourism and sports activities have been called off.
The Chinese mainland recorded 38 new locally transmitted COVID-19 cases on Sunday, the National Health Commission said in its daily report on Monday.
Twenty-eight were reported in the Inner Mongolia autonomous region, seven in Heilongjiang province, two in Yunnan province and one in Hebei province.
In Inner Mongolia, 27 confirmed cases and two asymptomatic carriers were found in Manzhouli, a border city under the jurisdiction of Hulunbuir.
""The city has provided services for those needing special care, including the elderly, young children, the disabled and hospital patients,"" said Guo Haitao, deputy director of Manzhouli's commerce bureau. ""Staff members will inquire and record the daily necessities and drugs urgently needed as they visit people's homes for daily testing.""
The local government has also coordinated with medical institutions in other cities－such as Beijing, Tianjin and Harbin, Heilongjiang's provincial capital－to provide online medical services to resolve difficulties in the medical treatment of residents who are under home quarantine.
The city started a ninth round of nucleic acid testing at 8 am on Monday.
As of Sunday, the region had reported 360 locally transmitted confirmed cases and two asymptomatic carriers since three residents in Manzhouli tested positive for the virus on Nov 27.
The seven local cases reported in Heilongjiang on Sunday were all detected in Harbin, the provincial health commission said on Monday.
All the cases were related to a confirmed case reported previously in Manzhouli, the city government said. In a statement released on Saturday, it urged residents not to leave downtown Harbin.
""Those who have to leave for special reasons should provide negative nucleic acid test results twice within 48 hours and follow good health practices,"" it said. ""Permission from a competent organization or the community, as well as the local epidemic prevention and control headquarters, are also required.""
All kindergartens, primary schools, middle schools and vocational schools will continue with online courses, the city's education bureau said on Sunday.
