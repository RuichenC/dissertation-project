2022-01-25,COVID-19: A Second Opinion,,"While social media operates on the attention logic, those with many followers have a higher potential to escalate issues. Celebrities started sharing information about the pandemic, but not all stars play the same role. Some educate and motivate the public about vaccination, while others spread disinformation content to their followers.
After the pandemic outbreak, some celebrities started sharing disinformation about the crisis. A may 2021 research study found that only 12 stars are behind the most hoax content producing about 65% of the content; the content included claims denying that Covid-19 exists or spreading false cures. Facebook responded by saying it took more content shared by these accounts, while Twitter permanently suspended two of the accounts. In some cases, some of these celebrities disinform the public by mixing their personal views and speculation with facts. For instance, Madonna, the well-known singer and actor with 15 million Instagram followers, claimed that the vaccine exists, but it was concealed to let fear control the people. Some malicious actors even decided to utilize the celebrities' power to spread false information about the Covid-19. In July 2021, a news report exposed a London-based marketing company that attempted to pay some of the influencers in exchange for sharing disinformation content. The company provided them with lists of dubious articles and sources that claim the Pfizer vaccine is dangerous.
But celebrities also have been playing a positive role. They involuntarily share correct information about the crisis by posting their photos of getting the vaccine to motivate their followers. In other cases, they are being hired by governments and companies. For instance, Biden's administration planned to use celebrities to combat vaccine hesitancy. In the UK, the NHS listed sensible celebrities to persuade the public to get their vaccine shot, and drug companies such as AstraZeneca also tapped into the power of celebrities to influence the public about the vaccine.
Celebrities will keep playing a significant role in this ongoing crisis. Tech companies should work more on monitoring the shared covid related content; media literacy groups should design materials that help the public not blindly follow the celebrities' content. Health information organizations should work directly with celebrities to supply them with updated information and fact about the pandemic.","DISINFORMATION & MISINFORMATION (93%); EPIDEMICS (92%); CELEBRITIES (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); HEALTH MISINFORMATION (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); VACCINES (90%); NEGATIVE NEWS (89%); ACTORS & ACTRESSES (78%); HEALTH CARE INFORMATION (78%); SOCIAL MEDIA (78%); SOCIAL MEDIA INFLUENCERS (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); RESEARCH REPORTS (71%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (60%)

2022-03-29,OP HILLMAN - COVID-19 REGULATION BREACHES UPDATE,,"COVID-19 isn't really over, I know. Every day, people get sick. This year, there will be 150,000 COVID deaths in the US. In the next 12 months, Israel will have just over 1,000 COVID deaths.
Despite the documented dangers, there comes a time when we just have to 'live with COVID.' Not just in words, but also in action.
The moment came when indoor mask mandates were relaxed for many people. I and my wife, Jody, held on longer. Five weeks ago, we received the Omicron booster vaccine, which we consider to be our turning point.
The feeling on that day was: We've done everything we can. According to Trevor Bedford, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center, this booster won't prevent us from getting COVID again (COVID likely continues to infect 50% of us every year), but it may lessen the severity of the disease.
Apart from that, I had a positive experience with Paxlovid when I caught be immunocompromised, but if I survived it once, I'll survive it again.
In crowded places, on public transportation, and on airplanes, we still mask up. As a result, things get awkward.
In The Atlantic, Kathryn Wu writes, mask wearers are a shrinking minority in society. Once again, the act has become strange.
As Joe Biden declared on 60 Minutes, 'The pandemic is over... If you notice, no one is wearing masks anymore.'
Wishful thinking does not constitute epidemiological accuracy. When he announced in 2020, 'One day - like a miracle - it will disappear,' Trump wasn't some Greek oracle. COVID-19 isn't going away by itself.
COVID-19 is still a huge problem.
One of Israel's biggest HMOs, Maccabi Healthcare Services, found that 34.6% of participants weren't back to their baseline health condition after recovering from COVID-19.
Even so, masking is down to 29% of the population in America, down from 50% to 80% in the first two years.
It's like showing up in a weird hat,' Wu's friend told her.
My mask prevented COVID-19. I couldn't resist. Doctors know best.
Meghan McCoy, an immunocompromised physician, says feeling alone is difficult. 'It is noticeable.'
A dysfunctional immune system doesn't always manifest itself as a big sign, McCoy says.
There are masks on those kinds of signs now.
Unlike wheelchairs, prosthetic devices, or service dogs, masks draw attention in a post-COVID-19 world. They 'invite skepticism, condescension and invasive questions,' Wu writes.
Wu explains that mask-freeing is like reverting to a safer, more peaceful past. People may feel jettisoned when they discard masks, while clinging to them reminds them of a difficult memory.
The 'new normal' is also an admission of failure.
An unstoppable virus now circulates among humans. Annual flu outbreaks still contain DNA remnants from the 1918 flu pandemic.
Mask-wearing and vaccines became political issues, not matters of public safety.
FAIL TO EMBRACE EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT OVER POPOPISM.
Jody and I attended the screening of Cinema Sabaya, Israel's top Ophir award-winning film. As soon as we heard the man behind us coughing, we donned our masks and felt safer.
Before big events or vacations, we wear our masks more consistently so that we don't miss out.
Wu asked her Taiwanese mother, 'How is masking working in Taipei? '
In public places, even where it is not mandated, it is quite common.
Her mother's response to Wu's question was telling.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (96%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); EPIDEMICS (92%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (89%); FACE MASK MANDATES (79%); VACCINES (79%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (78%); VIROLOGY (78%); CANCER (74%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (73%); MICROBIOLOGY (70%); SERVICE & SUPPORT ANIMALS (62%); PROSTHETICS & ORTHOTICS (50%)

2022-12-19,"COVID-19 Pandemic Over? Opinions, Please",,"The following is a lightly edited transcript of remarks made by Tanzina Vega during a Newsweek episode of The Debate about COVID-19. You can listen to the podcast here:
Outside of rugged American individualism, we need more empathy in this country. What broke my heart wasn't so much that people want to rip off their masks and go to party at nightclubs. I get that. It's human nature. But we had an opportunity as a country to structure public health through the lens of empathy. We can start to pull back on mask-wearing and some of the mandates as cases decline, but in certain instances we need to make sure that we're protecting the safety and health of those around us.
If you're double-vaxxed and boosted, your likelihood of getting sick or dying is very low, but we must consider the immunocompromised, long COVID, and the lack of healthcare and insurance in this country, because there are still people who are particularly vulnerable. I'm not saying stop the festivals or the partying. I'm saying there are certain instances and situations where I would hope that we could have a little more empathy towards each other, and the understanding that there are still people who are at risk. In public places, where people are going to be in tight quarters, let's do the right thing by each other.

2022-05-09,Show Empathy for Those Vulnerable to COVID-19 | Opinion,,"The city government reduced the operating time of its triage and testing facilities and is looking at closing the central isolation facility at the former Sto. Nino hospital.
The central triage and at the Baguio Convention Center will operate from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. from the previous 24 hours of operation and 8 a.m to 4 p.m. for antigen testing,"" city health officer Dr. Rowena Galpo said in a phone interview on Tuesday.
The move is part of the city's efforts to wind down coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) control and response systems amid the easing of pandemic curbs nationwide.
The city is also planning to close the community isolation facility at Sto. Nino Hospital as it only sees a maximum of 10 patients at a given time.
The patients will instead be housed at the central triage at the Baguio Convention Center compound under home isolation guidelines.
Galpo said most of the individuals who test positive for Covid-19 opt for home isolation, which means a low occupancy rate of the isolation facilities.
Only those whose homes are not favorable to the situation go to the facility, she said.
She said the city also scaled down testing protocols based on the guidelines of the Department of Health (DOH) limiting testing only to symptomatic health workers, senior citizens, and persons with comorbidity.
While the city continues to downgrade operations of Covid-19 facilities, Galpo said they will continue to promote vaccination as the primary preventive measure against the severe effect of the coronavirus on individuals.
Galpo also said the city's two-week Covid-19 growth rate decreased from 44 to 41 percent and its weekly infection rate dropped from 1.60 to 1.20 percent.
She said the city remains to have a high testing rate among residents averaging 108 to 102 tests per day. -PNA","COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); MEDICAL TRIAGE (91%); CITY GOVERNMENT (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); ISOLATION & QUARANTINE (90%); CITIES (78%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (77%); EPIDEMICS (77%); CORONAVIRUSES (76%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (76%); PUBLIC HEALTH (76%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (75%); VIRUSES (75%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (73%); VACCINES (73%); SENIOR CITIZENS (50%)

2022-11-24,Philippines : Baguio scales down Covid-19 facilities' ops,,"Coronavirus has forced us to live a life that most of us have never experienced before with almost one fourth of the world's population on lockdown.
A cloud of uncertainty has descended upon us all, leading to fear. The global economy has gone into a tailspin. No matter what part of the world we live in, no matter what our nationalities, color, religion, culture, socio-economic status, we are all facing the same crisis to varying degrees all at the same time. Our common fear can also become a source of courage, resilience and hope.
The current epidemic is forcing us to acknowledge that we are a world of common problems and solutions. Crises and disasters evoke a sentiment of kindness and giving that manifests in charity and philanthropy to those in despair. Of course, this is much needed, but it tends to only last as long as the crisis and disaster remain in the news. These are acts of sympathy - when you feel the suffering of others or, empathy- when you feel the suffering of others as your own.
Today I saw an ordinary couple and their children cooking. Then the man with his mask on left to distribute the food to the homeless twice in the day. Millions of healthcare givers are risking their lives round the clock. This gives me hope!
Sustainable solution lies in igniting and globalizing compassion. Compassion goes beyond just sympathy or empathy. It is a strong feeling for the suffering of others as your own, along with a deep desire to take action to end it.
This present crisis is an opportunity to reinvigorate our inner power of compassion and enlarge its circle to every known and unknown being. It is not just the virus that is infectious, compassion too can be contagious!
As we are asked to self-isolate and feel frustrated we must ask, what about those children who have no home to self-isolate in? While we panic about how we can fill our fridges, what about the families with no fridge at all? While we worry about our jobs, what about the people who only eat when they earn money that day?
Decisions made by our leaders, actions taken by us and the discourses that ensue in the next few weeks will be crucial. They are going to shape the future of polity, economy, culture and morality. Development priorities will be recalibrated, individual freedom, privacy and human rights will be redefined. Conventional politics can also be transformed into compassionate politics.
In the last two weeks, policy makers have already released over three trillion USD in emergency support for the companies and people in the richest countries. That funding is needed and is important, but we also need to see the governments of the world come together and announce a rescue package for the most marginalized children - even if 20% of this support was targeted at the poorest people and families in the world it would save millions and millions of lives. We are seeing debt assistance for some of the richest companies in the world, but what about the debt of the poorest countries who desperately need funds to fight this crisis! Cancelling the debt of the poorest countries would make all of humanity safer.
The truth is and always has been that we are all dependent on each other. The richest businessman is dependent on the poorest cleaner to keep him safe. Coronavirus is a stark reminder that the health of humanity is dependent on how well we can create healthcare systems for all our citizens. Our future, your children's future will be best if we can show compassion to all in these scary and uncertain times. Whether it is marginalized people in your community or around the world, reach out with compassion and take action today, tomorrow and every day.
If we can find compassion in our hearts, from the tragedy of the COVID 19 pandemic we can act to help all of humanity and develop a more just and safer future for all.
We humans are destined to live together. How we choose to live together, is up to us!

2022-11-22,Baguio scales down Covid-19 facilities' ops,,"By Jayasri Priyalal
Weapons of Mass Destructions (WMD) were something that USA and UK coalition forces were trying to find in the armouries of Saddam Hussain in Iraq in March 2003. Anglo-Saxon media was painting the fears of death, destruction and sufferings to humankind unless those weapons were destroyed – justifying the illegal invasion of the allied forces into a sovereign Iraq, violating all international laws and order.
They found neither any evidence of WMD nor chemical weapons for justifying the invasion. Will the COVID-19 too, become an invisible WMD with the ongoing global pandemic which has locked down nearly the entire world economy?
I would like to discuss the historical backgrounds of similar pandemic outbreaks and the geopolitical impacts that may unfold in response to various schools of thoughts and conspiracy theories. As the saying goes, worries are an abuse of imagination.
Misunderstanding, fake news, propaganda to stimulate election campaigns could overnight become breeding grounds for hostilities, unless we dispel the myths, ill-conceived perceptions pro-actively to avert unintended consequences.
Plagues and pandemics have brought miseries to all living beings, including humans throughout history. The earliest in recorded history is in Europe, suspected as black death like the Bubonic Plague, that hit Europe in the 14th century AD, wiping out half of the population across the continent.
Then comes the Spanish Flu (H1N1) in 1918 across the continents with many nations embroiled in World War I. The origins of the Bubonic Plague in 1341 is suspected of having originated from the trade routes on the Silk Road spreading through fleas hosting in rats. Still, the origin of the H1N1 Flu remains a mystery, although it is known as Spanish Flu.
Why was it then known as Spanish Flu? Again, a twist between real news and propaganda. Spain was not directly involved in the WWI as such, and the newspapers were freely reporting the facts describing the misery cautioning the public to take preventive measures to mitigate the infection.
Other nations, embroiled in war, have been battling the ""disease-carrying viruses"" through the soldiers and the refugees across the countries. Yet, they concealed the details to boost the morale of the fighting soldiers. So, the news agencies attributed the origins to Spain and the Flu to get the name as Spanish Flu. Between 20 to 50 million people lost their lives due to this pandemic, including 675,000 US soldiers. H1N1 Flu spread across every other part of the planet within a matter of months.
What is quite interesting to note, is that natural disaster emerged as a pandemic at the penultimate year of the WW1. Although no armed conflicts were running as great wars of the 21st century, there was a considerable trade war between the United States and China, just ended with some agreement in January 2020. As per historical records, reports that the then U.S. President Woodrow Wilson, who was a signatory to the Versailles Treaty, which ended the WW1, too contracted with the H1N1 Flu.
If one analyzes the historical facts and the significant causes and effects that have led to many wars in the past, one can always find a dominant ideology that has triggered such human catastrophes. These ideologies are possible to grow in the minds of human beings due to their superior ability derived and acquired since the cognitive revolution.
We can also draw useful conclusions about myths. These illusions led to human catastrophes resulting from different guiding ideologies with positive and negative experiences attributing to nature and all living beings.
In this context, we need to exert all our collective efforts to find out a scientific medical solution to wipe out the vectors spreading the COVID-19 pandemic urgently. False assertions of the origins of the virus as biological weapon finger-pointing and blame games are useless self-serving ego-boosting propaganda that needs to be dispelled and defeated.
The Treaty of Versailles, signed on June 28, 1919, ending the state of war between Germany and the Allied Powers, was a failed peace treaty that paved the way for another catastrophe for the whole world, the World War II. The Economic and Trade Agreement between the USA and China signed on January 15, 2020, should not meet the fate of the Treaty of Versailles.
It is a known fact that there is a Cold War underway between China and the United States, each contesting for priority, as China has proven to be a rising power. Moreover, the accusations and blame games and emotions between the leaders and the citizens of the two nations are running significant hurling accusations with each other, even before the ink is dried off the trade agreements.
The civilised right-thinking world and the universal multilateral agencies cannot alloweithercountry to ""Weponise"" the COVID-19 as a contest of will to emerge as a geopolitical and geoeconomic powerhouse.
Six billion people living outside the USA and China need to unite and defuse the unnecessary tensions building up in world politics. The whole world needs to deploy all resources and efforts at its disposal to overcome the common challenge, to fight out the unknown virus that has taken over two hundred thousand lives across all regions disregarding the geographical boundaries or the superpower status of the nations.
""If you want to live in this world peacefully and happily, allow others also to live peacefully and happily, so that you can make this world something worthy of life,"" wrote late Dr Kirinde Sri Dhammananda Thero, in his book,'You and Your Problems', which I thought to quote as my concluding phrase.

2020-05-12,Beware Of Weaponizing COVID-19 – OpEd,,"Counting the costs of COVID-19 far transcends head-count of fatalities. As a matter of fact, fatalities, if it will be rightly counted, should include, not only the numerical value of human lives lost; but also, losses in economic, industrial, vocational, educational aspects, among others.
The task of assessing wastes and losses brought about by the Coronavirus pandemic should at best enlist the dexterity of pundits in succinctly measuring the broken pieces and patches that can never again be mended or put together in terms of opportunity costs.
The lost grounds, in this respect, will include those heights that should have been reached, were the schools not closed down; those volumes of production and cycles of trade that could have been reached, were the productive segments not locked down; those trophies that were not lifted and medals not strewn, owing to suspension in sports festivals and tournaments; those feats and strides we lost in technology, industry, manufacturing and other tenets of invention, owing to the sudden cessation and truncation witnessed in virtually all activities that form the nerve-centre of our national life.
We ought to also consider, the helpless crippling witnessed in aspects of life regarded often as routine, sedentary of even, informal. In this regard, we list the line-up of progresses people would have made as individuals and groups or as corporate entities.
Ceremonies put on hold, weddings left unconsummated, funeral ceremonies left hanging in the balance and other social, religious, traditional functions put to a standstill because of their potentials for pulling mammoth crowds- all give the sad reality that we are not likely to emerge from this emergency properly right-sized in our mindsets to always cut our coats according to our sizes; or rather still, according to the sizes and dimensions of the available clothing materials.
Now that the chips are down, and the coast gets gradually clearer, we require to get acclimatized to better and more realistic attitudes. With the gradual reopening of our economy, we need to learn to do things anew. Remaining adamantly resolved to return to the old order implies that we hardly learnt any lessons from the pandemic experience.
The right attitude that should remain with us in the incoming post-COVID 19 era has as its central focus that we should never again be thrown off-guard.
Sanitation and personal hygiene should remain our cherished creed; while our daily ways of life should be such reordered to have wider tolerances for hand washing, physical distancing avoidance of overcrowded convergences.
On the whole, our touching behavior, body contact, crowd behavioural patterns, distancing and all of our clustering and settlement configuration need better adaptation at this period. Only in this doing would we have learnt proper lessons and internalized them, permanently, beyond the COVID-19 pandemic era.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); DEATH & DYING (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); TRENDS & EVENTS (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); CORONAVIRUSES (73%); VIRUSES (73%); VOCATIONAL & TECHNICAL TRAINING (72%); WEDDINGS & ENGAGEMENTS (65%); RELIGION (64%); Gambia (%); Coronavirus (%)

2022-01-20,"Sen. Johnson To Hold Panel Discussion, COVID-19: A Second Opinion",,"Here we are two-and-a -half years and many variants into the coronavirus pandemic, and the virus continues to surprise.
Take the recent news about the latest Omicron subvariant, labeled BA.5. According to Eric Topol, a cardiologist and professor of molecular medicine at Scripps Research, BA.5 is the most transmissible version the virus. It combines more efficient transmission and better immune evasion from previous infection and is driving a slow but steady rise of hospitalizations related to Covid-19 across the United States.
The million-dollar question now is not whether BA.5 (and its companion, the slightly less transmissible BA.4) will cause a major uptick in infection across the country -- it has, and it will -- but rather whether anyone, including those who have been vaccinated or have developed infection or both, is safe from its voracious reach.
The facts so far are anything but assuring. To explain the situation, I will use the ""just the numbers, ma'am"" subvariant classification that is dizzying for some and soporific for others. But here it goes: Omicron BA.4 and BA.5 are indeed slippery and seem to have evaded our current messenger RNA vaccine-induced immunity as well as the immunity provoked by infection due to all known variants (initial, Alpha, Delta) except perhaps Omicron and its spawn: BA.1, which caused the US December-January outbreak, and BA.2, including BA.2.12.1, which was responsible for the spring outbreak, particularly in the Northeast.
In a preliminary study from Qatar, which has not yet been peer-reviewed, previous Omicron infection was more than 75% effective in preventing new BA.4/BA.5 disease. A similarity between the BA.2.12.1 and the newer BA.4/BA.5 subvariant in spike protein structure as well as the ""fit"" of receptor sites may explain some of this apparent protection, according to a study in the journal Nature.
Given that the old vaccines and pre-Omicron variant infections are not protective against new infection (though still remarkably effective at preventing serious disease and death), what about the new vaccines that finally appear ready for prime time?
Much attention has been given to a vaccine made by the American biotech company Novavax, which just received emergency use authorization from the US Food and Drug Administration. On Tuesday, the vaccine advisers of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted 12-0 to recommend the use of the Novavax Covid-19 vaccine as a two-dose primary series in adults. Dr. Rochelle Walensky, director of the CDC, said that she has endorsed the recommendation. Novavax has said that its vaccine shows ""broad"" immune response to circulating variants, including Omicron subvariants BA.4 and BA. 5.
Hopefully, Novavax's assertion will translate into a meaningful difference in protection against new infection. The data available so far is from laboratory studies, not a clinical trial of patients at risk for the disease.
Ditto for the new generation of mRNA vaccines that contain new elements to induce antibodies against some Omicron strains -- the variant specific or ""adapted"" mRNA shots. (The current vaccines target the original SARS-CoV-2 variant that dominated in 2020.) It is uncertain whether these updated vaccines will be effective against BA.4 and BA.5 (or whatever comes next), though the preliminary results from Qatar provide some reason for optimism. After all, if previous omicron infection may elicit effective antibody against the newest variants, so too might a vaccine that induces similar antibodies to this ever-shifting variant.
The dream, of course, remains a vaccine that can produce a response that could handle any and all variants. It is not clear that such a vaccine is a realistic hope, at least in the short term. Finding a genetic sequence of the coronavirus that both is preserved across all variants and provokes potent antibodies is easy to think about but extremely difficult to develop.
The example of the still-unsuccessful, 35-year pursuit of a vaccine to prevent HIV infection is a reminder that scientific progress is always completely unpredictable.
Despite all these worries, I am not overly frightened about what's ahead. Yes, the BA.4/BA.5 wave will cause illness, upset plans and add to the daily annoyance of everyone. However, we are not in a free fall like we were in 2020.
In addition to the current lifesaving vaccines and the effective treatments for established infection, we have epidemiologic facts. With the original Omicron subvariants, BA.1 and BA.2, the intensity of the infection in the US came a month or more later than in South Africa and several weeks later than in Western Europe.
The latest dominant subvariant hasn't caused a substantial increase in hospitalizations or deaths in either South Africa or Western Europe. As with the previous Omicron subvariants, it seems likely that the US will follow those regions once again, with or without the new souped-up vaccines. If true, Americans have not yet seen the worst of BA.4 and BA.5. Hospitalizations and deaths in the US are rising and these subvariants will continue to increase their reach over the next few weeks.
It may be until mid-August before we experience the now-familiar sense of things quieting down. By then, the latest member of the Omicron clan, BA.2.75, dubbed unofficially the ""Centaurus,"" may be upon us. So, keep plenty of masks, plan your gatherings carefully and get a vaccine booster. Then prepare for a not-so-lively autumn.

2022-07-20,Opinion: Covid-19 continues to surprise us,,"Tobias Adrian is the financial counsellor and director of the International Monetary Fund's Monetary and Capital Markets Department. Fabio Natalucci is a deputy director of the department. This article was first published on IMFBlog .
Much the same way Covid-19 hits people with pre-existing health conditions more strongly, so is the pandemic-triggered economic crisis exposing and worsening financial vulnerabilities that have built up during a decade of extremely low rates and volatility.
Chapters 2-4 of the International Monetary Fund's recently released Global Financial Stability Report focus on three potential weak spots: risky segments in global credit markets, emerging markets, and banks. Should the ongoing economic contraction last longer or be deeper than currently expected, the resulting tightening of financial conditions may be amplified by these vulnerabilities, causing more instability or even a financial crisis.
 Risky corporate credit markets 
Risky segments of credit markets have expanded rapidly since the global financial crisis of 2007-2008. Potential fragilities include weaker credit quality on the part of borrowers, looser underwriting standards, liquidity risks at investment funds, and increased interconnectedness.
On the positive side, our analysis finds that investors' use of borrowed funds to finance their investments in risky corporate credit markets is less prevalent and that banks' are not as heavily exposed to leveraged loans and high-yield bonds as in the past. Both factors contributed to the global financial crisis a decade ago. The risk of investor runs have also lessened in some segments due to the prevalence of long-term, locked-in capital in the private debt and collateralized loan obligation markets.
In a severely adverse scenario, overall bank losses in risky corporate credit markets should be manageable, although they could be substantial at a few large banks. Losses at nonbank financial institutions, however, could be more significant. Given that nonbank lenders have taken a more prominent role in these markets, this could hurt credit provision and lead to a longer and more severe recession.
Policymakers should act decisively to contain fallout from Covid-19 and support the flow of credit to firms. In only a couple of months through late March, prices in risky credit markets dropped by about two-thirds of the declines experienced during the entire global financial crisis (although a portion of the losses have since reversed). At the same time, interconnectedness across risky credit markets has likely contributed to market turbulence. Broad-based demand for cash has triggered selling pressures, and mutual funds have experienced large outflows (even though they have declined or reversed more recently). Regulators should encourage asset managers to be prudent and use all available liquidity management tools to address such risks.
Once the crisis is over, a comprehensive assessment of the sources of market dislocations and unmasked underlying vulnerabilities should be conducted. For example, policymakers should consider including nonbank institutions in the scope of regulatory and supervisory oversight, given their expanded role in risky credit markets. In particular, a framework for macroprudential regulation of nonbank institutions, taking into consideration the global nature of these markets, should be developed, and the macroprudential toolkit should be expanded.
 Managing volatile portfolio flows 
Since the beginning of the pandemic, emerging markets saw capital outflows of over $100 billion, nearly twice as big (relative to GDP) as those experienced during the global financial crisis.
While outflows have since subsided, this dramatic swing underscores the challenges of managing volatile portfolio flows and the risks they may pose to financial stability.
The prolonged period of low interest rates encouraged both borrowers and creditors to take on more risk. The resulting surge of portfolio inflows into riskier asset markets contributed to buildup of debt and in some cases resulted in stretched valuations in emerging and frontier markets. As a result, they have become more reliant on foreign portfolio flows since the global financial crisis.
Our analysis suggests that both bond and equity flows are much more sensitive to global financial conditions during periods of extreme flows than in normal times, while domestic fundamentals (such as economic growth, financial market depth and external vulnerabilities) matter incrementally more for equities and local-currency-denominated bond flows. Furthermore, greater foreign investor participation in local currency bond markets that lack adequate depth can greatly increase the volatility of bond yields.
Emerging markets should manage external pressures by allowing their exchange rate to depreciate. If exchange rate movements become disorderly, authorities should consider intervening in foreign exchange markets. Temporary capital flow management measures may also have to be used in the face of substantial outflows. Sovereign debt managers should prepare for longer-term funding disruptions by putting contingency plans in place to deal with limited access to external financing.
 Banking: low rates, low profits? 
Profitability has been a persistent challenge for banks in several advanced economies since the global financial crisis. While very accommodative monetary policy was crucial to sustain economic growth during this period, providing support to bank profits, extremely low interest rates have also compressed banks' net interest margins - the difference between interest earned on assets and interest paid on liabilities. Our analysis shows that, beyond the immediate challenges associated with the Covid-19 outbreak, a persistent period of low interest rates is likely to put further pressure on bank profitability in the coming years.
Healthy banks play a key role in any dynamic economy, and are crucial for financial stability. When unable to generate profits, banks are less likely to provide loans and other financial services to households and firms, starving the economy of much-needed credit. A simulation exercise conducted for a group of nine advanced economies indicates that a large fraction of their banks, by assets, may fail to generate profits above their cost of equity in 2025.
The Covid-19 outbreak is an additional test of banks' resilience. Once immediate crisis-related challenges recede, banks could resort to fee income increases or cost-cutting to mitigate pressures on profits, but it may be challenging to fully allay such pressures. Meanwhile, taking excessive risks to recoup profits may sow the seeds of future problems. It is therefore crucial that policymakers rapidly find a balance that safeguards financial stability and financial institutions' soundness, while supporting economic activity. Various strategies to preserve and strengthen capital should be considered, including restricting dividend payouts and share buybacks.
In the coming years, authorities will need to take on some of the ""structural"" challenges banks face. For example, financial sector authorities should incorporate the potential impact of low interest rates in their decisions and risk assessments. Supervisory capital planning and stress testing should include ""lower-for-longer"" scenarios, and the strength of business models in such an environment should be evaluated. Supervisors should also remain vigilant and prevent any buildup of excessive risks that could reduce the banking sector's resilience.

2020-05-27,Opinion: Covid-19 Makes Financial Vulnerabilities Worse,,"Leaders of organisations have been advised to adopt the hybrid approach of working remotely within COVID-19 and beyond.
Director of Human Resource, Vodafone Ghana, Hannah Ashiokai Akrong, who gave theadvice during the 2020 virtual Accra SDGs Investment Fair, said globally, COVID-19 had influenced how organisations worked, and increasingly compelled companies to mobilise technology to aid work.
""The pandemic has impacted how we hire, altered how we work and compelled companies to mobilise technology to aid work. With about 90 per cent of the world going on lockdown in March, a good number of business entities had to figure out how to still be productive with staff or employees operating from home,"" she said.
""If you build the digital tools and infrastructure to work remotely, that's great but the physical work space is key for brainstorming sessions, collaborations and team bonding. A hybrid system is the way to go,"" she added.
She stressed the need for the business activities of the operators in the informal sector, which constitutes about 80 to 90 per cent of Ghana's economy, to be digitised.
""When COVID-19 pandemic hit, some businesses in the sector such as deliveries and food services went online and utilised social media platforms. There's no business which cannot harness the power of technology and innovation,"" Ms Akrong said.
The Director of Human Resource held that it was time modifications were made to education modules, where a lot of classroom learning was done online, adding that ""with little physical contact, continuous assessment should rather be done using more of online work"".
She suggested that reading materials should be given to students to read ahead of classes.
She entreated Ghanaian and African students to show interest in courses such as Software Engineering, Artificial Intelligence and Robotic Process Automation.
""There are many free online courses to take advantage of. Udemy, Inc. the American online course provider, aims at professional adults and students, and it has over 1,600 courses.
""Yale, Harvard, Coursera and the Microsoft partnership with LinkedIn all give free courses or paying ones for as little as $15,"" she said.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (90%); BUSINESS NEWS (90%); HUMAN RESOURCES (90%); HUMAN RESOURCES & PERSONNEL MANAGEMENT (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); TELECOMMUTING (90%); DISTANCE LEARNING (89%); COMPANY ACTIVITIES & MANAGEMENT (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); ROBOTICS (78%); ENGINEERING (71%); INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (71%); SOCIAL MEDIA (71%); TEAM BUILDING (68%); ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (62%); COMPUTER ENGINEERING (62%); Ghana (%); Coronavirus (%)

2020-03-18,SELANGOR POLICE LAUNCH OP COVID-19,,"By Helen Buyniski*
Mainstream media fact-checkers have rushed to the rescue after US President Donald Trump mused that injecting disinfectant might cure Covid-19. Except he said no such thing, and claiming he did is the laziest kind of ""fake news.""
Trump delivered a typically rambling riff on his medical advisers' latest revelations on Thursday night, waxing rhapsodic about the possibilities of using UV irradiation inside the bodies of coronavirus patients. ""Supposing you hit the body with a tremendous ultraviolet or very powerful light… supposing you brought the light inside the body, either through the skin or in some other way,"" he said.
""And then I see the disinfectant – where it knocks it out in a minute… and is there a way we can do something like that, by injection inside or almost a cleaning?""
While Trump was clearly talking about generally finding a way to 'clean' the body on the inside like disinfectant does on the outside, his media nemeses seized on the words ""disinfectant"" and ""injection,"" and concluded that the president was suggesting the coronavirus-stricken be shot up with the likes of Lysol or Dettol. #Resistance Twitter, in the grand Orange Man Bad soothsaying tradition, took it half a step further to assume he suggested injecting ""bleach or alcohol."" Some even grafted on references to the ancient ""Tide Pod Challenge"" meme.
Mainstream media pounced on the ""Trump says drink bleach"" narrative, distorting the game of telephone one step further with its usual patronizing 'fact-checks.' ""Mr Trump suggests injecting patients with disinfectants might help treat coronavirus,"" the BBC breathlessly claimed on Friday before reminding its readers that ""Not only does consuming or injecting disinfectant risk poisoning and death, it's not even likely to be effective."" Better write that down in case you forget!
They were far from the only ones. The Telegraph reported: ""Medics react with horror as Donald Trump claims injecting disinfectant could treat coronavirus."" New York magazine ran with ""Trump Suggests Injecting Disinfectant as Potential Coronavirus Treatment.""
Reckitt Benckiser, maker of Lysol brand disinfectant, even issued a statement warning against ""administering"" its products into the body ""through injection, ingestion, or any other route.""
The media might defend their alarmism by pointing to the man who died after eating chloroquine phosphate, a fish-tank cleaner chemically related to the malaria drug chloroquine, supposedly because the president had championed the latter as a treatment for coronavirus.
However, Trump never told Americans to rush out and consume the drug, and trying to lay the blame for that man's death at his feet is as absurd as translating ""maybe we should try using UV radiation inside patients"" to ""let's inject patients with bleach."" And if the media truly believe Trump supporters are so suggestible they'll consume anything the president expresses a preference for, they're actually putting those people in danger by claiming Trump likes the idea of injecting coronavirus patients with Lysol.
It's not clear how running with the worst possible interpretation of the president's words accomplishes anything but infantilizing him and his supporters, and allowing the media priest class that has tasked itself with interpreting his words to feel smug and superior. But then, that may be the point.

2020-04-24,Trump Didn't Suggest Injecting Disinfectant To Treat COVID-19 – OpEd,,"As the global Covid-19 health emergency continues, the economic fallout is mounting. Global economic growth has gone into reverse; businesses have started cancelling services to customers; and millions of workers are technically unemployed or fired. It raises the question: What happened to ""stakeholder capitalism,"" the enlightened economic model many companies embraced just months ago? How can it be squared with what we're seeing today?
To answer that question, let's recall what stakeholder capitalism is about: ensuring the long-term preservation and resilience of a company, and the embeddedness of a company in society. In this sense, a short-term economic crisis like the one induced by Covid-19 reveals which companies truly embody the stakeholder model and which ones only paid lip service to it while maintaining fundamentally a short-term profit orientation.
This applies to all organizations. The World Economic Forum, too, is faced with the question of what to do with teams that are temporarily ""technically unemployed"" with the cancellation of physical events. A shareholder-oriented organization would downsize immediately to maintain short-term profitability. But a stakeholder-oriented organization would try to maintain its core competencies, retain its talent and accept the short-term costs to preserve its long-term resilience.
We're fortunate enough to choose the latter route. For many years, as the founder and executive chairman of the World Economic Forum, neither I nor other member of the managing board asked for or received a short-term performance-based pay raise or bonus, despite a steady increase in the size and revenues of the organization. As a matter of fact, the World Economic Forum did away with bonuses entirely two years back. Employees should be motivated by purpose, not sales.
Because of that approach, our organization is not forced now to revert to immediate layoffs or to decrease offering to members. On the contrary, in the past weeks we built up a virtual offering, bringing together our global partners for meetings and best practice-sharing on Covid-19. We set up a taskforce to support the health response of the World Health Organization and to help ensure business continuity while protecting lives and livelihoods.
The same is true elsewhere. The Covid-19 crisis reveals who has been ""swimming naked"" while endorsing stakeholder capitalism. Of course, almost all global companies are profoundly shaken by Covid-19, and many have had to revert to very painful measures through no fault of their own. But the differences between companies that truly oriented their businesses toward the stakeholder model and those that had a short-term shareholder model can be striking.
Some companies used their rising profits in past years for major share buy-back programs. It boosted their short-term profitability and increased executive bonuses. But faced with the lack of strategic reserves or investments, many of these companies are now the first to suffer, unable to turn the situation around unless government intervenes. By contrast, companies that used profits to invest in digital transformation, talent and R&D often have an ability to react that other companies lack.
Similarly, some companies in recent weeks continued to announce record bonuses and rewards for their CEOs based on fiscal year 2019 profitability and share prices. Such short-sightedness won't be forgotten by clients and employees, many of which are suffering. By contrast, Marriot CEO Arne Sorenson, whose business and employees have been severely hit, said he and his chairman would take no salary in 2020 and the executive team's remuneration would be halved. It exemplified the company's embeddedness with its employees and societies in which it operates.
Finally, many companies that did embrace the stakeholder model already reacted by offering help during this crisis. Unilever, which has been a champion of the stakeholder model since Paul Polman's tenure, on Monday announced an immediate donation of $50 million in soap to the Covid Action Platform that was set up in response to the global health emergency. Shipping giant Maersk is offering its ships and cargo space to get emergency supplies wherever they are needed in the world.
These kinds of companies understand that a global health emergency such as Covid-19 requires all societal actors to temporarily reorient themselves to the emergency response needed, and they have the agility and preparedness to do so. That is not a coincidence. They are the same companies that optimized for long-term prosperity and cultivated shareholder capitalism. During these times, and when this is all over, we must support such companies. They represent the economic model that will make us survive today and thrive again tomorrow.

2020-03-28,Opinion: Covid-19 Is a Litmus Test for Stakeholder Capitalism,,"For decades globalization has been a cornerstone in shaping up a world order that is characterized by the interconnectivity of the world. At the time when the notion of Neoliberalism pulled through, the globalization paved its way towards eclipsing the protectionism. The end of the era of bipolarity is marked with the advance in globalization. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union, the world became much interconnected. As a result, investment and trade witnessed a boom, and barriers to trade, migration, and cultural diffusion dipped. Since the late 1970s, advances in technology and trade liberalization sliced up and witnessed growth across continents.
In the last few years, the globalization, however, on the accounts of some drivers, underwent setbacks. Accelerating trends in populism and protectionism have already undermined the drifts of globalization. The appearance of notable populist leaders, like Donald Trump, Jair Bolsonaro, Narendra Modi, and Boris Johnson have empowered deglobalized norms. Events such as the US trade war against China and Brexit run counter to the spirit of globalization. The global spread of lethal nationalism has also contributed to plunging globalization. Where such incidents were making every effort to undermine globalization, another forceful factor in the style of COVID-19 has emerged to hit globalization.
The novel strain of the COVID-19, in addition to its worrying effects on health, has the potential to strike globalization. It brings profound repercussions for individuals, communities, and counties. The outbreak of Coronavirus not only shoulders the responsibility for illness and deaths. Its omnipresence has also influenced the behaviors and beliefs of masses. The contagious action of COVID-19 has led the people to avoid physical connectivity, manifesting their unwillingness to engage with others. Social-distancing and isolation, being the preventive measures against the Coronavirus, have stirred the concerns about sociability and the connectivity of people.
Interconnectivity brings us multiple benefits and it is the lifeline for globalization. The COVID-19, however, has hit this (interconnectivity) sphere terribly. After the outbreak of Coronavirus, travel bans came into effect immediately. Travel banning actuated the limitation in the connectivity of people. The transnational mobilization of people has largely taken the edge off.According to the International Air Transport (IATA), in the wake of travel restrictions, the industry passenger revenues could plummet to $252 billion. Trade, business, and capital flows are principal actors in glorifying the globalization. The pandemic holds devastating implications for trade, corporations, and businesses. Global businesses have taken a higher hit as lockdown effects have reverberated over the last two months. Some countries restrained their exports to hoard supplies that disturbed chain supplies and exacerbated shortages. Moreover, the shutdown of factories domestically or internationally, to contain the contagious virus, has brought about shortages in automobile, textile, tech, agriculture, and pharmaceutical industries. Taking these determinants into account, global trade is all set to witness slumping trends. The World Trade Organization (WTO) economists believe that the decline will exceed the trade slump brought on by the global financial crisis of 2009. ""Never in the history of the IMF have we witnessed the world economy coming to stand still"", said Kristalina Georgieva, Managing Director of IMF. ""It is a way worse than the global financial crisis.""
The pre-pandemic wave of protectionism springs up as the COVID-19 has engulfed the nearly entire planet. Though the pandemic was recognized in China, the US has become its epicenter, with more than 2 million confirm Coronavirus cases to date. The worse state of the pandemic is likely to empower Trump's nationalistic posture. Trade war with China by imposing punitive tariffs on Chinese exports to the US, prioritizing domestic production, and offering incentives to companies to invest domestically, dominated Donald Trump's plan to undermine globalization. The pandemic, however, worked in favor of Trump and paves its way to stick to its anti-globalization mantra. Lately, Donald Trump demanded the 3M Company stop selling its masks to Latin America and Canada. The US ordered its federal pension fund to stop buying Chinese Share. Besides, Donald Trump also threatened the World Health Organization (WHO) to freeze the funding for it. Yet protectionism is not limited to the US, several countries appear to indulge in it.The Global Trade Alertteam in the Switzerland's University of St Gallen says 75 countries (include most EU countries, India, China, Brazil, and Russia) have introduced export restraints on medical supplies, equipment, or medicines. Japan's COVID-19 relief involves subsidies for those firms who repatriate factories. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi indicated that the age of economic self-reliance has commenced. The British government also expects protectionism to increase, supply chains to be brought back under national control, and nation-states to be strengthened.
The COVID-19 outburst has ruined the tourism industry too. Its losses are on par with the other spheres that are hard hit by the pandemic. The tourism industry accounts for 10 percent of the global GDP and 10 percent for global employment.According to the World Travel and Tourism Council(WTTC), the pandemic could cut 50 million jobs in the tourism and travel industry. The WTTC fears that in the event of pandemic's escalation, it could have a damaging impact on the tourism sector.
Given these facts, it is likely that globalization is all set to experience some significant impediments. As a result, global trade, the interconnectivity of people, tourism, and liberal norms are going to sink that doesn't bear glad tidings for the world. The pandemic, however, holds silver lining, if countries' leaders demonstrate their spirit to combat the pandemic, keeping intact those norms that underpin globalization. The danger of the second wave of COVID-19 infection looms large. If current trends predominate, the world may suffer a lot from what is expected.

2020-06-16,Sinking Globalization Amid COVID-19 – OpEd,,"NEW YORK CITY (dpa-AFX) - The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use or CHMP of the European Medicines Agency or EMA issued a positive opinion recommending the conditional marketing authorization of Pfizer Inc.'s (PFE) Paxlovid (nirmatrelvir [PF-07321332] tablets and ritonavir tablets) for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk for progressing to severe COVID-19.  If authorized, Paxlovid will be the first COVID-19 oral treatment recommended in the European Union. The European Commission decision on conditional marketing authorization is expected imminently.  The CHMP based its positive opinion on the scientific evidence supporting Paxlovid, including data from the Phase 2/3 EPIC-HR. The data showed that Paxlovid reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% (within three days of symptom onset) and 88% (within five days of symptom onset) compared to placebo, with no deaths observed in the treatment group, the company said in a statement.  Paxlovid is currently approved or authorized for emergency use in more than 10 countries across the globe.  Paxlovid is administered at a dose of 300 mg (two 150 mg tablets) of nirmatrelvir with one 100 mg tablet of ritonavir, given twice-daily for five days. One carton contains five blister packs of Paxlovid, as co-packaged nirmatrelvir tablets with ritonavir tablets, providing all required doses for a full five-day treatment course.

2022-01-27,Pfizer Obtains CHMP Positive Opinion For COVID-19 Oral Treatment,,"A number of religious leaders in Nepal have strongly criticized their government for scaling down festivals and centuries-old rituals because of coronavirus fears.
The leaders warned that ""divine anger"" could lead the country into catastrophe. Temples are closed and mass gatherings are prohibited following a lockdown since March. Officials say it is unlikely restrictions will be lifted ahead of the major festivals of Dashain and Tihar, which fall during the months of October and November respectively. Nepal, with its juxtaposition of Hindu and Buddhist religion, culture and lifestyle, has seen few holy day festivities during the pandemic.
In the capital Kathmandu, rituals including chariot processions that traditionally involve large crowds to honor various different Gods, were either cancelled or reduced to small ceremonies.
Meanwhile, in Israel one of Israel's most prominent ultra-Orthodox rabbis was confirmed on Friday to have tested positive for coronavirus. Rabbi Chaim Kanievsky, 92, is currently feeling well and is continuing his studies as usual, under close medical supervision,"" his office said.
Rabbi Kanievsky is a leader of the non-Hasidic ultra-Orthodox community, with hundreds of thousands of followers. The diagnosis came just two days after the Haaretz daily newspaper reported Kanievsky violated quarantine, hosting visitors at his home in Bnei Brak following Yom Kippur holy day despite being required to self-isolate due to his exposure to a confirmed coronavirus carrier.
Criticism of the ultra-Orthodox response to the pandemic has grown with widespread reports saying some are disregarding lockdown restrictions during the High Holiday season, including by continuing to host mass gatherings.
The crisis in the ultra-Orthodox communities is a major concern for health officials, who ascribe the high over-representation of ultra-Orthodox Jews among new infections in Israel to holiday gatherings, and crowding in ultra-orthodox educational institutions.
Israel's virus czar Ronni Gamzu said on Thursday that 40% of recent cases of Covid-19 contagion were in the ultra-Orthodox community, which makes up only 10% of the population, and highlighted a rise in the rate of infection among those aged 60 and over in their community.

 Do masks work? And if so, should you reach for an N95, a surgical mask, a cloth mask or a gaiter? 
 Over the past year and a half, researchers have produced a lot of laboratory, model-based and observational evidence on the effectiveness of masks. For many people it has understandably been hard to keep track of what works and what doesn't. 
 I'm[1]anassistant professor of environmental health sciences[2]. I, too, have wondered about the answers to these questions, and earlier this year I led a study that examined theresearch about which materials are best[3]. 
 Recently, I was part of the largest randomized controlled trial to date testing theeffectiveness of mask-wearing[4]. The study has yet to be peer reviewed but has beenwell received[5]by themedical community[6]. What we found provides gold-standard evidence that confirms previous research: Wearing masks, particularly surgical masks, prevents COVID-19. 
 Lab and observational studies 
  
People have beenusing masks to protect themselves from contracting diseases[7]since theManchurian outbreak of plague in 1910[8]. 
 During the coronavirus pandemic, the focus has been on masks as a way of preventing infected persons from contaminating the air around them - called source control. Recent laboratory evidence supports this idea. In April 2020, researchers showed that people infected with a coronavirus - but not SARS-CoV-2 - exhaledless coronavirus RNA into the air around them if they wore a mask[9]. A number of additionallaboratory studies[10]have also supported the efficacy of masks. 
 Out in the real world, many epidemiologists haveexamined the impact of masking and mask policies[11]to see ifmasks help slow the spread of COVID-19[12]. One observational study - meaning it was not a controlled study with people wearing or not wearing masks - published in late 2020 looked at demographics, testing, lockdowns and mask-wearing in 196 countries. The researchers found that after controlling for other factors, countries with cultural norms or policies that supported mask-wearing saw weekly per capita coronavirus mortality increase 16% during outbreaks, compared with a62% weekly increase in countries without mask-wearing norms[13]. 
 Large-scale randomized mask-wearing 
  
Laboratory, observational andmodeling[14]studies[15], haveconsistently supported the value of many types of masks[16]. But these approaches are not as strong as large-scale randomized controlled trials among the general public, which compare groups after the intervention has been implemented in some randomly selected groups and not implemented in comparison groups. One such study done in Denmark in early 2020 was inconclusive, but it wasrelatively small and relied on participants to self-report mask-wearing[17]. 
 From November 2020 to April 2021, my colleagues Jason Abaluck, Ahmed Mushfiq Mobarak, Stephen P. Luby, Ashley Styczynski and I - in close collaboration with partners in the Bangladeshi government and the research nonprofitInnovations for Poverty Action[18]- conducted a large-scale randomized controlled trial on masking in Bangladesh. Our goals were to learn the best ways to increase mask-wearing without a mandate, understand the effect of mask-wearing on COVID-19, and compare cloth masks and surgical masks. 
 The study involved 341,126 adults in 600 villages in rural Bangladesh. In 300 villages we did not promote masks, and people continued wearing masks, or not, as they had before. In 200 villages we promoted the use of surgical masks, and in 100 villages we promoted cloth masks, testinga number of different outreach strategies[19]in each group. 
 Over the course of eight weeks, our team distributed free masks to each adult in the mask groups at their homes, provided information about the risks of COVID-19 and the value of mask-wearing. We also worked with community and religious leaders to model and promote mask-wearing and hired staff to walk around the village and politely ask people who were not wearing a mask to put one on. Plainclothes staff recorded whether people wore masks properly over their mouth and nose, improperly or not at all. 
 Both five weeks and nine weeks after starting the study, we collected data from all adults on symptoms of COVID-19 during the study period. If a person reported any symptoms of COVID-19, we took and tested a blood sample for evidence of infection. 
 Mask-wearing reduced COVID-19 
  
The first question my colleagues and I needed to answer was whether our efforts led to increased mask-wearing. Mask usage more than tripled, from 13% in the group that wasn't given masks to 42% in the group that was. Interestingly, physical distancing also increased by 5% in the villages where we promoted masks. 
 In the 300 villages where we distributed any type of mask, we saw a 9% reduction in COVID-19 compared with villages where we did not promote masks. Because of the small number of villages where we promoted cloth masks, we were not able to tell whether cloth or surgical masks were better at reducing COVID-19. 
 We did have a large enough sample size to determine that in villages where we distributed surgical masks, COVID-19 fell by 12%. In those villages COVID-19 fell by 35% for people 60 years and older and 23% for people 50-60 years old. When looking at COVID-19-like symptoms we found that both surgical and cloth masks resulted in a 12% reduction. 
 The body of evidence supports masks 
  
Before this study there was a lack of gold-standard evidence on the effectiveness of masks to reduce COVID-19 in daily life. Our study provides strong real-world evidence that surgical masks reduce COVID-19, particularly for older adults who face higher rates of death and disability if they get infected. 
 Policymakers and public health officials now have evidence from laboratories, models, observations and real-world trials that support mask-wearing to reduce respiratory diseases, including COVID-19. Given that COVID-19 can so easily spread from person to person, if more people wear masks the benefits increase. 
 So next time you are wondering if you should wear a mask, the answer is yes. Cloth masks are likely better than nothing, but high-quality surgical masks or masks with even higher filtration efficiency and better fit - such as KF94s, KN95s and N95s - are the most effective at preventing COVID-19.

2021-09-30,"Evidence shows that, yes, masks prevent COVID-19 | Opinion",,"By Joseph Sunde*
As the COVID-19 crisis rolls on, many of America's governors have continued to impose, extend or add new restrictions to stay-at-home orders, leading to increasingly arbitrary rule-making and growing criticism over the prudence and practicality of such measures.
Thankfully, individuals and institutions rely on more than government diktats to guide their behavior. In turn, amid the government overreach and tense ideological debates, civil society appears to be self-governing rather well — marked by plenty of individual restraint, collective wisdom and creative cooperation. To be sure, we've had our share ofreckless spring-breakers,resistant religious leadersandcarefree employers. Yet the bigger story is one of personal responsibility and social innovation. Human cooperation is alive and well, even in a season of heightened coercion and distancing.
Aseconomist Lyman Stoneexplains onJonah Goldberg's latest podcast, people seem to respond more so toinformationabout the virus than edicts from government — proceeding to adjust their habits, behaviors and interactions accordingly. Surely, there are businesses who have closed their doors who would not have done so otherwise, but even amid those frustrations, enterprises and institutions quickly adapted, finding new ways to connect and collaborate while still preserving public safety.
""Many businesses closed down well before they were ordered to,""Goldberg writes, reflecting on Stone's analysis. ""Millions of people practiced social distancing and refused to get on planes not because they were commanded to, but because they were convinced this was a wise course of action for themselves and their loved ones. People change their behavior when they are given clear information about risks.""
While countries have tried a wide range of containment strategies, ""what we've seen in every country is that what really does it is information,"" Stone says. Indeed, prior to any government lockdowns, we can see asignificant voluntary shift in behaviorin the early weeks of the pandemic.
Yet the vibrancy of civil society isn't limited to its ability to ""social distance"" freely and prudently. With very little organized initiative or central planning, individuals and institutions also jumped into creative service mode — taking strides to create and operate in new and innovative ways, whether to keep businesses afloat, create in-demand products and services or directly combat the virus itself.
In anessay at Public Discourse, Antony Davies and James Harrigan reflect on this overall trend, noting that, ""as we are facing the highest levels of coercion in living memory, we are also seeing a degree of cooperation that is every bit as profound.""
Ironically, even the politicians seem to recognize this power and potential — in their own limited ways and when it serves their own limited purposes. For amid the various state-level cocktails of coercive measures, we have also seen a targeted loosening ofotherregulations, all in an attempt to incentivize support and assistance —cooperation!— among enterprises and institutions.
As Davies and Harrigan explain:
Vice President Mike Pence recently announced that medical professionals will no longer need separate licenses to practice medicine across state lines. This change has the potential to release medical professionals from areas in which the infection rate is lower to work where rates are higher. The underlying and extremely sane message is that, when it comes to caring for the sick, doctors are more expert than government regulators. We would be better off cutting through years of built-up red tape to let them ply their craft as they see fit.
Not to be outdone, the Department of Health and Human Services announced that it would waive licensing requirements, thereby permitting physicians to provide telemedicine services across state lines…The Food and Drug Administration has gotten in on the action too, announcing that it is relaxing regulations in order to allow companies producing COVID-19 test kits to bring them to market immediately. By contrast, the process of navigating a new product through FDA testing usually takes months. And it's not just medical regulations that are being relaxed. The Department of Transportation has suspended rules limiting the number of hours truckers can drive per day. With these restrictions lifted, truckers can get needed products to their destinations faster. This will come as welcome news to people looking at empty supermarket shelves.
It's an encouraging sign, and one that clearly affirms the reality that our capacity for cooperation moves well before and beyond what the government does or does not sees — allows or disallows. ""While this cooperation is most evident where government relaxes its involvement,"" write Davies and Harrigan, ""it is most meaningful where government was never involved in the first place.""
""The hallmark of civil society is cooperation, which is what we should all be thinking about at times like these,"" they continue. ""The coronavirus defines our collective life at present, but cooperation defines our collective life as a rule. Always. When our knee-jerk reaction to immediate problems is to coerce, as is so often the case, we push the obvious solutions to our problems into the background. And still, people cooperate.""
Indeed, in the spaces where barriers never existed, people were already busy realigning their habits and relationships, rethinking business processes, streamlining methods of exchange and adapting supply chains to meet a new set of human needs.
People were already busycooperatingto love and serve their neighbors:
People are offering free babysitting service, sometimes for healthcare professionals, sometimes just generally. People are volunteering to go to grocery stores for the elderly and infirm. People are packaging lunches for students whose only food came from their schools, most of which are now closed. In perhaps the finest PR move of all time, theGrub Burger Barin Atlanta even started offering the hottest commodity in the country, toilet paper, to their customers from their commercial stocks. The price? A shocking $3 for four rolls.
…Walmart hasn't closed its doors. The retail giant has instead cut back to essential products and reassigned workers from less important departments to things people need right now. Amazon has added a hundred thousand or so temporary employees to get much-needed food and supplies to customers all over the country. Just a few months ago, politicians were decrying Amazon and Walmart as exploitive companies and their founders' wealth as something that was undeserved and should be redistributed. Yet, in crisis, Amazon and Walmart have become the lifeblood for American households. They are, to say the least, good corporate citizens. Perhaps most surprisingly, professional sports team owners like Mark Cuban continue to pay their employees even as gate receipts have dropped to zero…
As if on cue, grocery stores around the country started reserving their first open hour of the day for the elderly and otherwise immunocompromised. Why the first hour? That's when the stores are cleanest, the shelves are fullest, and the lines are shortest. All of this is happening without a shred of governmental coercion. Left unchecked, this is what ""cold-hearted"" capitalism leads to, more often than not.
Here at Acton.org, we have highlighted a number of similar examples, frommedical-device innovationtocreative service among businessestosocial and economic action among churchesandcommunity institutions.
Through interaction and collaboration with others, we realize our needs and take care of ourselves, but we also meet the needs of others. Through work, we earn daily living, but more importantly,as we have seen, we realize our vocation to serve others and build civilization and culture. In the space between the producer and the consumer, worker and co-worker, the business and the customer, we see a diversity of roles, gifts, and innovations — embodying creativity, wise stewardship, measured risk-taking and creative service for the love of neighbor and the glory of God.
""These are by no means isolated incidents, and they shouldn't even really be surprising. When times become difficult, people come to help each other as a rule,"" write Davies and Harrigan. ""…Thankfully, for every governor declaring what people can or cannot do, there are thousands of regular people doing what regular people have always done: cooperating.""

2020-05-04,Cooperation Vs. Coercion Amid COVID-19 – OpEd,,"As of Saturday, March 28, 2020, nearly 650 thousand people worldwide are confirmed to have been infected by the Corona Virus (COVID-19). As I write around 4 p.m. EST (USA), more than thirty thousand deaths have been confirmed. The latest statistics show that the USA has superseded China as the epicenter of the virus with more than 116 thousand infected people.
In any biological system, if you put a living organism into an environment where it can thrive, with unlimited resources and no predators or competitors, it will always grow in the same fashion: exponentially.
In the case of the coronavirus COVID-19, exponential growth will occur in the disease rate in humans so long as:
1. there is at least one infected person in the population pool,
2. regular contact between infected and uninfected members of the population occurs,
3. and there are large numbers of uninfected potential hosts among the population.
Thus, it is believed that over the next couple of weeks the number will go up very sharply (see the graph to the right, where it is assumed doubling of the infected people every 1-5 days) in many countries unless preventive measures against the spread are taken.
Thus far, eight countries, the USA, Italy, China, Spain, Germany, Iran, France and the UK, account for more than 80% of the infected countries.
As expected, a vast majority of the reported deaths also came from these countries. E.g., Italy, Spain, China, Iran, France, the USA and the UK – accounts for 89% the reported deaths.
On the other hand, if statistics around the infected cases per million inhabitants are compared, the published data appear to show that people in the European countries were more vulnerable (more than 500 per million) by this pandemic than those living in the comparatively warmer territories (see the graphs and table).
It is worth noting here that the above statistical inference is based on the assumption of the supposed authenticity of the published data that are shared by individual countries, which may not necessarily reflect the ground reality in many illiberal democracies like India and countries that are ruled by authoritarian regimes. We would, thus, probably never know how many Uighurs and Rohingyas, encamped in Xi's and Suu Kyi's concentration camps, respectively, got infected and died.
Many governments were either in the denial of or too nonchalant about the effect of Covid-19 while they had missed the short window of taking preventive measures. In recent weeks, while it is heartening to see that government authorities have turned to proven public health measures, such as social distancing, to physically disrupt the contagion, such measures came rather late and have contributed to exponential growth of the virus-infected people all across the world.
In affected localities, all the academic insitutions are now providing on-line training. Unless required for emergency, most people are staying and working from home. These measures have severed the flow of goods and people, stalled economies, and is in the process of delivering a global recession. Truly, economic contagion is now spreading as fast as the COVID-19 itself. Millions of people have lost jobs in the last month. The Dow-Jones Index in the USA took a nose-dive, losing almost 40% of its value.
It's clear that a vaccine would reduce the need for social distancing and thus relax the policy's chokehold on the global economy. But no one within the scientific communities knows when that eureka moment will dawn.
In the U.S., politicians have passed a $2 trillion stimulus package to soften the blow of the coronavirus crisis. But such a package alone may not be sufficient even when the fear of the virus is gone without policy innovation that must include – amongst others – offering zero-interest loans to households and small businesses plus a moratorium on mortgage payments for residential and commercial borrowers.
No one in our lifetime has ever come across a crisis of this sort, triggered by an unknown and unseen enemy that could kill so many so fast. No one could forecast the devastating effect of this virus - sobering politicians, policy makers, and financial pundits. Perhaps the only certainty is that any attempt at a definitive forecast will fail.
Who knows this virus may teach humanity to sober up and make them God-fearing, thus, putting their collective efforts to better the lives of all, away from militarization and self-destruction!

2020-03-29,The Sobering Statistics Of COVID-19 – OpEd,,"The disruption of international transport and supply chains caused by the global Covid-19 pandemic could create volatility in China's agricultural commodities markets, especially among areas reliant on imports. These issues could be exacerbated by the reemergence of pests and diseases that could further constrict supply.
China is the world's biggest importer of soybeans, which are used to produce edible oil and agricultural feedstuff, buying from overseas 85 million tons of the total 100 million it consumed in 2018.
There are several factors at play in South America, a major source of soybeans, that could cause volatility in prices of the oilseed. This year the continent is forecast to reap a bumper harvest of 102.4 million tons, which could drive prices down. On the other hand, if countries there fail to control the spread of Covid-19, national lockdowns could be implemented. This would lead to soybean shipments grinding to a halt, and subsequently causing shortages in China later this year and driving prices up.
A similar situation could also play out in corn markets. China's corn production is expected to drop by 18 million tons in 2020, which could lead to higher prices. The potential reemergence of the fall armyworm, a pest that can devastate corn crops and is widespread in China, would also put upward pressure on prices.
But on the other hand, Brazil's growing corn production, which is set to top 100 million tons this year according to the country's agricultural statistics agency, could moderate any price increase.
China's pork market, which has been ravaged since late 2018 by a nationwide outbreak of deadly African swine fever, could recover this year and prices could begin to descend from record highs as the government releases meat from its stockpile and farms ramp up production under favorable policies. However a second wave of the outbreak remains a possibility, as there is as yet no vaccine or cure for the disease.

2020-03-30,Opinion: Covid-19 Will Worsen Instability in China's Agricultural Prices,,"We have rights but we also have duties.
During this difficult unprecedented global pandemic, a vaccine has been scientifically proven to be the paramount form of defense against COVID-19 and its variants. Although it is not perfect and there are unknowns, it is the best option available to fight the virus and recently received FDA approval.
According to the right of privacy, people have the choice as to whether they wish to receive medical treatment, including vaccinations, but individual rights must be balanced with societal rights. As a society, we have duties toward others. We hear the words, ""I have my rights"" all the time, but selfishly, many do not consider the rights of others who wish to remain healthy and not to die because of other people's rights to refuse to mask or vaccinate.

Society has people we do not know, and people we do. Parents have rights toward their children, which includes choosing among other things: how to educate them, bring them up according to a particular religion or not and determining their healthcare.
Parents also have duties toward their children, to look after them. For the most part, one does not have control over one's health, but COVID-19 now has a vaccine available that reduces the chance of serious illness. If a parent is sick, hospitalized or does not survive, who will look after the children? This should be a significant factor in determining whether parents with dependent children can refuse to vaccinate. The guiding principle of family law is the best interests of the child. Best interests are determined by the court according to what is best for the child, not the parents, who take a secondary place.
In times of war, rights have been abridged to protect society as a whole. COVID-19 as a global pandemic has abridged people's rights. Governments have instituted various measures to fight against the war of the modern day plague and to try and return their nations to health by using methods such as lockdowns and travel restrictions. Although an infringement of rights, these were deemed necessary for the national good. Likewise vaccinations should be taken since everybody has a duty toward ""their neighbor.""
The world is full of unknowns, but there are some knowns which we can guard against. It is the duty of parents, teachers and anyone else who has contact with vulnerable people to protect their best interests. There is also a moral duty to safeguard others in society. The scientific community throughout the world needs to collaborate to find the best solutions to improve the medical options available. We must work together to ensure the health of others. ""I"" have my rights, but all readers know that there is no letter ""I"" in the word ""team"" and surely this is challenge only a team effort will succeed.

2021-09-01,The rights we have during COVID-19 - opinion,,"As support to the efforts of the different local government units (LGUs) of the province of Agusan del Norte, the provincial government has released an augmentation fund of one million pesos each to the 10 municipalities and the lone city of the province.
According to Governor Dale B. Corvera, said fund will be used in the campaign versus coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), efforts to stop its spread and to augment the ongoing activities of the LGUs in their fight against the disease.
In the municipality of RTR, Mayor Richard Daquipil said the fund from the provincial government will be utilized to the Balik Probinsya program through the improvement of the evacuation center by converting it into a quarantine area/isolation area to accommodate Agusanons, especially those from RTR for the required quarantine period before going to their respective homes.
We cannot leave the barangays alone in the fight against COVID-19. So, after augmenting the anti-COVID funds of the municipalities and city, the provincial government also allotted a total of P8.35 million as support to each of the 167 barangays in their fight against the deadly virus,"" said Gov. Corvera.
Each of the 167 barangays will receive P50,000 as support to their measures to stop the spread of the deadly virus in their respective areas, Governor Corvera added.

2020-05-01,Philippines : Agusan Norte LGUs receive augmentation fund for COVID-19 ops,,"The COVID-19 as a pandemic has many security challenges for the under-developing countries, especially Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India. The economy of the mentioned countries has already been in a deteriorating situation since the pandemic began in 2019 last year, December. Economics is interlinking with the condition of crime in a society. It is all due to the economic situation in Afghanistan. The same case is for Pakistan too. Robbing people, Mobile snatching by forces have been common crimes in both Afghanistan and Pakistan, and during the COVID-19, it has sharply increased in rural areas of the countries.
Lack of opportunity for the general masses in the employment sector has also been one key factor in the rise of the criminal activists. In fact, most people have been living in poverty and have no other option except to target the bourgeois and fulfil their needs and demands.
Equal distribution of the resources at governments' disposal the current time of COVID-19 to the people could result in fewer crimes in those respected countries. 
As the COVID-19 situation becomes alarming, it has become challenging for the armed insurgents to continue their guerrilla and military operations in the conflict-ridden countries based on some reasons. The logistics have hugely impacted by the pandemic and could not be transported from one place to another place due to the fear of Coronavirus, and it's infection pace
Armed resistance groups could easily be conciliable to the policymakers in challenging times, and that could be an opportunity to convince them to put their arms.At the moment, the future of conflict is on proxy battlegrounds, governments which have been challenged by the proxies warfare should take advantage of the current pandemic and resolve the issue of armed resistance. A well-trained military unites especially 'special forces op' or 'Commando units' should be brought in to counter the proxy wars.
The pandemic has disrupted the operation of insurgents groups throughout the world. Governments with security apparatus should infiltrate the ranks of insurgents and focus more on the resistance groups in dismantling and disarming them through a process of negotiations and building confidence measurements.
Few reasons should be kept in mind to maintain peace and tranquillity in the society.
First and far most, the interior ministry should focus on reducing the crimes in rural areas and regularly patrol the crime-ridden societies. Apart from enforcing partial or full lockdown in cities, the police along with other security institutions should look after the criminals too
Secondly, the police departments in implementing the lockdown measurements should have carried out a plan for suppressing criminals activities in society. The police departments must be vigilant for protecting the properties of the people and should equally treat lockdown violators and open up eyes to catch criminals
Third, the interior ministry of each country is responsible for bringing tranquillity and peace into the cities. At the time of COVID-19 small crimes have been increased; the mechanism to decrease the number of felons the police department located in each district should report their daily achievement in reducing crimes to the interior ministry. Criminals should be warned in media through interior ministry
Fourth, the government needs to allocate the resource at their disposal to the poorest places in society. The most deprived areas are the hotbed of the criminals; they have no other choice except to commit crimes and fed themselves. Governments have the responsibility to provide rations to those areas where poor people have been living, and the COVID-19 has disrupted the daily wagers' work. Governments should find an alternative for daily wagers.
Finally, the concentration must be on averting the consequences that tie people to criminal or violent approach. In order to do it, governments need a systematic, combined, and accommodating tactic which combines the importance of a wide range of non-state actors and state. Furthermore, justice and policing have a significant role to play; suppression could be counter-productive if not mixed with developmental approaches that deeply look at the criminals and violence. In fact, to gear up things educating youth, socio-economic inequality could come the priority of the governments. Lastly, spending more time in school and colleges will reduce the youth to participate in criminal activities. 
COVID-19 has taught us many lessons. State and non-state actors need to apply all the measurements after the pandemic is over

2020-06-13,South Asia: Security In The Times Of COVID-19 – OpEd,,"One of the fertile areas for the spread of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) in the country is the marketplace.
Apart from the huge number of people who congregate in the markets across the country daily, which is already a worry, observing COVID-19 health and safety protocols in the markets is a major challenge to authorities.
It is in this light that the government has attached a lot of importance to the disinfection and fumigation of markets across the country, and yesterday, launched the second phase of the nationwide market disinfection exercise in Accra.
The first phase was completed in March this year.
The disinfection exercise is a collaborative effort between the Ministry of Local Government and Rural Development and Zoomlion Ghana Limited as well as Metropolitan, Municipal and District Assemblies (MMDAs), departments and agencies and aimed at markets, lorry parks and public places in all the regions, to curb the spread of the novel coronavirus disease in the country.
In March when the exercise was carried out, many praised the government for taking the bold step to shut the markets to fumigate and disinfect as part of efforts to curb the deadly pandemic which is wreaking havoc across the world.
Ironically, while efforts were ongoing to protect the people from the virus, many others disregarded what was going on and went about their business not only as usual but also refused to adhere to the COVID-19 health and safety protocols of washing hands under running water with soap, using alcohol-based sanitiser and practising social distance.
Is it surprising, therefore, that the disease continues to spread to the point that it has become necessary for a second phase of the exercise to be carried out to contain the disease.
The point here is that, it is everyone's responsibility to fight the disease and therefore, it behoves everybody to adhere strictly to the COVID-19 protocols.
Without that, the confirmed cases would keep surging and looking at the behaviour of the disease, it would be difficult to win the fight against it.
We therefore join the Greater Accra Regional Minister, Mr Ishmael Nii Ashittey to appeal to everyone especially the MMDAs, to take special interest in the second phase of the national disinfection exercise and whip up support for strict adherence to the safety measures.
The spread of COVID-19 in Ghana, is making everyone apprehensive and the only way to win against the disease, first and foremost, is to adhere to the health and safety protocols and to ensure a clean environment.
We also hold the belief that the market, where a lot of people congregate would be much safer if they are kept clean to prevent the outbreak of any sanitation related diseases.
Indeed, if we all consider the exercise as an effort to protect all of us, half the battle could be won.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); VIRUSES (91%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); SAFETY (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); SAFETY REGULATION & POLICY (89%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (78%); DISEASE REPORTING (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (78%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (76%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (76%); SAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (73%); Ghana (%); Coronavirus (%)",469,Eurasia Review
2020-07-20,Keeping Markets Safe Amid COVID-19 [opinion],,"The only good news about the COVID-19 social change impacts on our lifestyles is that the travel bans, and lockdowns have cleaned the globe, flushing the murk from Venice's canals, and we have seen cleaner air worldwide.
Seeking to cash in on America's response to the coronavirus crisis its wind and solar power outfits tried tosnare $billions out of the Trump administration's $2 trillioncoronavirus aid package. But to no avail. Congress is likely to continue to focus on injection of broad economic aid to workers and small businesses. The massive and endless subsidies for wind and solar electricity are likely to be put off until later legislation.
Far from being ""essential"", heavily subsidized, and chaotically intermittent wind and solar, and the fleeting jobs those industries create, are starting to look like wasteful luxuries that mega economies like that in Germany, Australia, and America can ill afford.
We have seen a serious reduction in the usage of the transportation infrastructures of airlines and cruise ships, as well as automobiles and trucks, and their impact on the leisure and entertainment industries, all to avoid crowds.
Along with those transportation options available for society, we have virtually eliminated the billions of vehicle trips to and from airports, hotels, ports, and amusement parks that have been increasing each year. COVID-19 has shown us that society changes can reduce the demand of those growing numbers.
Yes, we may have been using fossil fuels too extensively for leisure and entertainment, but the developed world is where it is today, healthier and wealthier, because of all those products we get from those oil derivatives.
Despite the preaching's about the renewable electricity saviors of wind and solar, it's becoming obvious that due to their intermittency and unreliability, and their inability to replace any of the derivatives from petroleum that account for the all the products in our daily lives, societies around the world may not be too thrilled about continuing the current social changes to live on just electricity from wind and solar. Remember the Great Horse Manure Crisis of 1894 in London, before fossil fuels?
Beyond the energy stability needed in hospital settings, the products produced from petroleum are what enables the heroic healthcare workforce. Products such as the critical medical equipment like ultrasound systems, ventilators, CT systems, and X-ray, personal protection equipment, medicines, masks, gloves, soap and hand sanitizers that we urgently need now would not be available without traditional fossil fuel energy and the derivatives from petroleum that provide thousands of products for our lifestyles.
The zero greenhouse gas emissions from industrial wind turbines and solar panels are ambitious goals for just electricity, but the economic and employment upheaval from shutting down traditional energy development is likely catastrophic financially. The climate solution proposals for wind and solar electricity are idealistic, unrealistic, and overly dependent on unproven technologies. This creates a fork in the road in terms of how we address our energy future.
Before COVID-19, the airlines that did not exist before 1900, transported more than four billion passengers in 2017 around the world and were projecting 7.8 billion airline passengers by 2036. Cruise ships which also did not exist before 1900 moved 25 million passengers around the world every year.
To meet lower emission targets, we'll need to continue to reduce the transportation demands of society and COVID-19 may be showing us how we'll need to retract from our extravagant usage of the various transportation systems that did not exist before fossil fuels.
Before fossil fuels and the thousands of products made from petroleum derivatives, and electricity that followed the discovery of oil, the world was a zero-sum snake pit that was a war against one another scrounging for food, water, and shelter. In the 1800's most people never traveled 100-200 miles from where they were born. Life expectancy throughout Europe hovered between 20 and30 yearsof age.
The social lifestyles before 1900 had no such transportation choices, as they had no autos, planes, or cruise ships for transportation. The inventions of the automobile, airplane, and the use of petroleum in the early 1900's led us into the Industrial Revolution. Crude oil, natural gas, and coal changed – for the better – the lifestyles of every person living in developed countries such as, the U.S., Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Australia.
The concept of electricity alone, from wind and solar industries has been exposed by COVID-19 as they are unable to support militaries, aviation, and merchant ships, and all the transportation infrastructure that support commerce around the world. Our future existence may be less vacations and less business conferences. Additionally, reductions in the usage of the entertainment and hospitality industries, neither of which existed before fossil fuels, may also be necessitated.
As we continue to emphasize the need for conservation and great efficiencies as the world weans itself from overuse of fossil fuels, we will need to lower our demands for transportation infrastructures. COVID-19 has shown us the way and has communicated why the wind and solar industries for just electricity have been crushed by COVID-19.

Attorney General Jason Miyares issued a legal opinion today that Virginia colleges cannot require their students to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as a general condition of students' enrollment or in-person attendance.
Miyares highlights the opinion that ""as recognized in the prior opinion, '[t]here is no question that the General Assembly could enact a statue requiring the COVID-19 vaccine for in-person school attendance.' As of this writing, it has not done so. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the General Assembly has amended other statues to address pandemic-related issues.""
Penny Nance, CEO and President of Concerned Women for America, gave the following statement responding to today's release:
""Attorney General Miyares' opinion proves that he respects the rule of law and listens to students, parents, and school employees. His first opinion as Virginia AG is a huge step in the right direction to personal freedom in education in the Commonwealth of Virginia. No student should be denied admission to an institution or admittance to class because of their vaccine status.
""Nothing in Virginia law empowers public universities to make such requirements and therefore we urge them to immediately rescind their policies.
We are grateful to Governor Youngkin and Attorney General Miyares and urge them to continue prioritizing education, parents, and students in Virginia and continue to push back on the authoritarian establishment.

2022-01-28,CONCERNED WOMEN APPLAUD VIRGINIA AG MIYARES FOR HIS PUBLIC UNIVERSITIES-COVID-19 VACCINES OPINION,,"It came from a student in health care training. I have diabetes increases the severity of COVID-19. I have a strong family history of diabetes. Kindly throw more light on the subject. In responding to this, I found a fine paper by Singh et al titled ""Diabetes in COVID-19: Prevalence, pathophysiology, prognosis and practicalConsiderations and published in Diabetes& Metabolic Syndrome: Clinical Research & Reviews (2020).
The disease burden of coronavirus infectious disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus-2 (SARS CoV-2) has been
Increasing continuously with more than five million confirmed patients and more than 350,000 deaths globally. With a high prevalence of diabetes, it is important to
understand the special aspects of COVID-19 infection in people with diabetes.
This becomes even more important, as most parts of the world introduced restrictions on mobility of patients in order to contain the pandemic even though they are being eased in some countries.
Diabetes and associated complications can increase the risk of morbidity and mortality during acute infections due to suppressed immune
functions. The levels of glycated haemoglobin (HbA1c) greater than 9% have been linked to a60% increased risk of hospitalization and pneumonia-related severity duringbacterial infection. Past viral pandemics have witnessed the association of diabetes to increased morbidity and mortality. Diabetes was considered as
independent risk factor for complications and death during 2002-2003 outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV-1). Similarly, the presence of diabetes tripled the risk of hospitalization and quadrupled the risk of intensive
care unit (ICU) admission during Influenza A (H1N1) infection outbreak in 2009.During the 2012 outbreak of Middle East Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus
(MERS-CoV), diabetes was prevalent in nearly 50% of population. Mortality rate in patients with MERSwho had diabetes was 35%.
Emerging data suggests that COVID-19 is common in patients with diabetes,hypertension, and cardiovascular disease (CVD). Evolving data also suggest that patients of COVID-19 with diabetes are more oftenassociated with severe or critical disease varying from 14-32% in different studies. SARS CoV-2, like SARS CoV utilises angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) as receptor for entry into cell.ACE2 is expressed not only in the type I and II alveolar epithelial cells in the lungsand upper respiratory tract, but also several other locations like heart, endothelium,renal tubular epithelium, intestinal epithelium, and pancreas.
S-glycoprotein on thesurface of SARS CoV2 binds to ACE-2 and causes conformational changes in the ACE-2 receptors are expressed in pancreatic islets. Infection with SARSCoV has been seen to cause hyperglycaemia in people without pre-existingdiabetes.
Hyperglycaemia was seen to persist for 3 years after recovery fromSARS indicating a transient damage to beta cells.
Metformin, a common medication used in diabetes, was significantly associated with a decreased risk of mortality in patients with chronic lower respiratory diseases. In a study of 4321 patients with a follow up of 2-
year period, metformin users had a significantly lower risk ofdeath compared with non-metformin users. Patients with coexistent chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and diabetes.
Glycaemic control is important in any patient who has COVID-19. Though data is still evolving, data from other infections like SARS and influenza H1N1
has shown that patients with poor glycaemic control have increased risk of complications and death. Most patients with mild infection and with normal oral intake can continue the usual antihyperglycaemic medications.
However, it is advisable to discontinue sodium glucose transporters (SGLT-2) inhibitors because of the risk ofdehydration and euglycaemic ketosis. Metformin may also need to be stopped ifthere is vomiting or poor oral intake. Doses of other antihyperglycemic drugs likesulfonylureas and insulin may have to be altered depending upon the blood glucoselevels.
Blood glucose monitoring poses a special challenge in COVID-19 as it necessitates frequentvisits to patient's bedside, especially if the patient is critically ill and receiving insulin.
There are several studies about the protective effect of statins in pneumonia. Statins are known to increase ACE-2 levels and may protect against viral entry of SARS CoV2. Also, statins are known to inhibit Nuclear factor kappa B (NFκB) activation and might help in blunting the cytokine storm- a causative factor in COVID-19 complications.
Calcium channel blockers (CCB) have been shown to reduce severity of disease and mortality in patients with pneumonia, presumably by inhibiting calcium influx
into the cell. It is therefore safe to continue these drugs for control of blood pressurein hypertensive patients. Since CCB has no effect on ACE2 expression, someresearchers have proposed its preferable use in patients with COVID-19 and hypertension.
So to recap high prevalence of diabetes is seen in patients with SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19)and the presence of diabetes is a determinant of severity and mortality. Diabetes might facilitate infection by COVID-19 due to increased viral entryinto cell and impaired immune response.Blood glucose control is important for all patients who have diabetes andCOVID-19 infection.Telemedicine can be very useful for the management of patients with diabetes inpresent times with limited access to healthcare facilities.
Once again, make sure you regularly/daily consume polyphenol-rich cocoa to among others reduce your blood glucose, reduce your blood pressure and strengthen your immune system.

2020-05-28,Diabetes and COVID-19 [opinion],,"Mr. President, the155 persons who violated the COVID-19 testing and isolation protocols, and evaded last month are a great concern to the public because it poses great health risk. This mistake of COVID-19 patients escaping quarantine should never be repeated again.
We have noticed that there is an increase in the number of deaths and an increase in positive cases these days, but yet, the majority of people don't wear masks, don't use hand sanitiser or respect social distance, which the health authorities and the police should be strict with.
Mr. President, we welcome the move by the government to increase allowances payable to doctors and PHD holders at the central level of the Ministry of Health to be comparable to their colleagues in the hospitals and other government agencies.
This will bring commitment and dedication on the side of the health personnel, which in turn will improve service delivery in the health sector.
Mr. President, your government needs to give attention to the Gambia Ports Authority (GPA), which is of concern recently. GPA should be given subsidy to improve the ferry services or invite foreign investors like Dubai Ports or Bolore to buy shares and develop the two identities because of the tough competition in the subregion that GPA is facing.
Problems like the lack of shore handling equipment, lack of space, including berths for ships resulting in delay in deliveries of urgent commodities is now prominent at the Port. These problems should be addressed soonest.
The Port should find ways of having its own dredger as it used to have a dredger called Malo in the past.
Government should consider selling shares of the Gambia Ferry Services and the dockyard which will help improve the services of these areas.
Mr. President, maintenance dragging is a basic requirement to any port to avoid impediment to shipping activities. Prevention is surely better than cure.
Government should look for the right experienced people in the maritime industry to be on the board of GPA and not friends, relatives or political friends.
Mr. President, all the board members of any institution should be appointed based on their experience in that field and should reside in the country.
Gambians outside the country, who are experts in their areas and are willing to come back and work for the development of the country should also be welcomed on board the bus.
Finally Mr. President, the government should consider revitalising our River Gambia by encouraging a river steamer service.
Government should also seek aid through their bilateral cooperation with Japan, China, Greece and Turkey to help with new ferries and ferry terminals at Banjul and Barra to be modernised with better standards since the OIC summit is next year.

2021-02-08,Good Morning Mr. President - Cause of Concern Over Covid-19 [opinion],,"I believe COVID-19 in spite of all that we are going through is historic! In my lifetime, this is the first time a disease has forced a lockdown of all systems in several countries including highly developed economies such as USA, UK, France, Germany, Italy and many more.
Several years down the line those who did not witness this will find it difficult to fathom life without travel, school, work, religious gatherings, marriages and funerals. I do not recall several countries having their borders shut for so long. There are currently about 3.6 million confirmed cases and about 255,000 confirmed deaths due to COVID-19 across more than 180 countries around the world. There are about 1,224, 000 recoveries from COVID-19 globally. The International Monetary Fund estimates a 3% contraction of the global economy in 2020 due to the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic- a situation much worse than the financial crisis of 2008-2009. In Ghana, there are currently 2,719 confirmed cases, 18 deaths and 294 recoveries.
There is an aspect of COVID-19 that I am using this piece to look at, and that is Stroke. The management is challenging on its own without COVID-19. I saw a piece by Rahma et al in the Journal of Neurology, Neurosurgery and Psychiatry, 2020.
Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID19), caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection, is associated with coagulopathy (increased blood clotting) causing venous and arterial thrombosis. Recent data from the pandemic epicentre in Wuhan, China, reported neurological complications in 36% of 214 patients with COVID-19 such as acute cerebrovascular disease (mainly ischaemic stroke) was more common among 88 patients with severe COVID-19 than those with non-severe disease (5.7% vs 0.8%). However, the mechanisms, phenotype and optimal management of ischaemic stroke associated with COVID-19 remain uncertain.
The paper (a post script) looked at six cases of stroke between 1st and 16th April 2020 at the National Hospital for Neurology and Neurosurgery, Queen Square, London, UK, with acute ischaemic stroke and COVID-19 (confirmed by reverse-transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR)). All six patients had large vessel occlusion. Three patients had multi-territory infarcts, two had concurrent venous thrombosis, and, in two, ischaemic strokes occurred despite therapeutic anticoagulation.
SARS-CoV-2infection is linked to a prothrombotic (increased risk of blood clotting) state causing venous and arterial thromboembolism. Severe COVID-19 is associated with proinflammatory cytokines which induce endothelial and mononuclear cell activation leading to coagulation activation and thrombin generation. The state can activate platelets and lead to thrombosis. Although ischaemic stroke has been recognised as a complication of COVID-19 (usually with severe disease), the mechanisms and phenotype are not yet understood. The group observed that acute ischaemic stroke accompanying COVID-19 infection has distinct characteristics, with implications for diagnosis and treatment. All patients had large-vessel occlusion. Two patients had concurrent venous thromboembolism.In five of six patients, ischaemic stroke occurred 8-24 days after COVID-19 symptom onset, and in one patient during the presymptomatic phase, suggesting that COVID-19 associated ischaemic stroke is usually delayed, but can occur both early and later in the course of the disease.
The findings suggest that ischaemic stroke linked to COVID-19 infection can occur in the context of a systemic highly prothrombotic state, supporting recommendations for immediate prophylactic anticoagulation with heparins, specifically low molecular weight heparins (LMWH). LMWH is administered once daily (mainly) and therefore reduces exposure of the health care provider. Early therapeutic anticoagulation with LMWH could also be beneficial to reduce thromboembolism in patients with COVID-19-associated ischaemic stroke but must be balanced against the risk of intracranial haemorrhage, including haemorrhagic transformation of the acute infarct.
New data from recently published randomised controlled trials (RCTs), in conjunction with unforeseen consequences of the evolving COVID-19 pandemic, now mandate an urgent review of antiplatelet (blood thinners) strategies in recently symptomatic patients. Prasad et al3 based on a meta-analysis of three RCTs (CHANCE, POINT & FASTER) in which 10,447 patients were randomised within 24 hours of experiencing a minor ischaemic stroke or 'high-risk' Transient Ischaemic Attack (TIA) to aspirin monotherapy or short-term aspirin + clopidogrel combination therapy, recommended in a British Medical Journal (BMJ) Rapid Guidelines document that there was now compelling evidence to support short-term treatment with dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in these patient subgroups. This fundamental change in recommendation, towards more routine prescription of short-term dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) in patients with TIA or minor stroke, assumes even greater relevance due to the consequences of the COVID-19 pandemic, which is currently wreaking havoc on health systems around the world.In presentations consistent with acute coronary syndrome (ACS) due to plaque rupture (i.e. Type I myocardial infarction), dual antiplatelet therapy (DAPT) and full dose anticoagulation per American College of Cardiology (ACC)/American Heart Association (AHA) and the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) guidelines should be administered unless there are contraindications. In patients with perceived elevated bleeding risk, regimens with less potent antiplatelet agents, such as with clopidogrel, should be considered given that hemorrhagic complications are not uncommon.
Special attention should be also given to drug-drug interactions between antiplatelet agents or
anticoagulants and COVID-19 investigational therapies. Parenteral antithrombotic agents, in
general, do not have known major interactions with the COVID-19 investigational therapies.
Health Providers have had to radically reconfigure the way hospitals work, including converting some operating theatres into Intensive Care facilities. This, inevitably, will have a 'knock on' effect on the ability to perform elective and even urgent surgical interventions, including carotid endarterectomy (CEA). The Vascular and Endovascular Research Network (VERN) has established a series of online surveys of vascular surgical practice around the world to gauge the effect of COVID-19.
I believe COVID-19 is still a moving target with daily updates on new dimensions of the infection. As related by one of the authors cited, even though the time period is too short to draw definitive conclusions, there is enough to show that COVID-19 patients are hypercoagulable (increased tendency for blood clotting) and at an increased risk for stroke. While we are at it, stay safe, keep to all the hygiene measures advised, daily and regularly consume polyphenol-rich cocoa. Polyphenols have blood thinning effects. This augmented by the high amount of theobromine in cocoa. Cocoa is the major natural source of theobromine.

2020-05-07,COVID-19 and Stroke [opinion],,"The first time I ever wrote about global health was an article on the looming AIDS crisis in my native South Africa. My piece for the Johannesburg Star in 1991 reported dire predictions from experts about the potential of an epidemic. A major cause for pessimism was that, back then, HIV/AIDS could not be prevented or treated medically.
The same was true of the outbreaks of SARS in 2002, MERS in 2012, Ebola in 2014, and Zika in 2016. It is also the case with the previously unknown coronavirus that causes Covid-19, which has now reached more than 100,000 cases worldwide.
Any disease which threatens lives is disturbing, but one for which there is no treatment is especially alarming. And, as we've already seen with Covid-19, countries and communities bear immense human, economic, and social costs. At the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, we're committed to doing everything we can to ease that burden, especially for the world's poorest people who are often hardest hit by epidemics and their aftermath.
That is why today, we are joining forces with the Wellcome Trust and MasterCard to beef up our response - backed by $125 million in both new funding and money already earmarked to tackle this epidemic. The money will be used to identify potential treatments for Covid-19, accelerate their development, and prepare to manufacture millions of doses for use worldwide. The expertise of pharmaceutical companies will be critical to this endeavor, named the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator.
Epidemics introduce a paradox to the world. Viruses like Covid-19 spread rapidly but developing vaccines and treatments to stop them moves slowly. If we want to make people, particularly the most vulnerable, safer from outbreaks then we need to find a way to unwind this paradox: to speed up R&D and slow down the spread.
The only way to treat a viral infection, such as Covid-19, is with antiviral drugs. Right now, we can only treat the symptoms since there simply aren't antiviral medications that can treat a range of conditions in the same way that antibiotics do for bacterial infections. This is where we believe we can help, by partnering with private and philanthropic enterprises to lower the financial risk and technical barriers for biotech and pharmaceutical companies developing antivirals for Covid-19.
We're optimistic about the progress that will be made with this new approach because we've seen what can come of similar cooperation and coordination in other parts of our work to combat epidemics.
The best way to prevent an infectious disease is with a vaccine. And in 2017, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) was created with nearly $650 million from Germany, Japan, Norway, Wellcome, and our foundation. Since then, others have come on board, including the UK, Canada, Ethiopia, Australia, Belgium, and the European Commission, to dramatically reduce the time it takes to develop vaccines for emerging epidemics, and ensure they are accessible, available, and affordable. The speed with which companies have begun working on a vaccine for Covid-19 is a result, in part, of CEPI.
Ultimately, our goal with the Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator is to do for treatment what CEPI does for vaccines. That requires governments, private enterprise, and philanthropic organizations to act urgently to fund innovation for drugs that can be developed, mass-produced and delivered rapidly.
As Bill Gates points out in his article for the New England Journal of Medicine, primary health care systems, which can monitor disease patterns and act as an early warning system, also need to be strengthened. And the world should invest in disease surveillance, including a case database that is instantly accessible to relevant organizations.
The Johannesburg Star was my very first job in journalism and I am proud of my article. I still have a copy of it. What I remember most is that it was headlined Aids spectre must be tackled - but for various reasons nothing happened for a long time. It would be unforgivable to make the same mistake with this epidemic. The need to act with urgency is critical. I'm fortunate to lead an organization that has the financial resources, technical experience and expertise, and the convening power to do just that.

2020-03-11,Opinion: Covid-19 Therapeutics Accelerator Can Help the World Find a Treatment,,"When COVID-19 happened in Wuhan in China and China concealed the information for some months and WHO also ""cooperated"" with China by not warning the world immediately about the impending disaster, no one thought that the COVID-19 crisis would shake the world  to the extent that it has done now.
When it was finally known that the COVID-19 virus was spreading fast all over the world, many experts opined that India could be one of the worst hit countries due to COVID-19, in view of its large population and high density of the population compared to other countries.
At present, the global COVID-19 tally stands at about 44.4 million cases and about 1.1 million deaths, with a percentage of death of around 2.5.
Europe has so far reported about 7.8 million total cases and about 0.25 million deaths. Europe as a region is now reporting more daily cases than India, Brazil and the USA combined.
Data for selected countries :
Country Area (in million Sq. Km) India 3.287 China 9.597 Brazil 8.54 Canada 9.985 USA 9.83 Russia 17.1
CountryDensity ofpopulation(persons per Sq. Kilometre)Number ofCOVID 19 Cases( in million) Number of deaths( in million )Percentage of deathIndia 382 7.8 0.12 1.51Brazil 25.06 5.3 0.16 2.95Canada 4 0.2 0. 01 4.70USA 35.71 8.7 0.22 2.62Russia 8.82 1.5 0.02 1.74
*  Figures for China are not considered due to lack of transparency in the country and only official figures are available and there is no way of counter checking it by an independent agency.
The above figures highlight the fact India has the highest density of population, considering its land area, which is less compared to some other countries such as China, Brazil, Canada, USA, Russia.
The success or otherwise of COVID-19 management should be seen not by the number of persons affected but by the number of deaths reported  amongst the affected persons.
Given the above figures, it can be clearly seen that the Government of India under the leadership of Prime Minister Narendra Modi has managed the COVID-19 crisis reasonably well, compared to several other developed countries,  as the number of deaths in India has been only around 1.5% of the total number of cases and the recovery is around 90%, which is much better than the world figures.
In a situation where the cause, effect and remedy for COVID-19 are still remaining as a matter of discussions and speculation and vaccine for COVID-19 is yet to be developed and proven and produced in mass scale and with such high density of population and around 25% of the people still living below poverty line, Modi government's performance in managing the COVID-19 crisis should be recognized  and considered as a vindication of the  reasonably efficient management of the COVID-19 crisis.
While the above figures are revealing, the striking aspect is that unlike other countries like the USA or Brazil or even some European countries, a very large section of people in India have not complained about any lacuna in managing the COVID-19 crisis and have reacted to situations  with understanding  and maturity. While some migrants complained about the lack of transport to go to their native place, the Modi government responded to their problem as fast as possible in the given circumstances. Most of the people have not accused  Modi  of  ""mismanaging"" the COVID-19 crisis. Of course, very few people have criticized Modi's leadership but such critics are not neutral people but belong to opposition parties and some sworn critics, who need to blame Modi for their own political survival.
Essence of Modi government's management of the crisis is that Modi has been continuously communicating with the people by addressing the nation at regular intervals and reassuring the citizens. He has been meaningfully coordinating with the Chief Ministers of state governments and taking them into confidence about the strategies and ground realities. He has not imposed his views on the state governments but has only given broad guidelines and left it to the state governments to manage the situation as they deem fit based on the prevailing conditions in each state.
When Modi asked the country men to applaud the doctors and para medical staff for their commitment in handling the COVID-19 crisis by clapping for a few minutes and when he asked the country men to switch off the lights and have candle lights for a few minutes on one announced day at a stipulated time in the evening as a mark of solidarity to fight against the COVID-19, the  country men responded with great enthusiasm, which is a very rare occasion of people responding to the call of the leadership spontaneously.
Further, when Modi wanted people to wear masks and observe social distancing, there was no protest from the people unlike other countries like the USA and a number of countries in Europe. It is quite true that some people did not observe the guidelines strictly but it was more due to indiscipline rather than due to protest against the guidelines issued by Prime Minister Modi.
In a free for all democracy in India (some people even call it as chaotic democracy),  where personal freedom is at near highest level and when people do not hesitate to conduct protest marches even for trivial reasons and when millions of people have lost jobs due to prolonged lockdown and people below poverty line were worst affected, it is extraordinary that Prime Minister Modi could manage this potentially explosive situation, without giving room for unrest and turmoil.
All said and done, for managing the COVID-19 crisis, the country has reposed great faith on Modi's administrative capability and personal commitment to the cause. This is one primary reason for Modi's success in dealing with the crisis situation.
Certainly, Modi has managed the COVID-19 crisis in the best possible manner under the given circumstances.
Modi's handling of the COVID-19 crisis is likely to become a case study for management students all over the world when the COVID-19 crisis ends one day.

2020-10-27,India 's Management Of COVID-19 Crisis – OpEd,,"On October 9, Gov. Gavin Newsom issued ""Guidance for Private Gatherings,"" which restricted the number of families attending the same non-public event, recommended a time limit of two hours, and demanded masks and social distancing. Any singing or chanting should be done in a low voice, wind instruments are banned, and the host is to take names of ""all attendees,"" should contract tracing be needed later. The next month, Gov. Newsom showed how serious he was taking the guidelines.
On November 6, Newsom attended a party at the upscaleFrench Laundry restaurantin Napa, which apparently had continued as an ""essential"" business during the pandemic. The gathering included a dozen people of different households, including top medical officials and lobbyist Jason Kinney. As photos of the event revealed, the guests weren't wearing masks or social distancing, and the group was so loud the sliding doors had to be closed. Newsom offered an apology, but if Californians considered it half-baked it would be hard to blame them. As they might note, this was hardly the only challenge of health guidelines by California's ruling class.
This month a group of legislatorsflew to Hawaii,a state more locked down than California, for an event of the Independent Voter Project at the upscale Fairmont Kea Lani on the island of Maui. The group included Democrats and Republicans, and some brought along their families. Unlike Gov. Newsom, this group defended the junket. Paso Robles Republican assemblyman Jordan Cunningham told reporters, ""This event promotes intelligent public policy in our state. In fact, we are here discussing ways we can safely reopen our society and save our small businesses, workers, and kids."" Like Gov. Newsom's crowd at the French Laundry, the legislators paid with their own money, but whatever intelligent public policy they promoted did not emerge in any detail. Both events bring to mind the late billionaire Leona Helmsley.
""We don't pay taxes,"" Helmsley used to say. ""Only the little people pay taxes."" In similar style, California's strict regulations apply primarily to the little people, not the ruling class. So on Thanksgiving Day, remember to keep on that mask, lower your voice when singing or chanting, and don't play any wind instruments. Be safe, and a white coat supremacy Christmas to all Californians.

2020-11-26,Gov. Newsom Launders COVID-19 Restrictions – OpEd,,"Femicide is the intentional killing of a woman because of her gender. Surprisingly, it is also the largest cause of premature death among women globally. Femicide, like COVID-19, occurs in every society indiscriminately, and spreads at an incalculable rate. While coronavirus is lethal and needs to be eradicated, so too does femicide. The difference between COVID-19 and femicide is that coronavirus is sudden and unpredictable, whereas femicide is repeated every year and is, unfortunately, predictable. While the World Health Organization has declared that COVID-19 is a global pandemic, it does not regard femicide as a pandemic.
According to statistics published by the United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) in 2017 – the last year data was collected on femicide globally – a total of 87,000 women were intentionally killed in that year. Nearly 60,000 women were killed by intimate partners, former partners or family members. 137 women across the world are killed by a member of their own family every day.
The connection between COVID-19 and femicide is more insidious than a mere comparison between two pandemics. The fact is that the coronavirus has had a negative impact upon domestic violence and femicide throughout the world, but no more global finances were allocated to eliminating the 'other' pandemic. During 2020, all countries reported a spike in domestic violence, at exactly the time that social and health services were being diverted to address the COVID-19 pandemic. This was exacerbated by lockdowns in most countries.

With families isolated in their homes, men felt frustrated and let it out on their wives and children. The closure of women's shelters for fear of the spread of the coronavirus also meant that some women and their children were thrown back to live with their assailants in frightening circumstances. With greater isolation, women were less in touch with social networks and support groups, and helplessness was increasing.
In 2020, the year of the lockdowns, Israel had 21 cases of femicide. In March 2020, the month in which the coronavirus pandemic erupted in Israel in full force, and when Israel imposed its first nationwide lockdown, five femicide victims were claimed. A year later in March 2021, when COVID-19 restrictions began to relax in Israel, there were no femicide cases. A sign at Jerusalem's Zion Square reading 'Sexual education saves lives,' on International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, Thursday, November 25, 2021. (credit: EVE YOUNG)
This year so far, 15 women have been murdered. All the victims knew their perpetrators; and all the perpetrators were of the same ethnic origin as the victims. Nearly half were Jewish, and nearly half were Israeli Arabs, with one femicide occurring within the Hebrew Israelite community based in Dimona. One third of the women were shot; over a quarter were strangled; and over a quarter were stabbed. The majority of femicides were perpetrated by partners or husbands. A few were also carried out dishonorably by other family members, as so-called 'honor killings.'
There has been a huge increase in violence in Israel among the Arab population. The toll is high: to date, 115 people have been murdered this year alone. Since most of the murders that take place are the result of gang warfare and underworld activity, and take place in the public sphere (including in and out of Israeli hospitals), the vast majority of the victims are males. The few women who have been killed in crossfire or by stray bullets, is small indeed. However, these are not considered femicides since the women were not murdered because of their gender, and have therefore not been included in the statistics collected by the Israel Observatory on Femicide (www.israelfemicide.org ).
The Israel Observatory on Femicide was established in November 2020, and is funded by private donations, but directed from the Hebrew University of Jerusalem in order to retain neutrality. The Israel Observatory aims at monitoring femicide in Israel, providing data to NGOs and governmental sources, and analyzing the narratives of femicide qualitatively in order to prevent femicide in the future. It is encouraging that overall the femicide rate has decreased this year. This can probably be attributed to the end of the severe lockdowns, the increased coverage the subject has received in the media and the wonderful work of volunteers in NGOs trying to combat the phenomenon.
 However, now we are faced with an alarming new problem. This year, one third of all femicide cases in Israel were matricides, namely, murders of mothers by their own sons. Matricide is familiar to us from the story of Cleopatra, the queen of ancient Egypt, who was murdered by her own son Ptolemy, but who could have imagined that such a thing could happen in Israel? In 2020, there was one matricide case. This year, there have been five cases: two in the Arab sector, and three in the Jewish population, including one ultra-orthodox (haredi) son, who stabbed his mother to death in front of his siblings.
On the International Day for the Elimination of Violence against Women, it is appropriate that we reflect upon what is happening in our own society. While it is a positive sign that femicide has declined this year, it should be noted that domestic violence can lead to murder. Femicide is albeit a different kind of pandemic from COVID-19, but cruel and lethal just the same.

2021-11-25,Violence against women spreading like COVID-19 - opinion,,"Internationally known US political prisoner Mumia Abu-Jamal has reported to friends and family on the outside that he has contracted Covid-19 in the Pennsylvania prison where he is incarcerated, and says he is having difficulty breathing. His life is in immediate danger and he is in urgent need of hospital care.
This latest outrage was sadly predictable. Prisons across the US have for years been allowing serious illness to serve as a form of ""silent execution"" of prisoners, many of them certainly innocent of the crimes they were convicted of. Many prisoners in the system, guilty or not, are serving unfairly punitive terms that keep them confined into an old age meaning they are particularly vulnerable to potentially fatal illnesses, whether that is flu, cancer, hepatitis, pneumonia or now Covid-19.
Noted journalist and political activist Abu-Jamal, now 66 years old and entering his 40th year in prison, is serving a sentence of life in prison without possibility of parole following his 1982 conviction of murder of a white police officer.
As I have written in my book on his case,Killing Time, his conviction followed a trial that featured coached and lying prosecution witnesses (including police officers), prosecutorial misconduct, withheld exculpatory evidence, racial bias in jury selection and a racist pro-prosecution judge overheard saying at the start of the trial that he would ""help fry the nigger."" His appeal process was just as badly corrupted. Significantly, it was fatally tainted by the refusal of a former Philadelphia DA, Ron Castille, who during his tenure oversaw the legal effort to defeat Mumia's appeals, to recuse himself later when, as a state supreme court justice he ruled on those same appeals he had overseen.
The entire legal process in Abu-Jamal's case has been an grotesque atrocity and an epic scandal.
Already suffering from cirrhosis of the liver because, like virtually all prisoners in American jails, Mumia was, until a federal court ordered it, denied timely access to medication known to be 95% effective in treating the Hepatitis C virus endemic in US prisons. This was done by prison officials who were well aware that the disease, if left untreated, usually leads predictably to cirrhosis, then to liver cancer and eventually to death. In Mumia's case, legal challenges by state attorneys for the prison system intentionally delayed that court order until he his disease had already advanced to cirrhosis of his liver.
Now Mumia has predictably caught Covid-19. I say predictably again because US prisons, overcrowded and impossible to maintain safe separation in, are known to be breeding grounds for epidemic disease, and yet have not been declared priority locations for early access to the vaccines that protect against the spread of this deadly virus that has already killed half a million Americans.
This denial of vaccination to a captive population of 2.3 million people is nothing short of a crime against humanity. It is a crime made all the more outrageous because, thanks to the excessive sentences so common in this vindictive, racist, classist and deliberately cruel society, many US prison inmates are old. TheBureau of Prisons reports that 20% of its prisoners, for example, are over 50. State prisons may be even worse, with many of them routinely sentencing felons to as much as 40 years, or, in case of rapes and murders, life without parole. Compare that to most civilized nations which limit sentences to 10-12 years even for the most serious of crimes.
Given the current pandemic medical crisis facing the US and the world, the US and all 50 states shouldimmediatelyorder the release of all older prisoners over the age of 50 unless a solid case can be made in individual instances that some older prisoner poses a grave risk of committing a violent act if released.
Mumia Abu-Jamal is not such a prisoner, having been a non-violent model prisoner for his entire 39 years of incarceration.
Free Mumia and all older inmates in Pennsylvania's prisons immediately!
There is a virtual rally for Mumia's release set for March 6

2021-03-02,Mumia Abu-Jamal Has Covid-19 – OpEd,,"We have all heard, from politicians and fromscientists, that the public-policy response to the COVID-19 pandemic should be based on science. For example,Joe Biden's website recommendswe ""Ensure that public health decisions are made by public health professionals and not politicians, and officials engaged in the response do not fear retribution or public disparagement for performing their jobs.""
While science can provide information to help politicians make policy decisions, science cannot determine the appropriate policy response to COVID-19, or any other public policy. Should schools open for in-person instruction? Should restaurants be allowed to operate at full capacity, or at all? Should the size of outdoor gatherings be limited? Should people be required to wear masks in public settings? Science cannot answer these questions.
This is not because scientific knowledge is limited (although it is) but because all of these policies involve trade-offs, and science does not provide an answer to how much people value one option over another.
The big trade-off that has been debated during the pandemic is protecting people from exposure to the virus versus allowing people to engage in economic activity. How much should we throttle the economy to reduce people's exposure? Science cannot answer this question.
Consider a less controversial policy: how high to set speed limits on roads. We know that higher speed limits will result in more fatalities from traffic accidents. That's science at work. But we are willing to increase the risk of traffic deaths to allow higher speeds. Science cannot determine the appropriate speed limit, although it can inform policy makers about the trade-offs involved.
The same is true of policies in response to COVID-19. Science can inform citizens and policymakers that if policy A is adopted, then B will be the likely result. Even if we are certain that those scientific statements are correct (and we are not certain, as scientists themselves admit), science does not tell us whether policy A is an appropriate policy.
Public health decisions should not be made by public health professionals, as Biden recommends. They can provide information, but weighing the pros and cons of policy proposals to make public policy is a political decision, not a scientific one.
When scientists recommend certain policies, or politicians say they are making science-based policies, they are claiming more for science than science can deliver.

 'As we start to pick up the pieces from the last 15 months, we have the opportunity to build back better. We refuse to go back to normal, because normal was broken. We cannot continue to warehouse people in overcrowded shelters or police people in the streets with no plan to move them into permanent housing.' 

Michael Appleton/Mayoral Photography Office Mayor Bill de Blasio at a press conference about homelessness earlier in his tenure. 

 There is an old adage that says, 'those who fail to learn from the past are doomed to repeat it.' If the COVID-19 pandemic showed us anything, it is that housing is healthcare, and housing and healthcare are racial justice issues. One look at the statistics and it is clear that these issues are inextricably linked to each other: People of color are disproportionately represented[1] among the homeless population. Black people are 57 percent of the homeless population in New York City, despite being only 23 percent of the overall population. 

The age-adjusted mortality rate[2] among single adults in New York City shelters was nearly 50 percent higher than that of the general population. According to Coalition for Homeless[3], by the end of February 2021, the age-adjusted mortality rate for homeless single adults was 153 percent higher than the rate for white New Yorkers. Studies show[4] that homeless people age at a rate faster than their housed, wealthier peers. This process, known as weathering, can age homeless individuals between 10-20 years beyond their chronological age. Additionally, homeless folks experience levels of chronic stress that affect morbidity and mortality rates, only exacerbated by the events of this year. These health disparities left people who are homeless extremely vulnerable to COVID-19's worst symptoms, including death. Healthcare providers, who intimately know the effects of this load on their aging patients who experience homelessness, have repeatedly asked if this is how society has chosen to treat our most vulnerable and elderly[5] population, as they witness patients presenting to their emergency rooms and admitted to inpatient wards. 

In the early months of the pandemic, we saw haunting pictures of men packed head to toe, sleeping on cold marble floors [6]in the lobby of homeless shelters because they had nowhere else to go while the city was telling everyone else to stay home and socially distance. This unconscionable treatment of homeless people continued for months as the city dragged its feet on moving people into empty hotels to keep them safe from COVID-19. Healthcare providers[7] witnessed this in real time and called for rapid safe housing as a public health measure early in the pandemic. And now, as if the mayor and his administration have learned nothing from the suffering and painful health disparities between wealthier white communities and communities of color, the mayor is telling people who are homeless that the move back to congregate shelter is imminent while offering no solutions to move people into permanent housing. 

 CityViews[8] are readers' opinions, not those of City Limits. Add your voice today![9] 

 There is another old adage that says, 'in every tragedy, there is opportunity.' The loss of human life from COVID-19 has been devastating, and the pandemic has laid bare the inequalities and injustices that are embedded in our society. As we start to pick up the pieces from the last 15 months, we have the opportunity to build back better. We refuse to go back to normal, because normal was broken. We cannot continue to warehouse people in overcrowded shelters or police people in the streets with no plan to move them into permanent housing. 

It is for this reason that we call on Mayor De Blasio and Speaker Corey Johnson to pass Intro 146 immediately. Intro 146[10] is a bill that would raise the City's only rental assistance voucher for single adults to Section 8 levels[11]. Currently, CityFHEPS pays as much as seven hundred dollars below fair market rent, essentially dooming CityFHEPS voucher recipients to permanent homelessness. Data from New York City's Department of Social Services shows that only 2% of CityFHEPS voucher recipients[12] are able to secure housing and move out of shelter using their voucher each month. That is an abysmally low rate of success, one that will never end or even put a dent in the crisis of homelessness our city has struggled with for years.  

With $6 billion of federal stimulus money in New York City, now is the time for Mayor De Blasio and Speaker Johnson to pass this bill. StreetEasy reports[13] that the number of vacant apartments in New York City at Section 8 levels increased by 142% in the second half of 2020 compared to 2019. If Intro 146 were passed, it would make approximately 89,000 additional units accessible for folks who are currently stuck in shelters. 

Intro 146 has been sitting in City Council for three years and has 39 co-sponsors. There is no reason to delay and continue to play politics with people's lives. If we are to learn anything from the mistakes of the past year, the city must invest in permanent affordable housing for low-income and homeless New Yorkers. We cannot and need not wait for another crisis; Mayor De Blasio and Speaker Johnson can save lives by passing Intro 146 immediately.

In a paper published this week in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, a McGill-led team published the results of a recent survey of 28 experts working in vaccinology. The survey was carried out in late June 2020. The majority of those surveyed were mostly Canadian or American academics with an average of 25 years of experience working in the field. ""Experts in our survey offered forecasts on vaccine development[1] that were generally less optimistic than the timeline of early 2021 offered by US public officials. 
In general they seem to believe that a publicly available vaccine next summer is the best-case scenario with the possibility that it may take until 2022,"" said Jonathan Kimmelman, a James McGill professor and the director of the Biomedical Ethics Unit at McGill University and the senior author on the paper. Many experts also believe that there may be some false starts before an effective vaccine is available. ""The experts we surveyed believe that there is a 1 in 3 chance that the vaccine will receive a safety warning label after approval, and a 4 in 10 chance that the first large field study will not report efficacy,"" added Patrick Kane, the lead author, who is a decision scientist and postdoctoral fellow at McGill University. Predicting timelines for vaccine development Experts were asked to make timeline forecasts for three milestones in vaccine development. More specifically, experts were asked for their best, soonest, and latest estimates for when each of the following milestone would occur: 1. Question: When will a vaccine be available to the general public[2] in the USA and/or Canada? Answers best guess = September/October 2021 (average) soonest = June 2021 (average)latest = July 2022 (average) 2. Question: When will a field study[3] with at least 5000 participants report results? Answers best guess = March 2021 (average)soonest = December 2020 (average)latest = July 2021 (average) 3. Question: When will a vaccine be available to those at highest risk from the virus in the USA and/or Canada? Answers best guess = March/April 2021 (average)soonest = February 2021 (average)latest = December 2021 (average) The researchers believe that this kind of approach, where people are asked to suggest a range of responses provides a more complete picture of the range of expert[4] belief than media quotes from individuals. Likelihood of setbacks The study also showed that about 1/3 of those surveyed believe that vaccine development is likely to face may face the following setbacks: 1. that the first vaccine widely deployed in the USA and/or Canada will receive a boxed warning from the FDA to highlight serious or life-threatening adverse reactions; or 2. that the first large field trial in the USA and/or Canada will report a null or negative result in terms of efficacy. ""Our study finds that experts are largely in agreement about the timeline for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine[5],"" says Stephen Broomell, an associate professor at the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, at Carnegie Mellon University. ""While this does not track with many overly optimistic government projections, it reflects a belief that researchers are indeed on a faster pace to development compared to previous vaccines.""

2020-10-01,Expert opinion: COVID-19 vaccine rollout unlikely before fall 2021,,"By Dr. Anne Zink
In early 2020, at the beginning of the pandemic, we knew almost nothing about COVID-19. How did it spread? Who would get sick? How could we protect ourselves and each other?
We saw hospitals being built and overflowing, first in China, then Italy and New York. Morgues filled across the world as health care facilities made desperate pleas for ventilators, personal protective equipment and additional health care workers. Here in Alaska, we scrambled to make our own testing supplies and to quickly build up our health care capacity. Public health worked to fill the gaps and supported the health care system by educating providers and the public, supporting health care staffing needs, and setting up testing, treatment and vaccination centers. Alaska's health care providers worked tirelessly to protect our communities, and I will be forever grateful for the dedication and resilience of our health care workforce.
Today, we have wonderful tools available to fight COVID-19, including safe and effective vaccines for everyone six months or older, giving nearly all of us the opportunity to train our immune systems to defend against the worst of a COVID infection. And for Alaskans with compromised immune systems who may not mount an adequate immune response from vaccination, we have Evusheld: a preventive monoclonal antibody therapy that protects people before they are exposed to COVID.
While prevention is always best, we also now have multiple COVID-19 treatment options — including antiviral pills — widely available at clinics, doctors' offices, and pharmacies in nearly every community in Alaska. The vast majority of Alaskans meet the broad qualifications for these treatments, which are highly effective at reducing the risk of hospitalization and death for people who get COVID-19. These treatments work regardless of whether a person is vaccinated, but they require a prescription and work best if they are taken very soon after symptoms first arise or a patient receives a positive COVID test. Family doctors, nurse practitioners, pharmacists, and others must be knowledgeable about the available treatment options, and people need to have timely access to testing and a health care provider.
Some treatment options may be going away altogether in the months ahead. Monoclonal antibodies were among the first outpatient treatment options available, and Alaska stood up the first state-run infusion center in the country. Monoclonals have been an invaluable tool. Clinics around the state rose to the challenge to deliver the medications to Alaskans, often free of charge and without an appointment. But as useful as monoclonals have been, they were never meant to be a long-term solution. For one, they're difficult to administer: they require injections or infusions at specialized clinics. They're also costly to produce, making them one of the most expensive drug classes out there. We have also seen rapid changes in the effectiveness of monoclonal antibodies as the virus has evolved, rendering all of our original monoclonals ineffective, unlike COVID antiviral medications, which continue to work well against newer variants.
Another issue is that states are reliant on the federal government for our monoclonal antibody supply. Alaska's supply of bebtelovimab, the only monoclonal antibody that remains effective against Omicron, is becoming depleted. We learned this week that the federal government will be supplying more bebtelovimab to states, but we do not anticipate the supply will last us much past August. The State of Alaska will continue to distribute all therapeutics we receive from the federal government.
For these reasons, clinicians and patients should not depend on monoclonal antibodies to be around for the treatment of COVID-19. Monoclonal antibodies have served us well, but they are less useful now compared to effective antiviral medications like Paxlovid and molnupiravir. There are several advantages to these new antiviral medications: first, these drugs can be taken orally as pills, making it much more convenient for patients. Second, they are also much less expensive to produce and easier to distribute to the farthest corners of our state. And third, they are effective against all current COVID variants.
Oral antivirals are abundant in supply, as is the antiviral remdesivir which is administered by infusion. But supply is just one part of the solution. Patients can't use these lifesaving drugs without a prescription. That means people need to get tested as soon as they suspect they have COVID, then should talk quickly with a health care provider about whether COVID medications are right for them. Providers need to be ready to help their patients by assessing their risk factors and writing prescriptions when needed.
It is imperative that my fellow Alaskan health care professionals learn about all of the available COVID treatment options and ensure that their patients are staying up to date on vaccinations. Currently we are seeing yet another increase in hospitalizations for those over 50 in Alaska, but we have the tools to prevent this.
In the months ahead, the burden of prescribing, dispensing and ultimately paying for COVID-19 treatments is shifting from public health into the health care sector. Public health will continue to stand in the gaps where we can, working to reduce the burden of COVID and other diseases and promote and protect the health and well-being of every Alaskan.
This pandemic has been long, hard, and at times confusing. We continue to share information at covidrx.alaska.gov, where you will find updates and resources for the public, as well as tools for clinicians to help decide which medication is right for your patient, and medication order forms. For any questions, you can call the Alaska COVID Helpline at 907-646-3322. Hours are 9 a.m.-6:30 p.m. on weekdays.
COVID-19 was the third-leading cause of death in Alaska in 2021. Because the worst effects of the disease are now preventable and treatable, we expect the threat of COVID to decrease over time. However, that expectation comes with a caveat: vaccination, early treatment and infection control practices can save lives, prevent hospitalizations, and reduce long-COVID, but only with professional diligence and personal effort.
It will continue to take all of us to make choices that protect our health, and to care for ourselves, our patients, our family and friends and our community. We also must continue to come together to make our systems of care work towards improving the health of every Alaskan.

2022-07-04,Opinion: COVID-19 is different in 2022. Here's how we move forward,,"London: Northern Ireland Executive Government has issued the following news release:
The Department for the Economy today published a statistical report and accompanying data tables presenting key findings on the Northern Ireland High Street Scheme from questions asked in the NISRA Coronavirus (COVID-19) Opinion Survey.
Findings from the NISRA Coronavirus (COVID-19) Opinion Survey
The statistics presented in this report cover two time periods; 2 August to 26 September 2021 prior to the launch of the Scheme on 27 September 2021, and 27 September to 27 November 2021 following the launch of the Scheme. The report provides a summary of responses to questions regarding the Scheme, and where the number of respondents is large enough, differences by age band, limiting longstanding illness, sex and employment status are discussed.
Key points:
During 2 August to 26 September 2021, prior to the launch of the Scheme:
    • The majority (97%) of respondents said they intend to apply for a prepaid £100 card when the High Street Scheme is launched, whilst only 3% said they did not.
    • Of those who said they intend to apply for a prepaid £100 card, nine tenths (90%) said they intend to apply online, whilst a tenth (10%) said by telephone.
    • Of those who said they intend to apply for a prepaid £100 card, the majority (87%) said 'I will apply myself ' , a tenth (10%) said 'I will ask someone to apply on my behalf '  whilst 4% said 'I will apply myself with assistance ' .
    • Of those who said they intend to apply for a prepaid £100 card, just over three fifths (61%) said they intend to spend all or most of the £100 in small local businesses. Under a third (29%) said they intend to spend some in small local businesses and some in large multinational companies, whilst a tenth (10%) said they intend to spend all or most of it in large multinational companies.
During 27 September to 27 November 2021, after the launch of the Scheme:
    • The majority (85%) of respondents said  ' I have already applied via the online portal ' , a seventh (14%) said  ' Not yet  –  however I intend to apply ' , whilst 1% said 'No  –  I do not intend to apply '  for a prepaid £100 card.
    • Of those who said they had already applied via the online portal, over four fifths (82%) said 'I applied myself ' , under a sixth (15%) said 'Someone applied on my behalf '  and 3% said 'I applied myself with assistance ' .
    • Of those who said they had already applied via the online portal themselves or with assistance, the majority (95%) said they found the application process very easy/ easy, whilst only 5% said they found it difficult/ very difficult.
    • Of those who said they had already applied via the online portal or they intend to apply, two thirds (67%) said they intend to spend or have spent all or most of the £100 in small local businesses. Over a fifth (22%) said they intend to spend or have spent some in small local businesses and some in large multinational companies, whilst just over a tenth (11%) said they intend to spend or have spent all or most of it in large multinational companies.
    • Of those who said they had already applied via the online portal or they intend to apply, over two fifths (44%) said they intend to spend or have spent all of the £100 on something(s) they would have bought anyway whilst over a fifth (22%) said they intend to spend or have spent none of the £100 on something(s) they would have bought anyway.

2022-04-14,Publication of Northern Ireland High Street Scheme Survey – Findings from the NISRA Coronavirus (COVID-19) Opinion Survey,,"Jan 26, 2022( Conservative Daily News: http://conservativedailynews.com Delivered by Newstex)  
 As recently reported[1], Senator Ron Johnson (R-Wisconsin) held a panel discussion on Monday in Washington, D.C. with medical and academic experts to discuss the response to COVID-19. The title of the panel was COVID-19: A Second Opinion[2] in which experts offered opinions that go against the grain of the mainstream narrative regarding 'vaccines,' what is known about the virus, treatment options and how to deal with it long term. Like a roundtable last October[3] in which Americans who have been injured by the jab or have had family members who were, Johnson invited the mainstream narrative pushers, like Anthony Fauci, and again they refused to show up. 'The human toll resulting from economic shutdowns is incalculable. 
The erosion of freedom and growing divisions within society, exacerbated by vaccine mandates, should concern us all,' Johnson opened the Monday panel discussion[4] which lasted nearly 5 hours. Johnson added: 'We invited folks from the federal health agencies and the CEOs and representatives of the vaccine manufacturers. They decided not to show up. That is somewhat telling, but also very disappointing.' As part of his opener, Johnson referenced what occurred on the Diamond Princess cruise ship which faced a coronavirus outbreak in March of 2020. The cruise had been out at sea as lockdowns were starting in nations around the world. On March 17, 2020, John P.A. Ioannidis wrote about the data from the cruise ship for Stat News[5]. Ioannidis, a professor of medicine and epidemiology at Stanford University, noted the evidence was clear that COVID-19 was not as deadly as the fearmongers were making it out to be and the authoritarian measures were unnecessary. Remember, that was only a few days after Donald Trump signed a declaration of a state of emergency on March 13. 'Back in March of 2020, when the coronavirus fearmongering from politicians and big money media was taking off, an outbreak of coronavirus and several deaths on the Diamond Princess cruise ship was among the examples used to stir up dread of coronavirus among the American populace,' wrote[6] Adam Dick. 'However, people who looked critically at the Diamond Princess situation realized that it suggested coronavirus did not pose an especially great threat.' Dick added: 'Ioannidis got it right. But that did not stop government from shutting down much of the American economy and violating freedom Americans had long assumed secure, all in the name of countering the hyped coronavirus threat.' Outside of alternative media sources, like The Defender[7] or The Daily Signal[8], covered Johnson's panel discussion. Instead of covering the event and hearing what was being said, some media used it as an opportunity to slander Johnson with headlines like this from the Milwaukee Journal Sentinel: Ron Johnson panel on COVID-19 to bring together vaccine skeptics and promoters of unproven early treatments[9]. Some of the experts discussed the efficacy, or lack thereof, from the shots while treatments are being ignored. 'I am really tired of watching the U.S. health system's failed response,' saind Dr. Pierre Kory, a pulmonary and critical care specialist. 'Things like not testing the vaccinated, things like not recommending vitamin D, not checking vitamin D levels, some of the things [that are] so fundamental and basic about medicine. I'mcalling attention to the corruption. These innumerable failed policies, they are literally written by the pharmaceutical companies. Every single policy serves the pharmaceutical companies. Outside the United States, look around the world, there have been numerous successes.' Dr. Robert Malone, inventor of mRNA technology used in the Pfizer and Moderna jabs, said: 'Even if every man, woman, and child were vaccinated, they cannot achieve herd immunity. Furthermore, they are not completely safe. The full nature of the risks remains uncharacterized. Usually, it takes us many years to fully understand the risk of vaccines. If there is risk, there must be choice.' Dr. Harvey Risch, an epidemiology professor at the Yale Schools of Public Health and Medicine, said the Food and Drug Administration 'mounted its biggest fraud of all time' in its effort to discredit treatments, like hydroxychloroquine. 'We heard at the beginning of the pandemic that one of the medications that has been used in early treatment, hydroxychloroquine, or HCQ, was a game-changer and would be effective in the treatment of COVID outpatients if started within the first few days of the illness, and then we heard study after study and media report after media report saying HCQ doesn't work,' Risch said. 'The negative claims continued for months until the media 'got bored with all this' and then acted as if the case were closed. However, this was a sham.'

2022-01-26,COVID-19: A Second Opinion Panel Ignored by Mainstream,,"In order to overcome the damages caused by Coronavirus pandemic, international collaboration has become important for the nations of the world. States take different methodologies, from national to global, to win the war against this invisible enemy.
Nuclear technology has scope to flourish in this intense phase of the crisis. Recently, the countries which want nuclear testing to identify and monitor the virus and its transmission paths, the International Atomic Agency (IAEA) has announced to deliver diagnosis kits and preparation. In addition, IAEA will offer nuclear detection facilities and support to countries requesting assistance to counter the worldwide dissemination of COVID-19. A new, radioactive diagnostic tool, named Real-Time Reverse Transcription Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR), is being stepped up in the nuclear-related sector. IAEA has offered training programmes for recipient countries where biosafety and biosecurity protocols will be established during processing and examination to safeguard human and veterinary staff and to avoid more external contamination.
Nuclear medicine is not surprisingly likely to play an essential role in combating the novel coronavirus. The nuclear industry has increasingly become a critical medical area, with a brilliant illustration of how nuclear power safely employs radioactive drugs or radiopharmaceutical compounds for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes. With a competent workforce in nuclear medicine in Pakistan, radioactive research has to be carried out against recent pandemic of COVID-19.
In this regards, Pakistan Society of Nuclear Medicine (PSNM) which was founded in 1995 and act as an umbrella body for Nuclear Medicine practitioners can be used as an effective platform. Moreover, eight Pakistan Atomic Energy Commission's (PAEC) cancer hospitals in Pakistan are already providing facilities in nuclear medicine to nearly one million patients annually and contributing to UN Sustainable Development Goals on ""good health and well-being."" PAEC is also sponsoring the research program in the field of radiochemistry and biochemistry. These research institutes such as Centre for Nuclear and Molecular Studies (CNMS) and Institute of Nuclear Medicine Oncology & Radiotherapy (INOR), can provide specific frameworks to carry out research.
Nuclear techniques such as RT-PCR are valuable instruments for easily identifying and characterizing viruses such as those responsible for COVID-19. This is also not the first time that nuclear technology has treated disease challenges. This recent pandemic also provides Pakistan with an opportunity to further strengthen its partnership with the IAEA. Pakistan has recently been emerged as one of the top beneficiaries of IAEA Technical Assistance in the Member States, due to its successful involvement in the IAEA Technical Cooperation Arrangements, comprehensive professional facilities and providing training to IAEA fellows at PAEC establishments. Pakistan has to collaborate with IAEA to obtain precursors and RT-nuclides along with the technologies needed to manufacture them. But in the end, Pakistan has few choices except to rely more on domesticradiopharmaceuticals.
Pakistan has taken significant steps to cope with COVID-19 as the diseasehas gained dangerous momentum in the region. The country director of the World Health Organization (WHO) Dr. Palitha Gunarathna Mahipala appreciatedPakistan's reaction to COVID-19 as ""World's best."" Pakistan has to utilize every mean to fight COVID-19 and this IAEA's assistance programme could be an effective tool. This assistance programme of IAEA supports the peaceful application of nuclear technology in areas such as human and animal health. It's funded through the IAEA'sPeaceful Uses Initiative, which was launched in 2010 to mobilize additional funding for such projects.
The added benefits of nuclear medical centres under PAEC supervision are international contacts with more developed countries through IAEA and bilateral relations with friendly countries. In the future, if the initiatives for the growth of this industry are intensively implemented, Pakistan may become a global expert in nuclear medicine. The technological, economic and human resources needed would without a doubt contribute to an increase in participation related to nuclear science in Pakistan where professional scientists already performing exceptionally. Pakistan will profit immensely from it, but the world community is the real beneficiary.

2020-04-06,How Nuclear Technology Can Help Against COVID-19 – OpEd,,"Many organizations in public as well as private sector keep on investing in Information Technology to progress their organizational profitability, operational quality and productivity, which helps them to combat competition. Telework reflects volatile and unconventional working environment. This prompt use of advanced technology has transmogrified the nature of services. Nowadays, organizations rely more on tech-led processes in order to gain a competitive edge and maintain extraordinary efficiency levels.
Many organizations offer their employees to work from home using Information and Communication Technology (ICT) and it is becoming one of the fastest and modern modes of working. Working from home is becoming popular method to run smooth working of organizations especially during disasters, crises and global pandemics and it also helps organizations in cost saving. Advanced information technologies are capable to connect people with their colleagues, supervisors as well as friends and family without physically visiting their places. Working from home has many benefits and opened new avenues of opportunities to employees but it has also posed some serious challenges for organizations as well as employees.
COVID-19 – a global pandemic initially originated in December, 2019 in Wuhan, China and has presented many challenges to health systems, organizational systems, psychological wellbeing and governance. It started spreading widely throughout the world in February, 2020 and ruptured routine life of everyone. It has pushed everyone into their own personal spaces in order to control its spread. Lockdown was observed in most of the countries, and there was no way for organizations to continue working except by allowing its employees to work from home using ICTs. This helped organizations and their employees to keep running their organizational operations smoothly. However, the increased use of ICTs has distorted the work-home boundaries and induced technostress among employees. The increased technostress levels and work-home conflict has created psychological pressure on employees and has also created challenges for organizations regarding their employees wellbeing and psychological health. 
In the recent times, employee wellbeing has gained some momentum as employers have realized that employee's wellbeing is an important factor in order to enhance organization's overall performance. Employee wellbeing is distinguished from general wellbeing because workplace settings are different from general life conditions. Technostress among employees is caused when most of their working is based on ICTs and they constantly try learning and coping with evolving technologies. As COVID-19's emergency situation has pushed the world to reconsider its management and working styles. In the world of digitalization, people have started learning and using more complex and advanced technologies and their leisure time is also spent in using social media and entertainment apps. The technology usage hours have increased drastically leading to serious psychological and mental health issues. Employees are also unable to distinguish between work and home time, as they have set working stations within their homes.
In conclusion, Information and Communication Technology during COVID-19 has transformed the working style of organizations and helped saving costs. However, it has significant impact on wellbeing of employees; therefore, there is a dire need for organizational managers and researchers to find ways to cope with work-related anxiety. Training modules should be introduced in order to increase personal resources such as mindfulness and technology readiness to help employees cope with the rapidly changing environment and to have a self-control. This would lead them to work with more focus and to distinguish between work and home life after buffering the impact of technostress.

2020-08-02,DATA COMMUNICATIONS: COVID-19 DOMESTIC TRAVEL PUBLIC OPINION POLL RESULTS,,"Canberra: Department of Defence Australia has issued the following news release:
With efforts to contain the COVID-19 pandemic requiring more ADF support, the 7th Combat Brigade is again sending troops to the Queensland/NSW border to assist protecting the community and support local police at checkpoints.
The brigade element of 35 members includes a company headquarter team, which will lead the ADF border task element.
Commander of the 7th Combat Brigade Brigadier Jason Blain farewelled the element, deploying alongside members of the RAAF and RAN, who had also been called in at short notice.
Brigadier Blain said the 7th Combat Brigade regularly answered the call of the Australian people when in need, having deployed more than 2800 members in support of bushfires, floods, natural disasters and the pandemic in the past 18 months.
“ Since January of 2020 - bushfires, floods, support to Fiji after the cyclone - there ' s been about 2800 of this brigade deployed to support domestic or rapid offshore operations, including more than 2000 members on Operation COVID-19 Assist, ” Brigadier Blain said.
Right now we have members of the brigade serving in Tasmania, Victoria and throughout southern Queensland on COVID tasks.
“ We had members of the brigade on the border checkpoints for a long time last year, and now we ' re sending them back.
“ We are again and again answering the call to conduct operations for our communities in crisis as we ' re seeing the Australian Defence Force called upon once more to support the nation.
“ This is a noble job for us to do, and it ' s a role we must do. We are here to protect the nation and that ' s not just about how we conduct warfighting, or defeat our enemies, but also how we protect our community. ”
Brigadier Blain said domestic tasks in support of Australians were an important role for the ADF to support, highlighting the professionalism of the men and women who serve.
“ Every time an Australian soldier, aviator or sailor is seen on the ground at a hotel, airport, or at a state border, the community knows they are there for their safety and that they are in good hands, ” he said.
“ When our soldiers do their job, they do it well, they do it professionally, and they work hand in glove with other agencies to get the job done.
“ To see 7th Combat Brigade stepping up again to do this job fills me with pride. They step up to the challenge again and again. ”","COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); ARMED FORCES (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); NEGATIVE NEWS (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS (89%); BORDER CONTROL (78%); SAFETY (78%); TERRITORIAL & NATIONAL BORDERS (78%); SAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (77%); WAR & CONFLICT (77%); BUSINESS OPERATIONS (76%); WILDFIRES (74%); POLICE FORCES (72%); ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (69%); NATURAL DISASTERS (69%)

2021-08-27,Back to the border on Op COVID-19 assist,,"A simple and inexpensive device saved my daughter's life.
Last March, my daughter, a 43-year-old healthy mother of five, was the last person in her family to be infected with COVID-19. The others recovered quickly, but she clearly had a bad case of the disease. I asked my brother, a retired doctor who lives in the US, what steps we could take, to know if and when the virus actually attacked her lungs. 
My brother suggested we use an inexpensive home oximeter, which looks like a large plastic clothespin and is attached to one's middle finger, to monitor my daughter's blood oxygen level. My brother's suggestion was inspired by an April 2020 article written in The New York Times by Dr. Richard Levitan, a seasoned emergency medicine doctor, based on his experience with COVID-19 patients in New York City. 

In the case of normal pneumonia, when a person's lungs become infected, a lack of oxygen (""hypoxia"") can ensue, leading the person to feel shortness of breath, and prompting her to take action to receive help. But Dr. Levitan noted that many patients with COVID-19 pneumonia lack oxygen without feeling shortness of breath, so they do not ask for help until hypoxia is severe, and arrive at the hospital ""too late,"" with badly damaged lungs. He called this condition, seemingly unique to COVID-19 patients, ""silent hypoxia."" Dr. Levitan suggested that COVID-19 patients identify this condition early by using home oximeters, in order to arrive at the hospital quickly to receive early treatment.
I bought an oximeter, gave it to my daughter, and asked her to call me if her blood oxygen level fell below the accepted value. Initially her blood oxygen level was normal, but after four days of fever, just when she seemed to be recovering, she called me at 11 p.m. one night and told me her blood oxygen level was much lower than normal. In fact, her blood oxygen level was so low it indicated a clinical emergency. ""But I feel perfectly fine,"" she told me.
At that moment, I knew she was suffering from silent hypoxia. Along with urgent messages from my brother and her own doctor, I was finally able to convince my reluctant daughter to hurry to the hospital's emergency room. Her oxygen level was measured there and indeed found to be dangerously low. She was immediately given supplemental oxygen and steroids, and spent three days in critical care. Eventually she recovered. I shudder to think what might have happened if, the night she called me, she did not have a home oximeter or did not know how to use it. Children wearing face masks attend a class as students return to school after the summer break, less than a month into a coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccine booster drive, at Arazim Elementary School in Tel Aviv, Israel September 1, 2021 (credit: REUTERS/AMIR COHEN)

ISRAEL AND other countries throughout the world are currently fighting a new wave of the pandemic, as a result of the Delta version of the virus. The numbers of infected patients, and therefore patients in severe condition, are increasing. What can be done to limit these numbers? Research studies around the world have supported the recommendation that self-monitoring with home oximeters can save many lives.
 The results of this simple intervention are impressive. One of the best examples is the COVID Oximetry @home program (CO@h ) program of the UK's National Health Service. In June of this year, a comprehensive ""evaluation of patient outcomes"" study determined that this program, compared with a control group, demonstrated ""considerably improved patient outcomes, reducing the odds of longer length hospital stays and mortality."" Other venues that have adopted similar policies include Germany, New York City, Vermont and the Mayo Clinic.
Self-monitoring of oxygen levels at home is effective because when COVID-19 patients (in coordination with their doctors) detect low blood oxygen levels – a sure sign of lung damage by the virus – relatively early, they can arrive at the hospital for prompt and timely treatment, before their illness becomes life-threatening.
For this reason, some health maintenance organizations (kupot holim) provide home oximeters to their COVID-19 patients. When this is not the case, patients should be encouraged to purchase these devices at their local pharmacies. If every household has a thermometer, shouldn't every COVID-19 patient have access to a potentially life-saving oximeter?
Current public guidelines in Israel and abroad need to be changed to reflect the importance of home monitoring of blood oxygen levels. Today, they state that COVID-19 patients should seek emergency medical care or return to the hospital after being released only if they experience symptoms such as ""trouble breathing"" and ""persistent pain or pressure in the chest."" These guidelines – including those of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the World Health Organization (WHO) – do not acknowledge the phenomenon of silent hypoxia. Moreover, waiting for symptoms to develop before seeking medical attention can result in arriving at the emergency department ""too late"" for effective treatment. 
Oximetry monitoring is not a panacea. Some COVID-19 patients who are monitored for blood oxygen saturation will develop into serious cases. In addition, certain conditions (such as dark skin pigmentation, certain skin dyes and nail-polish) can complicate oximeter readings and need to be taken into account. 
But knowledge is power. Thanks to what my family and I recently learned and thanks to the doctors who treated her, my daughter recovered from a near-fatal case of COVID-19. The main point is that the medical establishment in Israel and countries throughout the world need to explicitly publicize knowledge about the phenomenon of silent hypoxia and the use of home oximeters to the general public, as another measure to decrease the number of seriously ill patients and the preventable silent deaths from COVID-19.

ANKARA
We have known for a long time that hardships are indicative of strengths and weaknesses, the greatness and the baseness of individuals or societies who face them.
The COVID-19 outbreak unsurprisingly also revealed in France, among the elites as well as in the depths of society, in the presence of bright heroes and noble inclinations ... but also, inevitably, that of some less beautiful realities of all kinds.
Perhaps the most questionable of what the French government has done is to have chosen to deny the shortage of protective means in the country, such as masks which logically resulted from the weakened public hospital sector.
But they hide behind this and give false justifications such as one officially expressed by the government spokesperson that fellow French citizens do not know how to use them correctly.
More fundamentally, the global dimension of the crisis has reminded political elites of the universality of the viral challenge and, therefore, of the methods capable of responding to it.
Paris, which at first mocked with a very orientalist condescension the methods implemented by China -- ironic about their incompatibility with a democratic society -- had to quickly admit its fault.
This is, perhaps, the first great lesson of this exceptional episode: confession of fragility from the West, which teaches lessons to the planet.
Unsurprisingly, French society has also shown its two sides. In the supply chains, too many citizens piled up food products that were out of proportion to their needs, we thus witnessed scenes of rare incivility.
Among some unscrupulous traders, the sale of masks gave rise to an ugly black market.
Thanks to an explosion of initiatives, especially digital, French society has also shown an astounding inventiveness in restoring the social bond that has been undermined by distancing.
And France was able to demonstrate her gratitude towards the caregivers.
Not surprisingly, the crisis has, above all, revealed and exacerbated the social and political disparities which dangerously affect the living together of the French people: between the middle classes that can confine themselves to working from home and those who have to be physically present on the field that exposes them to high risks of contamination; and between the owners of vacation homes who spend hours in the countryside with the scent of vacation and those who, in narrow and overcrowded apartments, face infinitely more anxiety-provoking confinement and the increased risk of sanctions of all kinds.
It has thus worsened the situation in the suburbs, districts with dense habitat which has limited cultural and health facilities that France reserved for the African migrants.
In the Parisian suburb of Saint-Denis where a large proportion of the descendants of migrants from North Africa or sub-Saharan Africa, of Muslim culture reside, pay more than 10% of the national amount of fines for breaches of the rules of containment.
Far-right supporters forget that if the hospitals of the suburbs are overloaded, that is due to the glaring insufficiency of their number, not because of the religion or the behavior of its inhabitants.
Finally, just like Trump's voters and many others, the French society has closed in even more on its serious but very relative problems to the detriment of all consideration for the infinitely more painful hardships of others.
France, the birthplace of human rights, fortunately, stood up against an evil capable of killing between 2% and 3% of its citizens.
But the country continued to let Russian and Syrian regimes' bombs raining on the people of Syria's northwestern Idlib province, bombs that kill 100% women and children as they hit blindly.

2020-04-01,OPINION - COVID-19: Confession of fragility of West,,"A day after the first American case of COVID-19 was announced on January 21, Joe Kernen of CNBC asked US President Donald Trump, ""Are there worries about a pandemic at this point?"" Trump's response was short and sweet- ""No. Not at all. And we have it totally under control. It's one person coming in from China, and we have it under control. It's going to be just fine.""
But just 56 days down the line, Trump did a volte face and told reporters that ""This is a pandemic. I felt it was a pandemic long before it was called a pandemic."" So, now that even the world's most illustrious epitome of unbridled conceit and obduracy has accepted the reality, it's time for us lesser mortals do likewise.
But, doing so won't be easy a there seems to be a 'Trump' hidden in almost every person's psyche- concealed somewhere in the cerebrum, it (to use Trump's words), tells us ""I like this stuff. I really get it. People are surprised that I understand it. Every one of these doctors said, 'How do you know so much about this?' Maybe I have a natural ability. Maybe I should have done that instead of running for President.""
This explains why almost all of us continue to accept conspiracy theories, or trust bizarre remedies conjured by unknown social media addicts and even start believing charlatans with dubious antecedents who dish out unconvincing religious explanations for this pandemic and also provide highly unscientific (and at times equally obnoxious) cures.
Conspiracists
There are people who are naturally gifted with or have acquired a fertile imagination, but for a host of reasons haven't been able to accomplish their dreams of being recognized as the modern-day incarnation of Sherlock Holmes or Agatha Christie - and let me assure you, they're plenty of them.
Initially it was claimed that the COVID-19 virus had spread through consumption of bats or some other exotic breed of animals like the pangolin. But when this theory was challenged on the grounds that Chinese had traditionally been consuming these foods for centuries without ever having experienced such a pandemic, conspiracists had a field day to fill the information 'vacuum' with juicy renditions.
Resultantly, we have conspiracies galore; of how this virus accidentally leaked out while Chinese scientists were experimenting on ways to reduce its virulence to the extent that it only causes influenza that could be treated, so that it could be used to quell the Hong Kong protests.
One also hears of CIA's plan to secretly acquire samples of this mutated virus for America's own biological warfare program by bribing a Chinese scientist working at the Wuhan facility; of how the crowded Wuhan market was selected as the rendezvous where this virus sample would be handed over and how its contents were accidentally released into the air when the delinquent scientist was caught in the act and was being restrained by the Chinese authorities.
But besides conspiracies that indict the Chinese, there are other accounts that squarely blame America. One version talks about how the COVID-19 virus had actually leaked out from a US Biological Warfare facility at Fort Detrick in August 2019 infecting US Army soldiers. Some of those effected were part of the 280 strong US Army contingent that participated in the Military World Games held in Wuhan during October and these participants infected the Chinese by visiting Wuhan market.
To give this version greater authenticity, its proponents have even claimed that the Americans didn't even win a single medal at these games because they were suffering from COVID-19 and that empty bioweapon drums were recovered from US Consulate premises at Wuhan after it was vacated.
Godmen, preachers and their 'divine' expositions
Since time immemorial, humans have always associated natural calamities as the physical manifestation of the wrath of the Gods and despite rapid advances in science that gives a logical explanation for the same, the persistent strain of superstition deeply embedded in the human mind makes us vulnerable to hearsay, especially when it's couched in religious rhetoric.
This is largely because in every religion there is mention about the Almighty collectively punishing humans for having deviated from the prescribed path of righteousness, not as retribution but only to get them back on the right track. Although such belief tends to make one fatalistic, it nevertheless pacifies people as they ungrudgingly accept the prevailing crisis as being the wish of their creator. But the flip side is that such a mindset also gives godmen and opportunists an excellent chance of exploiting human vulnerabilities to pursue their own motivated agendas.
Are the Gods angry?
Tunisian cleric Bechir Ben Hassen holds that, ""The (COVID) virus is a soldier in Allah's army. Today, it's toppling people as if they were insects. The Chinese authorities imposed a siege on one million Uighur Muslims, and now 50 million Chinese are besieged because of the virus, and they can't find a cure for it because this is God's will.""
Rabbi Meir Mazuz has a different explanation - he believes that this pandemic is nature's way of punishing nations that allow LGBTQ parades. Another Rabbi named Shlomo Aviner tells us that since, ""man thinks he is God, that he is the master and can decide what is good and bad,"" the COVID-19 virus has been sent by our creator with the implied message that, ""let us see you fight the smallest of God's creations. This creation is called corona, a crown.""
Muslim Cleric Ilyas Sharafuddin from India says, ""Remember how they (Chinese authorities) have threatened the Muslims and tried to destroy lives of 20 million Muslims. Muslims were forced to drink alcohol; their mosques were destroyed and their Holy Book was burned. They (the Chinese) thought that no one can challenge them, but Allah the most powerful punished them.""
This view is endorsed by at least three clerics from the Middle East. But Syrian cleric Abd Al-Razzaq Al-Mahdi goes a step ahead by tweeting, ""God gave them a soldier (virus). And many of God's soldiers said, Glory be to Him … O God, increase their (the Chinese) suffering and affliction until they stop fighting your religion and worshipers.""
Good God!
Cures 'prescribed'
Social media is full of prescriptions guaranteeing prevention against contracting COVID-19 as well as a sure-shot cure for those afflicted by this virus. But while we may laugh at the ignoramus for blindly believing these misleading precautions and remedies, let's not forget that there are many well-educated people who claim to be blueblood rationalists end up abetting proliferation of fake news by blindly 'forwarding' such illogical posts on social media.
According to Televangelist Pat Robertson, consumption of sauerkraut (finely cut raw cabbage that has been fermented by various lactic acid bacteria) can prevent coronavirus as it is rich in probiotics.
This prescription may sound weird since no relation between coronavirus and probiotics has yet been conclusively established, but the next two prescriptions are downright gross. How can any educated person ever believe that what a cow excretes as waste can serve as complete remedy for a medical condition created by a deadly mutated virus like COVID-19? But yet, Ms Suman Haripriya, a legislator of India's Bhartiya Janata Party thinks so!
Similarly, Abbas Tabrizan (whom his supporters refer to as ""Ayatollah"" and hail as ""the father of Islamic medicine of Iran,"") is confident that coronavirus can be cured merely by applying violet oil to the anus!
One can only pray to God that better sense prevails amongst those who 'believe' in like of Ms Haripriya and Tabrizan!
Preachers or charlatans?
Lastly, while religious preachers need to understand that their illogical intransigence could well result in their congregation being exposed to grave risk of contracting coronavirus, followers need to guard against blindly following practices and rituals that are fraught with danger.
A few examples of such incidents that have come to light are mentioned below:
In South Korea, a secretive Christian sect called Shincheonji ignored government advice on precautionary measures against coronavirus and held a prayer service. Later, it admitted that media accusations of ""our 'unusual service style' (is) a reality where we had to hold service on the floor to maximize the number of occupants in our small space."" Investigation also revealed that the attendees were discouraged from wearing masks as it would offend God. Experts believe that since the attendees had come from all over the country, those infected during this service had transmitted the virus across the entire nation.In Iran, the outbreak of COVID-19 seems to have started in religious city of Qom. But rather than go in for quarantine as medically recommended, representative of Iran's Supreme Leader in Qom, cleric Mohammad Saeedi urged Iranians to visit Imam Reza shrine, saying that, ""We consider this holy shrine to be a place of healing. That means people should come here to heal from spiritual and physical diseases."" Several COVID-19 cases reported in Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Canada, Georgia, Iraq, Kuwait, Lebanon, Oman, Pakistan, and the United Arab Emirates have been linked to people who had visited Qom.In February, more than approximately 14,500 local and 1,500 foreign members of Tablighi Jamaat, which is one of the largest faith-based Islamic movements in the world, attended a four-day conclave for ""spiritual renewal"" in Malaysia. During this meet, devotees not only participated in mass prayers and partook community meals but also went out to preach. As a result, more than 600 local attendees tested positive for corona virus along with several others who had come from neighboring Brunei, Thailand and Singapore.
Unfortunately, despite worldwide awareness on the importance of 'social distancing', Kashmir's Grand Mufti, Nasir ul Islam's recent interview with Kashmir Reader indicates that even on the coronavirus issue he's very much remains a bundle of paradoxes. On the one hand he laments that ""Kashmir is ill prepared, has no infrastructure for controlling the virus if it enters the later stages. It has to be controlled at this stage only."" But even after acknowledging that ""Prevention is better than cure, no doubt,"" he turns into a pandemic expert and says, ""But the virus won't spread if a few people are offering prayers in a mosque.""
Tailpiece: While the Grand Mufti's assurance that ""we are concerned about people,"" is certainly reassuring, but when he in the same breadth adds that ""We are just figuring out the situation. A call will be taken if things get out of control,"" then he gives an impression that he firmly believes in the cavalier 'we shall cross the bridge when it comes' approach and that's when the real worry starts.

2020-03-25,"On Conspiracists, Curses, Charlatans And COVID-19 – OpEd",,"London: University College London, UK Government has issued the following news release:
At UCL, we have been applying the depth and breadth of our cross-disciplinary research and expertise to help the global effort in combatting COVID-19 and to make the world more resilient and equitable in the future.
One of the specific ways we have supported interventions against COVID-19 has been through making our research and data freely available around the world. UCL has a long-term commitment to innovative Open Science principles as we recognise the wider benefits for advancing knowledge and discoveries.
Determined to apply the Open Science ethos in the challenge to understand COVID-19, we were one of the first universities anywhere in the world to develop an online platform bringing together all our records for research on the pandemic into one place.
The UCL COVID-19 Research platform is managed on behalf of the UCL community by UCL Press, the UK's first fully Open Access University Press. The platform brings together records for published articles, pre-prints, working papers and reports from a global database maintained by ScienceOpen, which expands by more than one million records every month.
The platform uses metadata (catalogue descriptions) to pull in research from a range of outlets from traditional commercial journals to pre-print servers. Where the research is Open Access, the platform makes the full-text of the publication available.
This month (August), UCL's COVID-19 Research platform reached a landmark moment with 500 pieces of research recorded, and over 13,000 views to the platform.
The COVID-19 Research platform is a hugely important initiative in the context of the current pandemic. The sharing of research insights and information is crucial to enabling a global response to the current crisis.
We know this having learned lessons in previous pandemics. For example, later analysis of the Ebola crisis, that affected thousands of people particularly in Western Africa, showed that the sharing of research, data and information was poor. There was no central record of research findings, and many collections of research data were inaccessible.
These barriers to rapid information sharing affected the ways in which the virus was managed, controlled and treated.
UCL is determined that the same failures do not happen during the COVID-19 pandemic. We outlined our commitment in a statement on the importance of Open Science, published earlier this month.
UCL's COVID-19 Research platform is one of our gifts to the world, sharing our knowledge and wisdom across the globe for the benefit of all.","EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (99%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); NEGATIVE NEWS (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); EXPERIMENTATION & RESEARCH (78%); RESEARCH REPORTS (78%); EBOLA VIRUS DISEASE (73%); TROPICAL DISEASES (61%)

2022-09-14,What Are The Expert's Opinion After Covid 19 On Telemedicine Market?,,"World scientists are racing against time to look for a cure against Covid-19 as thousands die everyday.
One unusual source of cure worth looking into maybe the pine trees.
In a study conducted at the St Olga Municipal Paediatric Hospital, St Petersburg, the extract was found to promote quicker recovery from recurrent viral infections, with less severity.
Those who took the extract were also found to be less susceptible to intra-hospital infections, i.e. infections acquired while at hospital.
In a separate study done on healthcare workers in contact with tuberculosis (TB) patients, the extract helped enhance defence against the TB mycobacterium, thereby protecting these healthcare workers from infection.
As the world struggles with various opportunistic viral and bacterial infections, coupled with increasing resistance to antibiotics, the extract may just be that natural weapon needed in the arsenal of human resistance against microbes.
In the 1930s, Russian scientists Professor Fjodor Solodky and Dr Asney Agranat who worked together at the St Petersburg Forest Technical Academy observed pine trees for their ability to thrive and remain evergreen, even through severe weather conditions.
They discovered that certain ""live elements"" were found in pine conifer needles that enabled them to keep healthy.
When these scientists successfully extracted these ""live elements"", they were amazed to find that those same elements keeping pine trees strong and disease-free were almost identical to health-supporting elements found in human blood.
Not only is it easily absorbed and utilised by humans, it is also very safe to consume.
This original extract from pine conifer needles was later patented.
Ancient Medicine
Pine trees have long played a part in traditional medicine throughout the world.
Long before mankind took to decorating pine trees in preparation for Christmas, it was usual for pine trees to be set up in the middle of homes during winter.
It was believed that the volatile extracts from these trees served as natural disinfectants to clean the air and prevent the spread of colds and flu during the long European winters.
Although different parts of the pine tree are usable, it is the green pine needles that have been used therapeutically in various different cultures.
Found amongst the archives of traditional Chinese medicines from some 4,600 years ago, were formulas using pine needles as an ingredient for bronchitis and influenza.
There is a Taoist practice of surviving only on pine needles to gain supernatural powers that has its roots in the pine tree's symbolism of integrity and honour.
Some Native American tribes use pine needles to treat stomach aches.
On the other hand, the Scandinavians used pine branches in saunas, and many cultures stuff mattresses with pine needles to repel lice, fleas and other insects. In fact, pine needle mattresses are still used today in the Swiss Alps as a remedy for rheumatism.
Today, the research on pine needles as a therapeutic modality continues to inspire medical progress.
As Bread Additive
It was not long before Prof Solodky's and Dr Agranat's work produced valuable results. During World War II, in the 900 days that Leningrad (now called St Petersburg) lay under siege from the German army, the population of the city survived on a daily ration of 75g of bread.
The bread was made primarily from sawdust enriched with special food-grade cellulose and the pine green needle extract.
The people's daily ration also included one glass of water infused with the same bioactive extract.
The survival of the city and hundreds of thousands of its citizens was due largely to this pine needle extract.
After the war, successful trials lead to the extract being embraced in Russia as a wide- spectrum natural anti-microbial and anti-fungal preparation with powerful healing properties.
Although both Prof Solodky and Dr Agranat are no longer alive, the research programme they initiated has continued uninterrupted till today.
Who would have thought that pine needles, normally considered forestry waste, would hold such tremendous therapeutic potential?
Yet, over the last 80 years, the clinical evidence has shown that this natural substance has the potential to revolutionise the way we treat various different diseases today.
Pine Needles Against Acid Reflux
Acid reflux disease has risen by nearly 50% over the last decade, according to one of the largest studies ever conducted in Norway.
The study also highlighted the link between reflux, smoking and obesity.
With Malaysia being ranked the fattest country in South-East Asia and the sixth in the Asia-Pacific region, it is not surprising that the incidence of acid reflux here is up to 16% amongst Malaysians.
Acid reflux, gastritis and stomach ulcers are but some of the ways our digestive system signals distress.
In our fast-paced world demanding quick relief, we often resort to a gulp of antacids or popping an acid-blocking pill to deal with the immediate problem.
Unfortunately, such short-term measures only mask the pain, but do not go to the root of tummy troubles.
Professor Vladimir Bespalov, Chief of Cancer Chemoprevention at the N.N. Petrov Institute of Oncology in St Petersburg led a study that looked at treatments to improve pre-cancerous conditions of the stomach (atrophic gastritis).
In this research, patients with atrophic gastritis (stomach pre-cancer) and H. pylori were recruited. These patients were then treated with the pine needle extract and compared to a control group.
Those in the group treated with pine needle extract experienced the following:
Regression of dyspeptic symptoms (GERD) such as gastritis, acid reflux, gas and bowel disorders, in 92% of patients, along with a reduction in the endoscopic symptoms of gastritis.Improved stomach functionality in 58% of patients.Reduction in pre-cancerous lesions in 46% of patients.H. pylori eradication in 57% of patients.
Liver disease and hepatitis
Chronic liver disease is a significant global problem. In a study carried out at the Kazan Republican Infectious Diseases Hospital, Tatarstan, Russia, the addition of pine needle extract to treatment helped chronic hepatitis patients to recover faster and reduce the side effects experienced from liver drug therapy.
With such an extraordinary therapeutic profile, pine needle extract was almost a ""forever secret"" kept from the world's knowledge.
Although it has been part of the Russian pharmacopoeia since the 1950s, this research was a closely guarded secret within the shrouds of the tightly regulated former Soviet Union.
It was only through an inter-government scientific exchange programme with Australia and the fall of the Soviet Union that the pine needle extract was brought into the world's knowledge.
But before one rushes to pick up a fresh pine tree to devour its precious pine needle content, it has to be said that a special patented technology is employed to extract the delicate ""live elements"" contained in pine needles so as not to destroy its intrinsic activity.
Pine Needle Extracts Effective Against Animal Diseases
Pine needle extracts have been used for preventing and treating animal disease caused by viruses. The extract of pine needle of the present invention showed anti- viral effect of influenza A viruses, Newcastle disease virus, infectious bronchitis virus, avian pneumovirus, porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus, Coxsakie virus, reticuloendotheliosis virus, Aujeszky s disease virus, adeno virus and coxsakie virus in vivo and in vitro.

2020-04-27,Can Pine Trees Help Treat COVID-19? – OpEd,,"As the second wave of COVID-19 sweeps across Africa, bringing steep increases in infections and deaths, the battle between facts and conspiracies - especially around the safety of COVID vaccines - has also intensified.
For anyone who has worked on crop improvement in Africa over the last three decades, the flood of misinformation around vaccines evokes an eerie sense of déjà vu. It is reminiscent of the aggressively anti Genetically Modified Organism (GMO) campaign that has stalled Africa's efforts to improve the productivity and nutrition of key crops over the past three decades. Those of us working in the GMO field grossly underestimated the power of the misinformation campaign against it.
The failure to adopt GM crops has had a slow and degenerative effect on Africa, where farmers have not experienced the economic boons enjoyed by their counterparts in other parts of the developing world.
Two of us have deep expertise on GMOs; the third is a medical doctor and academic on the front lines of the fight against COVID in Nigeria. We're also all involved in science communication and believe there is much to learn from the GMO misinformation campaign in Africa. Our research and experience of seeing misinformation take root suggests there are six key lessons to be drawn here.
Six lessons
Get there first. Opinions, once formed, are difficult to change. It has been repeatedly demonstrated through experiments that few people change their minds even when confronted with solid facts that contradict their opinions. Most dig in deeper. Through the 1990s, scientists downplayed GMO misinformation spread by activist groups - and scepticism about GMO technologies continued to grow, despite overwhelming evidence on their safety.
With a new issue like the COVID-19 vaccine, opinions are being formed now. A recent survey of Africans found 79% of respondents would take a COVID-19 vaccine if it were deemed safe and effective. Hesitancy was based mostly on perceptions about trust, importance, safety and efficacy. We need to proactively inoculate against misinformation.
Confront suspicion of western technologies. Although farmers in the US grew the first biotech (GMO) crop, a technology bears no passport or national identity. Modern science is a global enterprise, relying on collaboration and diverse views. Yet there is a suspicion of GMOs - and now vaccines - that seems tied to its western origins, a mistrust of multinational corporations and wounds still unhealed from a colonial past of human exploitation.
Recently, trust for GMOs is emerging as national scientists in public agricultural research programmes develop homegrown biotech solutions for crops most relevant to the African context - cooking banana, cassava, and cowpea, and staples like maize. Similarly, scientists in Africa are finding local solutions to the COVID-19 pandemic, from low-cost ventilators to home diagnostic kits and vaccine research.
It is crucial to highlight the ingenuity and commitment of Africans advancing the frontiers of science in Africa, for Africa, to neutralise the false narrative that technology and innovation only happens in the west.
The messenger is as important as the message. Research shows we are more likely to trust or believe a person if they are similar to us in physical appearance. Unfortunately, white males have communicated much of the science around GMOs and the COVID-19 vaccine. Africa needs its own trusted messengers - men and women who reflect the continent's diversity. African scientists should be encouraged to move science beyond peer reviewed journals to engaging the public. They also must harness the power of social media -- a platform where anyone can be an ""expert"", yet too few bona fide experts invest in sharing science-informed perspectives in a vernacular that resonates with the public.
A picture is worth a thousand words. Well-curated pictures and infographics are key to effective message delivery. The purveyors of misinformation have mastered this craft. GMO media coverage, no matter how accurate the text, persistently includes a stock photo of a tomato being injected with a syringe. This image is itself misinformation: there are no GMO tomatoes on the market and GM crops are not developed by injections with syringes.
Similarly, photographs of vials and syringes are widely used in news reports about COVID vaccines, at the risk of provoking trypanophobia, a fear of medical procedures involving injections. The phenomenon is a real one that can significantly influence adults' decisions to vaccinate. Where is the image that conveys safe, well-tested science as the key to restoring pre-COVID normalcy? Photographs that show key figures, such as politicians, church leaders and celebrities, being vaccinated can go a long way in building confidence among the general population.
Counter the whac-a-mole phenomenon. The challenge of suppressing misinformation about GMOs has often and aptly been likened to ceaselessly playing whac-a-mole -- the 1970s-era arcade game that involved whacking moles with a rubber mallet as they randomly emerged from their holes. Continuously introducing new conspiracy theories -- no matter how wild -- is an effective strategy for spreading fear about new technologies. Now it's being repeated with COVID. Efforts must be sustained to confront new and multiple myths as they appear.
Focus on the problem. In presenting any new innovation to the public, utility is key. Though the first-generation GM crops -- 99% of which are insect-resistant and/or herbicide-tolerant global commodities -- provided direct benefits to farmers, they've suffered from a lack of perceived utility to consumers. It's no surprise that the anti-GM movements originated in the US and Europe, where few people farm, rather than in countries like Burkina Faso, where 86% of the population is engaged in the business of producing food. The drive to adopt technology, despite any perceived risk, increases when weighed against the benefits and utility.
In the context of the global pandemic, the decision to embrace a new technology, like a vaccine, is truly a matter of life and death. The focus must be on their utility. Vaccines save lives. They will reduce further economic suffering. They are simply the only pathway to return to our normal lives.
Lives are at stake
Now is the time to attack vaccine misinformation on social media, invest in robust science communication, engage scientists in public discourse, and inoculate the population with both a vaccine and the truth. Lives are at stake.

2021-03-08,Battling Misinformation Wars in Africa - Applying Lessons From GMOs to Covid-19 [opinion],,"The genie has escaped from the bottle, revealing the deep injustices and cruelties that are embedded in US capitalism and its warped relationship to the peoples it rules, and the world.
The coronavirus pandemic has upended the economy and the lives of millions of people. In so doing it has exposed the wreckage of a country living under the rule of billionaires and the military industrial complex. The health care system is controlled by corporations and therefore cannot meet human needs. The United States gave up its large scale manufacturing to China, the country which it both demonizes as the source of infection but also begs to produce more ventilators, masks and other medical equipment.
The response is what one would expect from a politically backward nation like the United States. The president is unqualified for his position and offers no leadership. Although pointing out Donald Trump's faults is too easy and cannot be the sole basis of any analysis. The systemic shortcomings impacting us now were all in place before he was elected. The oligarchy's rule over government is obvious and can no longer be kept hidden. The governmental remedies proposed to date are an effort to give corporations a massive bailout with no strings attached, but only meager crumbs for the people.
The chaos will eventually end but life will not be the same. A system that is inherently antagonistic to human needs is unlikely to return the few public benefits we had left. Disaster capitalism is quite real. Just as the New Orleans school system was replaced with charter schools after hurricane Katrina in 2005, the closing of schools due to COVID-19 may end with the same result across the country.
Charter school profiteers will argue that online learning is just fine and that children won't need class rooms or teachers anymore. Jobs that disappeared in the wake of business closings may never come back. If workers can function at home and communicate via teleconferencing, they may be told not to return to their places of employment again. Those who cannot utilize these systems will become redundant. The means of getting rid of the few benefits we still had will be endless.
It would be quite tragic if 2020 ended like any other year, with a belief that an electoral victory for one part of the duopoly will save us. The machinations of the democratic wing have been disgraceful, as they coalesced around an obviously ill man in order to crush demand for even a small bit of reform.
The presidential election must be one part of a wider campaign to bring true justice to this country. COVID-19 is an opportunity to demand change while the people are paying attention to the crisis. A return to normalcy is the opposite of what we need. This is a moment to think about what should be the new normal and what should be jettisoned forever.
In order to minimize the post-COVID-19 damage the list of demands must be formulated right now. These should include monthly payments for every person for the duration of the pandemic and continued support for those in need afterward. The health care system must be permanently placed under full public control. Medicare for all is a small part of what we need.Rent and mortgage payments must be suspended, and loans should be forgiven. Water and electricity shut offs should end and a right to these services must be established. The internet must become a regulated utility too.
It is a positive sign that some states are freeing prisoners. These actions are proof that the prison population could be cut in half at the very least without posing a danger to the public.This is another demand that must outlive the pandemic.
Most importantly, we cannot allow the removal of any pre-COVID-19 protections or claim that public education or other public benefit can be diminished at all. Schools must be reopened and fully staffed. The laid off must be returned to their old jobs.
The idea of American exceptionalism must die. China and Cuba are sending medical teams all over the world while the United States scrambles to provide for the basics. If Americans learn nothing else from this crisis they should observe that the countries they are told to hate and fear are doing what their ""great"" nation fails to do.
The genie cannot be stuffed back into the bottle. All the contradictions must be exposed and opposed. The demands for justice and real democracy should outlive this pandemic. If we wait and hope for one $1,000 check the deaths and illness will have been doubly tragic. This historic opportunity for transformational change must not be lost.

2020-03-30,Revolutionary Change And COVID-19 – OpEd,,"Russian Aluminium, a leading global aluminium producer, announced early February that its representative office in Guinea was awarded the Guinea Best Company Awards for its contribution to the fight against COVID-19 and socially responsible policy during the pandemic.
Since 2010, the Guinea Best Company Awards have been presented annually by the Think Tank of COPE-Guinée (Coordination of Guinean non-governmental organizations for the promotion of excellence) to 50 enterprises in Guinea and West Africa that have demonstrated significant achievements across various fields such as industry, economics and public life.
Assessing the results of 2020, the COPE-Guinée named Alexander Larionov, RUSAL General Director in Guinea, among the top 50 managers of commercial enterprises in the region. The results were based on indicators such as compliance with high standards of Corporate Social Responsibility during the pandemic, including the preservation of jobs, wages, social payments, investment projects, as well as the special contribution of enterprises to combat the spread of COVID-19 in Guinea.
The award ceremony was held in Conakry under the chairmanship of the High Representative of the Head of State, Claude Kory Kondiano, who noted in his speech: ""Entrepreneurs and businessmen play a leading role in the development of Guinea, which has made significant progress in many areas over the past 10 years under the leadership of President Alpha Conde. Today's ceremony is a great opportunity to pay tribute to the best of those who create jobs and support the national well-being of our country.""
Commenting on the RUSAL management in Guinea's award for its achievements in the field of Corporate Social Responsibility and the fight against COVID-19, Yakov Itskov, Director of RUSAL's Alumina Business, said: ""For 20 years, RUSAL has been successfully developing its business in Guinea and has always helped the country's residents in difficult times. In 2015, we built a state-of-the-art epidemiology center in Guinea to fight the Ebola epidemic, and in 2020, we opened another multi-functional infectious disease treatment center to counter COVID-19. We will continue to provide systematic support to Guinean healthcare, guided by the principles of social responsibility of business.""
In addition, in July 2020, RUSAL delivered medical humanitarian cargo intended to combat the spread of the COVID-19 epidemic. The cargo included dozens of medicines, as well as modern medical equipment and consumables for the treatment of patients with coronavirus.
In November 2020, RUSAL supplied two new ambulances to Guinea, both equipped for providing emergency medical care and resuscitation of patients, including ventilators. RUSAL was the first private company to assist Africa in fighting against the spread of dangerous infections.
During the Ebola epidemic outbreak in Kindia in 2015, RUSAL built the Centre for Epidemic and Microbiological Research and Treatment (CEMRT). The center has since been acknowledged nationally as one of the sites for the diagnosis and treatment of COVID-19 in Guinea, and received the first patients with coronavirus. In June 2020, the new multifunctional medical center for the treatment of infectious diseases was constructed in Fria.
RUSAL has been operating in the Republic of Guinea since 2001, and remains as one of the largest international investors in the country. In Guinea, RUSAL owns Compagnie des Bauxites de Kindia (CBK), as well as the Friguia bauxite and alumina production facility. In addition, RUSAL is continuing with the implementation of a project aimed at developing the world's largest bauxite deposit Dian-Dian in Boke. The proven reserves of this field amount to 564 million tons.

2021-02-15,RUSAL Receives Guinea 's Best Company Awards For Fight Against COVID-19 – OpEd,,"Sydney: Cumberland Council has issued the following news release:
Mayor Steve Christou has responded to an opinion piece that has appeared in today's Daily Telegraph in relation to COVID-19 “double standards.”
In the piece, Miranda Devine writes how Australians have been compliant with COVID-19 restrictions including places of worship with the implication that “everyone is treated the same.”
The comments come after NSW Health recently granted Auburn Gallipoli Mosque a special COVID-19 exemption to allow 400 worshippers to pray Friday Eid al-Adha prayers, while rejecting requests from St Mary's Cathedral to relax the 100-person rule.
Mayor Steve Christou said the rules around COVID-19 restrictions need to be consistently applied.
“I've been very clear about this and I made the same point several weeks ago. We either have a pandemic, which we acknowledge and adhere to the relevant health directives for one and all or we don't,” Mayor Christou said.
“This is just another case of double standards and highlights my original concerns. I don't understand how NSW Health can pick and choose who is at risk and who warrants an exemption. We just have to look at what is happening in Victoria to know that it is a situation we need to avoid at all costs.
“These decisions are ultimately a space for health officials but we will all have a part to play. As for local government, we are doing our bit to keep the community safe, and communicate to residents the latest government guidance and advice.”","COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); EPIDEMICS (78%); PUBLIC OFFICIALS (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (76%); ISLAMIC HOLIDAYS & OBSERVANCES (76%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (73%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (73%); EID AL-ADHA (71%); RELIGIOUS FACILITIES (71%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (69%)

2020-09-18,Response to opinion piece on COVID-19 restrictions,,"London: Institution of Occupational Safety and Health has issued the following news release:
Duncan Spencer, Head of Advice & Practice at IOSH, discusses the important role OSH professionals play in responding to the COVID-19 pandemic...
So, your workforce diminishes as people fall ill with COVID-19 or are obliged to isolate and you need to work with a skeleton staff. This means that you don't have enough resources to fully operate your safety management system or implement the full suite of risk controls.
What do you relax? What room do you have for compromise? Do arguments of reasonable practicability exist or apply to this situation?
These are important questions. It might be a time of national emergency, but that does not mean that laws are suspended. OSH professionals must think the situation through and provide sound advice to the Board of their organisation and pragmatic guidance to line management.
Organisations who are truly risk-led and evidence-driven are at an advantage in meeting the challenges of answering these questions. A well thought through risk register, founded on quality risk assessment and assembled to show the relative significance of the list, is the key.
For example, consider a retail distribution centre who is struggling to meet panic buying demand and who has a reduced employee number due to the virus. Management should first consider what is at the top of their OSH risk register e.g preventing unauthorised drive away from docking bays, or the safe use of pallet inverters. They would also review what is at the bottom of the list e.g risks associated with some housekeeping duties.
The focus on the top of the risk register would highlight controls that must not be compromised under any circumstances e.g traffic light systems and key control procedures must be enforced at docking bays. Consideration of the bottom of the risk register may reveal where control may be relaxed for a period or be covered by new controls e.g housekeeping procedures being more pragmatically controlled in this period by managers walking about and responding to conditions rather than normal procedural routines.
Management systems may also need modification. Less people and a busier environment may compromise the normal running of safety management systems, or key personnel may be absent. The OSH professional must take a lenient view on paperwork and process. Clarity is needed on what reporting can be dropped and which must be continued if the Board are to meet their governance and legal decision-making responsibilities. It may be prudent to announce which OSH projects will be paused during the crisis.",,439,Impact News Service
2020-03-26,Opinion: COVID-19 risk management implications,,"May 24, 2020( City Limits: http://www.citylimits.org Delivered by Newstex) ; COVID-19 has taught those of us working in affordable housing many lessons - one of the most important is that while New York City and State have been successful in creating and preserving thousands of affordable housing units over the past six years, we have to a large degree developed affordable housing in a silo. The underlying assumption in New York's affordable housing development program has been that decent, quality housing that is affordable is sufficient to help people stabilize their lives and move ahead in society.When one looks at the population which needs affordable housing, we know that the primary groups for which affordable housing is essential are those at the lower levels of the income scale and homeless people. These families and individuals need much more than a roof over their heads—they need a foundation under their feet. 
This foundation needs to include access to affordable health care and mental health services, job training and jobs, and social services. A first step in providing this foundation is to connect affordable housing with access to affordable health care. The coronavirus pandemic has shown that health care takes many forms : community-based health care, urgent care centers, walk-in clinics, hospitals, prescription medications both through traditional pharmacies and online services, and support teams that help individuals access this 'system' and support individuals on their journey to better health.This pandemic has underscored a critical weakness in how we plan and deliver affordable housing, namely that we haven't developed effective partnerships between housing and healthcare providers. With the exception of supportive housing, few if any affordable housing projects ensure that all tenants be enrolled in a health care plan or connected with a primary care provider.One barrier to making these connections has been the financing mechanisms used and the restrictions placed on how the funds can be used. Almost all of the affordable housing built in New York has been financed in large part with federal, state and city subsides: Low Income Housing Tax Credits, low interest loans and direct grants. In addition, many of the lowest-income tenants have rent subsidies from the government, such as HUD Section 8 vouchers, which have numerous limiting regulations. These subsidies were created by various levels of government to keep people housed; however, they have failed to recognize the importance of health care as an essential element in stabilizing people's lives.The Citizens Housing and Planning Council (CHPC) recently issued a policy paper which urges partnerships between affordable housing projects and hospitals and overhauling the city's affordable housing lottery system to 'make housing placement quicker and target affordable housing to meet our policy goals.' These are essential elements of creating a closer working relationship between health care and housing programs/resources.In addition to the CHPC recommendations, we should look at existing resources, such as the large number of community-based healthcare providers, which focus more on prevention and are more accessible than hospitals and are poised to serve many more health care consumers than they currently have enrolled. Telemedicine extends their ability to reach underserved populations and provides increased opportunities to employ physician assistants and certified nurses. CityViews[1] are readers' opinions, not those of City Limits. Add your voice today![2] Since most of the affordable housing in the city was and is being built with an investment of city and state funds, the city and state should consider making it a requirement that tenants who live in housing built using initial capital funding or ongoing rent subsidy support enroll with a primary healthcare provider. While a requirement such as this might be viewed as an invasion of privacy, the COVID-19 pandemic has demonstrated that without clear rules about how to prevent and contain the spread of disease, the whole society loses. This is a time when the 'greater good' has to prevail or we will fail as a democratic society.To support this expanded definition of quality housing, for tenants who are Medicaid eligible or in private health insurance plans, the cost would be covered by these plans. If the tenant (or prospective tenant) is uninsured, then Mayor de Blasio's health care initiative to cover all New Yorkers could be accessed. We should also explore the willingness of major healthcare insurance systems to consider alternative healthcare and financing models for serving this population and supporting linkages between housing and health care providers.New Yorkers can learn from some experiments in linking housing and health care, chiefly on the West Coast. Low Income Investment Fund's (LIIF) report 'Innovative Models in Health and Housing' provides case studies of local governments requiring linkages to healthcare providers before providing public financing for theaffordable housing project. Some of the investments to ensure this health linkage have come from health care providers and insurers, such as Kaiser Permanente. This approach appears to have been effective in ensuring that the tenants have a health care provider at the outset of their tenancy. Many of these projects have not utilized Federal Low-Income Housing Tax Credits so that they did not run afoul of the LIHTC regulations that prohibit targeting certain populations, such as vulnerable populations. We need to be creative and develop financing approaches that don't create these hurdles.It is clear that we need to step back and look not just at how to finance and build affordable housing, but also at what low-income tenants need, particularly when it comes to healthcare, and how to provide these services in a comprehensive way from the beginning - not as an afterthought. The COVID 19 pandemic boldly underscores the need for housing and health to be coordinated at the front end of planning a development project and how to develop connections between health/housing programs in existing affordable housing developments.Claire Altman is the president of Altman Strategies LLC.

2020-05-24,Opinion: COVID-19 Shows the Need to Combine Housing with Healthcare,,"The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna's candidate Gotabaya Rajapaksa convincingly won the presidential election held on November 16, 2019. He polled 52.25 percent votes as opposed to his arch-rival, Sajith Premadasa's 42 percent votes. Without wasting too much time, the president installed a new government headed by the SLPP, and Mahinda Rajapaksa was appointed Prime Minister. As soon as the presidency was won and the new administration formed, the SLPP's quest became winning a two-thirds majority in the general election, which was to take place in early 2020. 
On December 4, 2019, Amanda Hodge reported that President Rajapaksa ""is widely believed to be seeking a two-thirds majority in parliament...""(1) The government ministers were frank about the need to win such a majority. G.L.Peiris, Chairman of the SLPP, declared that the government would secure a two-thirds majority in the forthcoming election. He said a two-thirds majority was needed not to enjoy privileges but to serve the public efficiently.(2) Minister Prasanna Ranatunga maintained that ""a new government with a two-thirds majority should be elected at the general election. It is only then can a constitutional amendment be made to save the country.""(3)
Why Do They Need a Two-Thirds Majority?
The government could achieve many objectives with a two-third majority in parliament. It would assist the government to, for example, consolidate the unitary character of the state. However, the new government does not hide its objective in seeking a two-thirds majority from the Sri Lankan electorate. It wants to do away with the 19th Amendment to the Constitution. The Amendment was introduced by the previous government, which won the election in 2015 on the promise of good governance (yahapalanaya).
I believe that three specific elements in the 19th Amendment irk the government: (1) the reduced executive powers of president, (2) independent commissions, and (3) reduced presidential term.
The 19th Amendment seriously diluted presidential powers. For example, originally, the president had the executive powers to appoint and remove the prime minister and members of the cabinet of ministers. The prime minister and a member of the cabinet of ministers could be removed ""by a writing under hand of the President."" Under the new scheme, the president lost that power. Now the prime minister could be removed only if he or she resigns or ceases to be a member of parliament. The 19th Amendment also reestablished the Constitutional Council. With the reestablishment of the Councils, the president could not make major public service appointments without the approval of the CC. The Amendment also reduced the presidential term from six years to five years and limited the time in office to only two terms. Therefore, the 19th Amendment severely dented the power, strength, and prestige of the presidency. Rajapaksas liked none of them. Hence, the desire to repeal the 19th Amendment, which requires a two-thirds majority.
Electoral Reality
Can the SLPP win more than 150 seats in the 225-seat parliament?  In October 2019, I predilected that ""Gotabaya is more likely to win the presidential election...""(4) One of the assumptions that enabled the prediction was that major political parties in Sri Lanka have permanent vote banks, and they only marginally shift. A possible vote a candidate could poll was calculated based on the existing political configurations at that time. The same political configuration remained after the presidential election, especially within the SLPP led alliance.
Newly elected presidents in Sri Lanka like to go for the general election almost immediately because euphoria created by the (presidential) election victory has the potential to boost the chances of the president's party in the parliamentary election. Gotabaya Rajapaksa could not do that because the 19th Amendment prevented him from dissolving the parliament immediately. Therefore, the government could not take advantage of an immediate general election.
Also, the UNP split into two. Sajith Premadasa formed his own party/alliance called the Samagi Jana Palavegaya (SJP) while the UNP remains and will contest the general election under Ranil Wickremesinghe. The split in the main opposition party also unlikely to fetch too many votes to the SLPP. The UNP votes will break into two.  
Therefore, I assumed that the SLPP led alliance would garner about the same number of votes in the general election as well. Applying those votes to the general election template indicated that the ruling party would get only about 125 votes.
What this means is, had Sri Lanka proceeded with the plans for the general election in April 2020, the SLPP would have won the polls with a comfortable majority, but would have failed to get enough seats (150) to amend the Constitution. In that sense, an April 2020 election would have ended as a disappointment to the government.

It was against this backdrop, the COVID19 hit Sri Lanka bringing the system along with its politics to a standstill. As expected, President Gotabaya Rajapaksa dissolved parliament on March 2, and the fresh election was scheduled for April 25. However, due to the COVID19 pandemic, the general election was postponed indefinitely by the Elections Commission of Sri Lanka. Since the election could not be held on time, there was a call to reconvene parliament, which the president refused.
Therefore, Sri Lanka remains without an elected national body. As of today, no one knows when the election will be held. The government and the Election Commission expects the other to fix the new date. No political party is campaigning for the election as the prevailing scenario is not conducive for campaigning. Opposition parties adopt a muted attitude in relation to the government response to the COVID19 crisis. Hence, the COVID19 seems to have frozen Sri Lankan politics.

Now, we know the general election will be held sooner rather than later, most likely sometime in 2020. What would be the impact of COVID19 on the results of the forthcoming general election? It seems the crisis has strengthened the government's fortunes in the election. In general, natural catastrophes are bad for governments in power. People are dissatisfied with what they endured and react against the incumbent government. This could happen to the SLPP as well. Theoretically, it could win less than 125 seats when the election is conducted.
However, the reaction from Sri Lanka indicates that many people are satisfied with the way the government, especially President Rajapaksa, has handled the crisis. People tend to compare this government's performance with the yahapalana government. The comparison or the comparative analysis favors the SLPP government. Even the opposition parties are in praise. For example, Sajith Premadasa pointed out that ""the entire state apparatus, led by health authorities and the security forces, have so far been able to keep the number of infections controlled and deaths at a minimum.""(5)
Internationally also it seems to be getting high marks for its COVID19 response. For instance, the GRID Index (Tracking the Global Leadership Response in the COVID19 Crisis) ranked Sri Lanka as one of the top ten countries to deal with the crisis effectively. Moreover, the crisis enabled the government to deliver handouts to voters in the name of crisis relief. The point is that these factors could become handy for the government in the general election.
Therefore, in the backdrop of the COVID19 crisis, the government is more likely to fare well in the post-COVID19 general election. It seems the government would win more than 125 seats if the election is held in, for example, May 2020. Space has been created to win a two-thirds majority. But, would it win such a majority? No one knows.

The post Sri Lanka Politics: Frozen by COVID-19 - OpEd appeared first on Eurasia Review.",,1396,Newstex Blogs
2020-04-20,Sri Lanka Politics: Frozen by COVID-19 – OpEd,,"I have been following the advice of the health experts and avoiding trips outside the home - unless it's absolutely necessary.
I am proud to say that I've managed to go to only one major outside event and one private outing in the past two weeks. At both places, the anti-Covid protocols were fully observed and I was left in no fear that maybe I shouldn't have gone.
However, going to one of the events meant depending on a car service for transport. My first objection to some of these cars is that they are so tiny that I feel unsafe in them.
It's no use telling me that the cars have been certified as safe by the authorities in the countries where they are made. For neither Spain nor South Korea (from where most of these tin-boxes are imported) would tolerate road standards as atrocious as ours.
But even if our roads were up to standard, it's important that a passenger should feel safe and comfortable in a car. For most people are hard-wired to be neurotic. So we should not be forced to pay for services that put us in an uncomfortable mental situation. This means that our licensing authorities should take psychological factors into consideration when allowing certain types of vehicles to be used for commercial purposes in our cities.
Those with a long memory will recall that Accra taxis were once noted both for their quality and comfort. The most popular car used for taxis in the pre-independence era and the years immediately after, was the Morris Oxford Series 2. This car had leather seats. So its competition had to have something else. And they did, for they were fairly luxurious mainly Opel Kapitans and Mercedes 180s.
Later on, Russian-made ""Volga"" cars were imported to be used as taxis. Unfortunately for our Government, the Volga cars had a rather high front-end, and when they were cruising, they looked like prancing horses. So, Ghanaians, well-known for their wicked sense of humour, rechristened them ""Pá´nká´ abá´ dam"" [the horse has gone crazy!) Needless to say, they were soon sidelined.
Anyway, I became almost immediately angry when I got into a tiny car to go out on Sunday afternoon. For when I asked the driver to help me to fasten my rather stiff safety belt, he said to me: ""It would dirty your trousers!"",
""So you know it's dirty and yet you're on the road using the car to make money?"" Needless to say, all thought of enjoying myself that afternoon was driven from my mind and replaced with resentment.
My heart was in my mouth all the way to my destination. Suppose the car had a crash? I would be tossed through the windscreen like a piece of - what?
Believe it or not, my return journey home was even worse. The car did not have air-conditioning and,, without my knowing it, the driver had opened the window on my side.
""What's wrong with your air-conditioning?"" I asked on noticing this. I knew from past experience that he would say the A.C. had ""run out of gas"" and that he would go and ""refill"" it next week.
But I was wrong! Instead, he gave me a completely new excuse which previous drivers had never given to me: ""The motor has stopped working,"" he said.
The motor? I would have laughed and let the matter rest, except that when we entered a traffic jam, a persistent seller of something or other (I had turned my head away on seeing him so I couldn't tell what he was selling!) poked his head right into the car - yes - and shouted into my breathing space, ""Master,, buy some!""
You've guessed it - the fellow was not wearing a face mask! And that threw me!
I therefore applaud the President, Nana AddoDankwaAkufo-Addo, in his charge to us, in his 19th Covid-19 broadcast, not to let ""our guard down"" because we have heard that a second wave of Covid-19 has hit Europe and America, but not us. It might hit us too of we are not careful, the President emphasised.
He noted that three weeks ago, in his ""Update No.18"", he had indicated that the number of recorded active Covid-19 cases (that is, persons with the virus) was ""in decline"" in Ghana. The statistics were ""pointing to the fact that we were on the path towards defeating the virus."" Andd our nation, in the weeks prior to that address, ""had become accustomed to this downward slide of active cases.""
However, ""in recent weeks, a gradual change in the trajectory of the virus"" had been observed. There was ""an increase in active cases from the three hundred and ninety-eight (398) cases recorded three weeks ago, to one thousand, one hundred and thirty-nine (1,139) active cases, as at Friday, 6th November 2020"".
The number of daily infections was ""on the rise, from an average of twenty-five (25) new cases per day then, to an average of over one hundred and thirty (130) new cases per day in the course of the last two weeks.""
These figures gave cause for concern - in view of what was happening in Europe and America, namely, ""the outbreak of a second wave of infections"" that was engulfing many countries.
Over here, scientists at the West African Centre for Cell Biology of Infectious Pathogens, at the University of Ghana, Legon, collaborating with the Noguchi Memorial Institute for Medical Research, who are studying the genetic make-up of the virus in Ghana, had established that the virus had not changed. However, ""a reduction in compliance with the preventive protocols account for the increase in infections.""
The President went on: ""Fellow Ghanaians, it appears that we are letting our guard down. Now more than ever, we have to adhere to mask-wearing, hand-washing, the use of sanitizers, and social distancing protocols that have become a part of our daily routines, and which has ensured that we do not impose, all over again, the restrictions we are seeing in other parts of the world.""
So, it is over to us. We must renew our relentless effort to contain Covid-19. When we see the mistakes that certain Governments (such as the UK and the US) have made in their own approach to the problem, we must thank our luck stars that our own Government appears up to the onerous task of ensuring our safety from the virus. We must do our bit, as a populace, to support the Government's efforts.
In return, the Government, on its part, must be ready to unleash strict punishment on all those who insist on flouting the rules that ensure our collective safety. Without sanctions, some people will deliberately endanger others - people like the vendor who poked his head into my car window, just to sell me something I didn't want!
We deserve better than that, from our law enforcement agencies.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (78%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (78%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (78%); MEMORY (78%); SAFETY (78%); AUTOMOTIVE EXPORTS & IMPORTS (75%); HORSES (65%); LICENSES & PERMITS (51%); Ghana (%); Coronavirus (%)

2020-11-10,Letting Our 'Guard Down' Over Covid-19 [opinion],,"With more than one million reported COVID-19 deaths and enormous collateral damage to public health, education, and the economy, our pandemic response was a disaster. Yet some House Democrats are now defending the Trump administration officials responsible for initiating those misguided policies.
Two Trump-appointed officials—former CDC director Robert Redfield and White House Coronavirus Response Coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx—formally directed the federal response from the start of the pandemic through January 2021. They adopted lockdowns, including school and business closures, as the centerpiece of the national coronavirus response. In a recent report, Democrats on the Congressional Select Subcommittee on the Coronavirus Crisis defended these Trump officials. In doing so, they reiterated the misunderstandings underpinning the Birx-Redfield-Fauci strategy.
The Trump officials made two fundamental mistakes. First, they failed to prioritize protecting older Americans from a disease that had an infection fatality rate more than a thousand times higher for the elderly than for the young, leading to many unnecessary deaths.
Unlike Ebola, but similar to influenza and previously circulating coronaviruses, it was never possible to suppress COVID-19 to achieve ""zero COVID."" Many countries tried, but not one succeeded. Lockdowns only prolonged the pandemic. Despite harsh government lockdowns, extensive contact tracing, and constant anxiety-inducing warnings, most Americans got infected. Inevitably so.
With their singular focus on COVID suppression, Birx, Redfield, and Anthony Fauci failed to implement measures to protect older, high-risk Americans. They praised governors who ordered hospitals to discharge COVID-infected patients to nursing homes, where they infected other residents. Excess staff rotation spread the virus both within and between nursing homes. Instead of implementing daily testing at nursing homes, Birx, Redfield, and Fauci used limited resources to test asymptomatic children and students. It was only when Dr. Scott Atlas arrived at the White House in July 2020 that the government made more tests available to nursing homes.
When enough people recover from COVID, the country reaches herd immunity. After that, the disease becomes endemic, like other coronaviruses that cause occasional colds. Since the Birx-Redfield-Fauci strategy led to mass infection and eventual herd immunity, it is curious that congressional Democrats now claim these Trump officials were opposed to a ""herd immunity strategy."" The truth, now obvious to all, is that all COVID strategies lead to herd immunity. That is how pandemics end.
Drs. Birx, Redfield, and Fauci also turned a blind eye to the enormous collateral damage caused by their policies: missed cancer screenings and treatment, worse cardiovascular disease care, fewer childhood vaccinations, and deteriorating mental health, to name a few examples. Instead of pointing out those failures in the report, the congressional Democrats disparage Dr. Atlas for his concern about them.
In their futile efforts to suppress the disease, these officials' worst failure was the strategy of school closures. Missing school causes enormous harm to kids, particularly poor and middle-class children. Research predicts they will live shorter, poorer, and less healthy lives as a consequence of the closures. Unfortunately, only a few states, such as Arkansas, Florida, and Wyoming, resisted the Birx-Redfield-Fauci school closures.
In August 2020, along with Prof. Joseph Ladapo then of UCLA and Prof. Cody Meissner of Tufts University, we visited the White House to argue for better protection of older Americans and for opening schools and universities. While we met with the president and the vice president, we were surprised that neither Birx, Redfield, nor Fauci were available to meet with us. From the subcommittee report, we now know that Birx offered ""to go out of town or whatever gives the [White House] cover"" to avoid meeting with us.
Why would the federal COVID coordinator not meet with scientists who have decades of public health and infectious disease experience? Why do congressional Democrats condone behavior that one may expect from junior high students? They should be encouraging frank discussions among scientists about a major public health crisis. As a lab scientist, Fauci was understandably unaware of long-established public health measures to protect the vulnerable, but he failed to ask around and learn from public health scientists.
Whether one approves or disapproves of Donald Trump, many view the response to the pandemic as his administration's biggest failure. This response was coordinated by the White House task force on the coronavirus, with Vice President Mike Pence as the chair and with Birx, Redfield, and Fauci as key members with medical backgrounds.
The verdict is in, and it is now obvious that they failed. With more focus on protecting the old while keeping schools, health care, and small businesses open, Republican Florida and Nebraska and social-democratic Scandinavia have less collateral damage without higher excess mortality.
Birx and Redfield failed to protect older Americans from COVID-19. They failed to protect us all, especially our children, from collateral lockdown damage. They failed to listen and learn from other scientists. In 2020 they misled many Americans, both Republicans and Democrats. Surprisingly, congressional Democrats are now the ones stepping in to defend these Trump appointees. They should instead embrace independent-minded scientists who favored focused protection instead of lockdowns.

2022-07-12,Democrats Defend Trump Officials' COVID-19 Response | Opinion,,"It has dominated news cycles, debates and policies since 2020, but COVID-19 continues to exercise the interest of number crunchers and talliers. While the ghoulish daily press announcements about infections and deaths across many a country have diminished and, in some cases, disappeared altogether, publications abound about how many were taken in the pandemic.
The World Health Organization, ever that herald of dark news, has offered a revised assessment across of the SARS-CoV-2 death toll associated either directly or indirectly with the pandemic. Between January 1, 2020 and December 31, 2021, the global health body suggests that the mortality figure is closer to 14.9 million, with a range of 13.3 million to 16.6 million.
The number considers excess mortality, the figure reached after accounting for the difference between the number of deaths that have occurred, and the number expected in the absence of the pandemic. It also accounts for deaths occasioned directly by COVID-19, or indirectly (for instance, the pandemic's disruption of society and health systems).
The impact, as expected, has been disproportionate in terms of which countries have suffered more. Of the excess deaths, 68% were concentrated in 10 countries - Brazil, Egypt, India, Indonesia, Peru, Russia, South Africa, Turkey, and the United States. Middle-income countries accounted for 81% of excess deaths; high-income countries, for 15%, and low-income countries, 4%.
The United States, if only for being ascendant in terms of power, wealth, and incompetence in dealing with the virus, finds itself in the undistinguished position of having lost a million people. ""Today,"" remarked President Joe Biden, ""we mark a tragic milestone here in the United States, one million COVID deaths, one million empty chairs around the family dinner table, each irreplaceable, irreplaceable losses, each leaving behind a family, a community forever changed because of this pandemic.""
Chief Medical Adviser to the President, Anthony Fauci, rued the fact that ""at least a quarter of those deaths, namely about 250,000"" might have been saved by vaccinations. He also warned about the ugly prospect of a resurgence in numbers, and not bringing ""down our guard"".
In light of such figures, WHO Director-General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, reiterates the line he and his colleagues have done so for months. Pandemics demand more ""resilient health systems that can sustain essential health services during crises, including stronger health information systems"". His organisation ""was committed to working with all countries to strengthen their health information systems to generate better data for better decisions and better outcomes."" Much of this will be wishful thinking.
Figures, certainly when they concern matters of mortality, can become the subject of bitter dispute. COVID-19 has proved no exception. In Africa, 41 of 54 countries reported insufficient data. Some countries have released incomplete data sets; others, none to speak of. This meant, inevitably, that the WHO's Technical Advisory Group for COVID-19 Mortality Assessment could only model the missing figures to fill gaps.
As a result scrapping and arguments over methodology duly emerged. India, for one, has very publicly objected to the way the WHO has approached the compilation, communicating its concerns in no less than six letters between November 2021 and March 2022 and in a number of virtual meetings. Concerns have also been registered by WHO Member States, including China, Iran, Bangladesh, Syria, Ethiopia and Egypt.
The case with India is particularly telling, given WHO modelling showing 4,740,894 excess deaths, almost triple that of New Delhi's own figures. Such figures imply, as epidemiologist Prabhat Jha of the University of Toronto claimed back in January, that the authorities were ""trying to suppress the numbers in the way that they coded the COVID deaths.""
In an indignant statement from the Union Health Ministry released early this month, much is made of ""how the statistical model projects estimates for a country of geographical size & population of India and also fits in with other countries which have smaller population."" This constituted an unacceptable ""one-size-fits-all approach and models which are true for smaller countries like Tunisia may not be applicable to India with a population of 1.3 billion.""
The WHO model also returned two highly varied sets of excess mortality estimates when using data from Tier 1 countries and when using data from 18 Indian states that had not been verified. ""India has asserted that if the model [is] accurate and reliable, it should be authenticated by running it for all Tier 1 countries"" and the ""result of such exercise may be shared with all Member States.""
WHO assistant director general for emergency response, Ibrahima Soće Fall, concedes that any accurate picture is only as complete as the data provided. ""We know where the data gaps are, and we must collectively intensify our support to countries, so that every country has the capability to track outbreaks in real time, ensure delivery of essential health services, and safeguard population health.""
The degree of fractiousness that persists in public health shows that sharp fault lines remain in each country's approach to the pandemic problem. Disunity and factionalism, petty nationalism and self-interest, remain imperishable, even at the direst of times. And all governments, given the chance, will err on the side of inaccuracy rather than risk acute embarrassment.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); DEATH RATES (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (89%); HEALTH CARE INFORMATION (89%); DEATH & DYING (78%); ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES & WORKERS (78%); INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS & BODIES (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (77%); SARS (76%); VACCINES (73%); HEALTH CARE INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY (72%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (72%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (71%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (63%)

2022-05-16,Morbid Matters: Estimating COVID-19 Mortality – OpEd,,"EGLIN AIR FORCE BASE, Fla., May 15 -- Eglin Air Force Base issued the following news release:
Team Eglin added a second complication to the annual hurricane exercise May 6-14, by conducting the event while reviewing COVID-19 protocols and procedures.
The exercise was one of the first held in the Air Force since the corona virus global pandemic began.
Maj. Kelly Mattie, emergency operations center director, said all emergency operations strategies related to the virus were scrutinized.
""We had some good lessons learned after Hurricane Michael, and made several revisions to our hurricane plan,"" Mattie said. ""However, in our first hurricane exercise to test the revisions, we had a real-world COVID-19 contingency mixed in.""
All regulations, instructions, procedures, plans and policies related to COVID-19, as applicable during a hurricane, were thoroughly reviewed during the exercise, according to Tech. Sgt. Jacob Urry, Hurrex director.
""We insured they were all clear, pertinent and adaptable to given scenarios and executed appropriately,"" he said. ""We did it safely, without as much physical interaction as in past exercises.""
Exercise planning was conducted virtually. In one scenario, three nearby states were eliminated as evacuation destinations due to the virus, Urry said. This prompted planning evacuations to secondary locations.
""Participation from base units and tenants was awesome,"" Urry said. ""It helps exercise structure and execution when information sharing and effective communication practices are in place.""
Mattie said limitations caused by the virus to certain contingency and emergency operations were addressed. EOC manning was streamlined, checklists were reviewed and virtual connections were ramped up during the exercise, he added.
This year, deployment of equipment and personnel movement to aircraft evacuation or hurricane relief sites, was simulated.
During the hurricane, equipment and the personnel who move with it, departing and returning to the base, did so according to 96th Medical Group and the Center for Disease Control guidelines, Mattie said. All movements are evaluated in accordance with COVID-19 risk levels.
Processes for sheltering people off-base and care for recovery team personnel who could contract the virus, were reviewed.
Mattie encouraged base personnel to heed all COVID-19 information disseminated by their leadership. As teleworking is now a reality, he encouraged close monitoring of all communication channels and social media platforms during a real hurricane.
""We balanced the real-world COVID-19 situation with the hurricane exercise,"" Mattie said. ""The exercise allowed the 96th Test Wing staff to think deeper about preparing for an actual event. A lot of good lessons came from the exercise and Team Eglin has a strong plan, going forward.""

2020-05-15,EGLIN EXERCISES HURRICANE OPS UNDER COVID-19 GUIDELINES,,"Two years ago, in 2019, I made 10 round trips from the United States to Japan and back. In January and February of 2020, I went twice. Yet in the 22 months since then, I have not crossed the Pacific even once.
 For me, there is always Zoom. I have done seminars, and graduations, and even ""bonenkai"" year-end parties that way. Webinars are not quite the same as meeting face to face, but they do help me to preserve existing friendships.
 My Japanese colleagues and I remember our associations from before COVID-19 began disrupting our lives. And nine years of having lived in Japan make the sights and sounds of the country second nature to me, even when I experience them over the internet.
 For my students, however, many of whom do not know Japan at close hand, things are different. They lack the instinctive feel that flows from direct personal contact; the affection of previously developed human ties; and the commitment to Japan studies that flows from time and effort already expended.
 Young people, of course, also generally lack the financial resources to withstand prolonged uncertainty. And in a global world, they have other places where they can potentially go.
 Roughly three million people around the world are currently studying Japanese. Close to 30,000 of them typically came to Japan annually to improve their language fluency, to travel about the country, or to pursue extended technical study.
 Yet, during the first half of 2021, only 7,000 new foreign students entered Japan, down almost 89 percent from 2019. As many as 25,000 international students have reportedly been denied entry over the past two years, with their futures in limbo, due to COVID-19 border measures.
 Japan is currently the only G-7 nation not issuing student visas for foreign students, with a partial exception for government scholarships.
 The health considerations that have driven Japanese authorities to be cautious about border restrictions during the pandemic are, in the main, fully understandable. Japan, after all, has many vulnerable citizens -- almost 30 percent are 65 years of age or older.
 Japan, with an average age of nearly 46, is the oldest major nation in the world. And many of its citizens do also have special health vulnerabilities, apart from advanced age. Everyone must agree that proper precautions such as PCR tests and vaccinations should be observed.
 There are, however, rising costs in extremely cautious policies that may not be clearly visible now, but that could complicate Japan's relations with the world in future years.
 Half a century ago U.S. Ambassador to Japan Edwin O. Reischauer, my academic mentor, wrote of a ""broken dialogue"" with Japan. An overly cautious approach to cultural dialogue could contribute to a re-emergence of such dangers across the Pacific once again.
 I can see some of those still scarcely visible perils myself, among my students, who are finding it harder, amidst the frustrations of the pandemic, to sustain their deep enthusiasm about studying Japan.
 One of my best Johns Hopkins University undergraduate students, for example, has studied the Japanese language for six years, since her early high-school days, and was admitted in the fall of 2019 to the University of Tokyo to begin her studies there in April 2020.
 She could not go on time, of course, due to the pandemic, and successfully applied twice in succeeding admission cycles over the following two years, without being able to enter Japan.
 Recently, however, after the latest disappointing response from the immigration authorities in Tokyo, she gave up studying in Japan and decided to attend Yonsei University in South Korea instead. South Korea, with more liberal student admission policies than Japan, admitted 68,000 foreign students in 2020, several times Japan's level, while keeping COVID-19 under strict control.
 Japan now has one of the highest vaccination rates in the world, at nearly 77 percent. COVID-19 fatalities, at less than 19,000, are comparatively low, and infections since this past September have been falling sharply.
 The new Omicron variant, of course, introduces new uncertainties, and Japan justifiably needs to be careful. Restrictions on inbound foreign travel, after all, have been pervasive around the world, including the United States.
 No doubt the short-term political pressures to be conservative on COVID-19 border restrictions are powerful in animating Japanese policy, as elsewhere in the world. More than 80 percent of the Japanese public, for example, supported Prime Minister Fumio Kishida's decisive late November revival of a longstanding ban on foreign visitors to Japan, following the discovery of the Omicron variant.
 His popularity rose above the important 60 percent support mark for the first time following these steps. Given the uncertainties about Omicron, Japan's decision to extend restrictions on inbound travel until the end of December seem not only reasonable in health-policy terms, but also inevitable in the internal calculus of Japanese politics.
 Over the longer term, however, as the pandemic wanes Japan needs to consider seriously the quiet yet very real costs to its relations with the world that ambiguous or overly rigid border restrictions on health care grounds could potentially inflict.
 Japan, as more than four decades of study have taught me personally, is a fascinating, remarkable, yet subtle nation that can only be understood well through direct personal contact, including immersion -- on the spot -- in its language and culture.
 And in a global world, there are numerous alternative options to the study of Japan, especially for young, flexible, international students. They need a clearly welcoming environment to encourage and give momentum to their study.
 Prime Minister Kishida, as Japan's longest-serving former foreign minister across modern history, no doubt appreciates the importance of durable global ties for Japan.
 Indeed, there will be no better way to forge those global ties than to give promising students predictable and attractive changes to visit and study in Japan in future years.

2021-12-16,"OPINION: COVID-19 and new ""broken dialogue"" with Japan",,"It's unimaginable that more than two years into the pandemic with more than 15 million people killed, World Trade Organization (WTO) countries are still stuck debating whether WTO intellectual property barriers should be waived for COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and tests.
Actually, that's not quite correct: The needed waiver has been scotched thanks to a few wealthy countries doing Big Pharma's bidding.
Instead, the WTO staff is pushing for a deal on a rump text that experts at Doctors Without Borders and other groups conclude​ is unlikely to result in more vaccines being made or administered. It does not even apply to treatments and tests. Worse, it could undermine countries' existing WTO flexibilities to make generic versions of medicines.
This is not what most countries want. More than 100 support a temporary waiver of the WTO's monopoly rights for pharmaceutical corporations so that more of the most effective mRNA vaccines and life-saving treatments, like Paxlovid, can be produced in as many locations as possible.
President Joe Biden supported a WTO waiver of IP barriers for COVID vaccines. South Africa and India's text that waives WTO's Agreement on Trade-Related Intellectual Property (TRIPS) provisions has 65 country cosponsors.
Yet with our health and the world economy at risk from dangerously low vaccination rates and limited access to treatments in most developing nations, three WTO members—the European Union (EU), Switzerland and the U.K.—have blocked the rest of the world.
At the start of 2022, the WTO's director general sought a way forward through talks among the EU, South Africa, India and the U.S. But that process failed as the EU defended the pharmaceutical industry position and refused to waive intellectual property monopolies while the U.S. insisted that any deal cover only vaccines not easier-to-produce treatments. The U.S. demand seems particularly ironic, cruel and out of step with the ever-changing COVID-19 situation, now that U.S. COVID strategy has changed to prioritize testing and treatment.
That text was so bad only the EU supported it. It was resoundingly rejected worldwide. WTO rules have limited countries' freedom to operate generic COVID-19 medicine production, thus the need for a waiver, not additional constraints.
But now, remarkably, even though South Africa, India and the U.S. did not support the EU's no-waiver approach and most WTO countries support a waiver, the rump text has replaced the waiver as the focus of WTO negotiations.
Partners In Health, Oxfam and other groups urged Bidento reject this approach that wouldn't deliver even on his limited vaccine waiver pledge.
Waiving IP barriers is as relevant as ever. What is described as a ""glut"" in developing nations is widely understood there as pharmaceutical corporations and wealthy countries dumping old and less effective vaccines that their citizens don't want. If second generation versions of the most effect mRNA shots targeted to stop infection by recent variants like Omicron are only available in a few wealthy nations and mass outbreaks continue in the developing world, we will lose the next race between vaccines and variants.
What is needed is simple—a straightforward waiver, eliminating legal uncertainties, not raising new issues, so that any firm producing any of these badly needed vaccines, treatments and tests does not have to worry about being sued.
The principle of access to intellectual property in the face of an epidemic has long been accepted. It's just that the drug companies are engaged (successfully) in foot dragging to maximize profits before more supplies eventually become available.
It's horribly reminiscent of what happened in the 1990s HIV/AIDS epidemic. Millions of people in Africa suffered and died from AIDs while a few powerful developed countries blocked a WTO waiver for life-saving antiretrovirals.
Instead of focusing on saving lives, today in the lead up to the WTO's major decision-making June 12 ministerial conference meeting, trade negotiators are being put under enormous pressure to ink an agreement, any agreement, to show that the WTO is still relevant.
No agreement is better than a bad agreement. Negotiators still have time to fix the situation. If the EU, U.K., Switzerland and the U.S. won't agree, at a minimum they must commit to not attacking countries that act to save their citizens as developing countries and emerging markets must take the protection of their citizens in their own hands, doing whatever they can.
We should also recognize the anger felt in the developing countries over what has happened. It is part of the reason that many countries are not lending support to European and American defense of Ukraine against Russia's outrageous attack. We seem to care about the lives of Ukrainians, but not those dying unnecessarily of COVID-19.
There is no need for more people to die, for more mutations—some more deadly and contagious—to arise or for more to fall into poverty as more livelihoods are destroyed. The upcoming WTO ministerial summit could save lives and livelihoods, rehabilitate the international rules-based system and make an important step for international solidarity by enacting a clean waiver for COVID-19 vaccines, treatments and tests.
What is at stake is not just this pandemic, but the next. Will the WTO and intellectual property monopolies over medicines again impede the global response, again causing unnecessary deaths, again exacerbating an economic downturn?
The ball is the hands of a few countries—the EU plus the U.K., Switzerland and the U.S.—who ironically hold themselves out as stalwarts of human rights. But what human right is more important that the right to live?

2022-06-10,WTO Cannot Continue as Barrier to COVID-19 Medicines | Opinion,,"Draconian lockdowns have been followed by an abrupt change of course in China. Once again, the Communist Party has failed the people.
For the last three years, the Chinese people have endured sweeping COVID-19 restrictions. One hundred-day lockdowns were not uncommon. That's 100 days confined to an apartment, eating from plastic trays of food delivered to the door, and no physical contact with others outside the household.
Barricaded apartment blocks looked like scenes from a doomsday film. Anonymous figures in white protective suits enforced constant testing, and a single positive result could send thousands into quarantine. In some cases, even the pets of those who tested positive were killed. Young children were separated from their parents for days, ending up in gigantic halls where the system segregated the infected.
Safety through fear
Authorities justified the massive restrictions by pointing to the deadly danger posed by the virus. Unlike the supposedly decadent Western nations, the United States in particular, the regime implied that it actually cared about its citizens and could guarantee their safety. The strict zero-COVID policies were essential to preventing millions of deaths, it was said.
Early in the pandemic there was also talk in Germany about the best ways to combat the virus. There were advocates of a strict zero-COVID policy here, too. But by the time the Omicron variant arrived at the end of 2021, it was clear that such a policy would only delay the inevitable.
China's communist neighbor Vietnam, which had until then also pursued a zero-COVID policy, changed its policies to rely on vaccinations, and a wave of infections overtook the entire country. But today life in Vietnam is largely as it was before the pandemic.
Ideology over practicality
This is when China took its own unique path. With each passing month, the country moved closer to an impasse. The regime's actions were no longer primarily about fighting the pandemic, but about ideological goals: China wanted to prove the superiority of its own system above the rest of the world.
In the run-up to the 20th Party Congress of the Communist Party this October, at which President and party leader Xi Jinping, the father of the zero-COVID policy, was to be made ruler for life, no disturbance was tolerated.
Escapes and protests
The extent to which people had suffered under the Communist Party's coercive safety measures became clear when thousands of workers fled Foxconn's production halls as soon as a positive case was reported in November. They hoped to escape weeks or even months of isolation.
Then protests erupted in various cities after the party congress. Given the omnipresent surveillance and repression protesters would face, their participation showed how many had reached the limits of what they could tolerate.
The protests were quickly diffused. At no point did they threaten the system. More threatening may have been the growing reluctance of foreign investors to invest in China, however. A growing number of international companies have publicly flirted recently with the idea of withdrawing from business in China because of the harsh lockdown measures.
A radical change of course
What remains surprising and incomprehensible is how the Chinese state, which prides itself on its technocratic administration, has reacted. Virtually overnight, the COVID restrictions were lifted and the testing regimen was abolished - shifting the policies from one extreme to another.
If the Communist Party had ever cared about the safety of its citizens, it would have fostered a transitional period, initiated a comprehensive vaccination campaign, and strengthened the health care system. But none of that happened.
The most recent vaccination for many old and sick people, who in any case were only vaccinated with the less effective Sinovac agent, took place months ago. Pharmacies and hospitals are now completely overrun. The virus doesn't make exceptions. And experience gives rise to the fear that millions will become infected and tens of thousands could die.
Once forced into isolation by the regime, the Chinese people are now being left alone once again.

2022-12-19,China: Opinion: China's COVID-19 policy has failed,,"The following information was released by the United States Army:
BY Jim Garamone , DOD News
Two Navy hospital ships deployed to New York and Los Angeles to aid in fighting the pandemic are winding down operations, Jonathan Rath Hoffman, assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs, said today.
The USNS Comfort left New York harbor for its home port in Norfolk today. The USNS Mercy in Los Angeles has stopped accepting new patients.
""These are both welcome signs that the American public is following CDC guidelines and the number of COVID-19 cases are decreasing,"" Hoffman said. ""Local hospital capacity in these two areas have been sufficient to meet the demand.""
This does not mean that DOD personnel are out of the fight against coronavirus, though. In New York the hardest hit area in the country there are almost 700 uniformed doctors and nurses deployed in hospitals in the city and surrounding areas, Hoffman said.
But the DOD has worldwide missions, responsibilities and interests, and the Pentagon spokesman highlighted some of them.
He announced that British Royal Navy Commodore James Parkin turned over command of the International Maritime Security Construct in Manama, Bahrain to British Royal Navy Commodore Rob Bellfield in a virtual ceremony. The construct is meant to secure the vitally important Arabian Gulf region from malign actions. A total of eight nations participate in the construct and Parkin said he expects more to join.
He also noted that yesterday the U.S. Transportation Command awarded a $7.2 billion global household goods contract to the American Roll-on, Roll-off Carrier Group of New Jersey. The contract is for relocating service members and their families.
Hoffman also announced that two Navy ships the USS Barry and USS Bunker Hill conducted freedom of navigation operations this week in the South China Sea. The ships ""started and ended a full transit at a time and place of our choosing, as we always do,"" he said. ""The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate to challenge excessive maritime claims in order to preserve the rights, freedoms and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations under international law.""
Finally, he announced that DOD representatives will testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee next week on the Federal Communications Commission decision to award Ligado Networks to deploy a 5G system that could disrupt the Global Positioning System. Dana Deasy, DOD's chief information officer; Michael Griffin, undersecretary of defense for research and engineering; and Space Force Gen. John Raymond, the chief of space operations and commander of U.S. Space Command, will testify before the panel.","NAVIES (91%); ARMIES (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); US ARMY (90%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (79%); ADMIRALTY LAW (78%); ARMED FORCES (78%); DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS (78%); MARINE SHIPPING (78%); MARINE TRANSPORTATION SAFETY (78%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (77%); OUTPUT & DEMAND (77%); DEFENSE & MILITARY POLICY (73%); MILITARY DEPENDENTS (73%); NURSES & NURSING (73%); PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS (73%); CORONAVIRUSES (72%); FREEDOM OF THE SEAS (71%); VIRUSES (70%); INTERNATIONAL LAW (66%); GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (62%); EXECUTIVES (60%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENTS (60%); ENERGY & UTILITY LAW (50%)

2020-05-01,"DOD SPOKESMAN BRIEFS ON COVID-19 OPS, BAHRAIN COMMAND, 5G PROBLEMS",,"Humanity is facing a crisis unlike any in recent memory. The virus is pernicious, it is insidious, and it is deadly. The uncertainty surrounding the pandemic- how long it will last and how severe it will ultimately be- only makes things worse. But there are some certainties, some things that we can expect and predict and prepare for. After COVID-19, we will most likely witness a surge of mental and behavioral health cases, including substance abuse and addiction problems, that will dwarf the opioid crisis and strain communities throughout the nation.
How can we predict this? Immediately following the Great Recession, suicides rose by 13%, and were attributed to skyrocketing unemployment1. Over the past four weeks, more than 26 million Americans have filed for unemployment, the highest number of claims in U.S. history. To put this in context, this is significantly larger than the entire population of the state of New York, which is currently 19.45 million. Anxiety, loneliness, personal loss, job loss, financial ruin and an uncertain future are often precursors to both mental illness and substance abuse. The virus is creating the perfect storm for an already vulnerable demographic; the current economic shutdown posits the very real possibility of an unprecedented rise in ""death by despair.""
We are already seeing signs of the increasing mental health burden individuals are feeling across the country. The Department of Health and Human Services reported an 891% increase in calls to the Substance Abuse & Mental Health Services Administration's (SAMSHA) crisis hotline between March 2019 and March 2020, with a 338% increase from February to March 20202 alone. Legal sales of alcohol and marijuana in March 2020 have skyrocketed.
Those of us working in the addiction space must recognize the strengths of all types of treatment and recovery programs, including the strengths of the faith-based community. In addition to that, we must look for new was to reach those in need. According to research by Haiden Huskamp3, only a small proportion of people with a substance use disorder (SUD) receive treatment. The shortage of SUD treatment providers, particularly in rural areas, is an important driver of this treatment gap.
Telemedicine could be a means of expanding access to treatment. By implementing evidence-based long-term solutions to these problems, utilizing better technology that will take ""virtual care"" to the next level, and using both predictive and prescriptive technologies to leverage artificial intelligence, telemedicine, deep learning and precision treatment, we can increase recovery capabilities. Now is when addiction service providers need to figure out how to put hope truly within reach of those who need it most.
It is every provider's responsibility- regardless of approach or affiliation- to both recognize and address the underlying issues with which every person suffering from addiction struggles with- questions of identity, worth, value, and purpose. Our centers and their successes suggest that faith should be embraced as another critical component of care if we are truly interested in fostering life-long recovery and personal resilience.
Working with those struggling to overcome addiction requires compassion, patience, empathy, and determination. In the era after COVID-19, how we choose to care for those struggling with mental health and substance abuse dependency will determine how many lives we save, how quickly we recover, and how future generations will define us.
*Gary Blackard is currently the President and CEO for Adult & Teen Challenge USA, a faith-based addiction recovery organization located in Ozark, Missouri.

2020-04-29,COVID-19 Reshapes Opinions On Key Issues,,"Had we known that such a time like this would come, perhaps we may have done better as a country. Perhaps we would have done more for our health and education sectors especially. The fear of contracting the dreaded virus is real and frightening but more worrisome is the fear that our healthcare system may fail us.
At a recent webinar, the audience was asked to answer this question: ""What are the lessons to be learnt for nations following the outbreak of COVID-19?"" This question forced me to think deeply about this virus from a non-personal angle.
At the initial stage of the new coronavirus pandemic, my house-help and I were a tag team. She agreed with me that we had to observe and adhere to all the protocols advised by the World Health Organisation (WHO) and the Federal Government. She would often go overboard and use sanitisers on every single thing coming into our home. Unfortunately, with many months passed and no respite in sight, she is now fed up. With the publicity that ensues from recent COVID-19-related deaths, she now insists that the pandemic affects only the rich and is God-sent to rid Nigeria of those who are the country's problem. From being a convert months ago, she has now become an unbeliever!
Indeed, my help is not the only COVID-19 doubter.
Driving through the streets of Lagos, penultimate week, one could see clear evidence of quite a number of residents openly flouting the WHO COVID-19 precautions. Especially in public buses, it seemed as if it was business as usual. Street traders did not have masks on and even those who did, wore it on the chin. One could see groups of people sitting awfully close to each other without observing social distancing rules.
I guess for some, it is better to be out there earning a living, rather than staying indoors and dying of hunger or allowing poverty in through the door. Yet again, knowing our reliance on local remedies and the trado-herbalist, it is possible that some may believe that local remedies could save them. That could explain why I saw an unusually large number of street hawkers peddling a riot of concoctions: ogogoro, dogonyaro, agbo, etc.
What really would it take to focus on and fix education? If we fixed education, we would have many problem-solvers. To help us solve healthcare issues. To solve drainage and drought issues. We would have engineers to solve our transportation and road issues. To solve many of our problems.
Of course, seeing these persons, it is easy to condemn them for not observing the precautionary measures. But the truth is that these measures are easy to abide by when there are near- to medium-term support structures in place.
Indeed, we often complain about the many ills of our country, but looking out of my window, it dawned on me that our country is not a people-friendly state in the way one insists that organisations must be people-friendly. The state does not really provide much support for its citizens: poor, old, or vulnerable. Yes, feeding the poor and providing them with bread, cooked food etc. is good. But a structured welfare package is better. People need food, but they want to be able to cook it themselves, they don't want to stand on a queue before they can eat. What about shelter, bills, medicines? People want jobs and they want financial stability.
Reading international journals and listening to mainstream news outlets, we are regaled with tales of financial woes. Businesses going bankrupt, laying off thousands, etc. But the impact in the more civilised jurisdictions on unemployment and poverty is being cushioned by financial bailouts put together by their respective governments. That is what Nigerians also need, otherwise people are going to take their chances against COVID.
Had we known that such a time like this would come, perhaps we may have done better as a country. Perhaps we would have done more for our health and education sectors especially. The fear of contracting the dreaded virus is real and frightening but more worrisome is the fear that our healthcare system may fail us. Especially when one considers the toll that this virus has taken on the health care system of countries like the U.S. and the U.K.
At such a time as this, I bet many would have wished that we were in the era of the likes of Awolowo, Ahmadu Bello, Michael Opara, Dr. Majekodunmi, etc.
... for me, lessons learnt are that a functional education system will get Nigeria out of the quagmire it is in now. We will need to fix education and all our knowledge acquisition centres, from primary all the way to universities.
On Facebook, I joined ""The Nigerian Nostalgia 1960-1980 Group"", where posts focus on our history between 1960-1980. Some of the stories and photographs shared, take one back in time to the period when Nigeria was on the path to greatness. A time when we had progressive and selfless leaders. We once had good schools and universities. Our forefathers and mothers believed in quality education. Some of them gave up their children for a short while to seek quality education abroad and they came back to build the nation. But with our premier universities run down; our polytechnics now merely glorified, washed out secondary schools; institutions critical to our sustainable development now ceremonial entities, all of that sweat has been wasted.
What really would it take to focus on and fix education? If we fixed education, we would have many problem-solvers. To help us solve healthcare issues. To solve drainage and drought issues. We would have engineers to solve our transportation and road issues. To solve many of our problems.
So, for me, lessons learnt are that a functional education system will get Nigeria out of the quagmire it is in now. We will need to fix education and all our knowledge acquisition centres, from primary all the way to universities.
Until we do, I fear that the saviours of Nigeria may not yet be born.

2020-07-14,"Nigeria , Post-COVID-19 [opinion]",,"India, under Prime Minister Narendra Modi's rule, is undergoing a major ideological shift. The country, once glorified as a secular democracy, is now exposing its minorities (Muslims) to suppression. Indian secularism, in the past decade, is strained with hostility against Muslims. Muslims account for more than 14 percent of the country's 1.3 billion population and are in the treacherous state. A series of events, which took place in recent times, reflects the Muslims' agonies in India. In the first place, last year, New Delhi, to change the demographics of Kashmir, deprived it of its special status. In November 2019, the Indian Supreme Court decided the case of Babri Masjid in the favor of Hindus, while ordering allotment of alternative land to Muslims for setting up of a mosque. In the next development, the enforcement of the infamous Citizen Amendment Act (CAA) has tampered with the Muslims' sentiments. Implementation of the CAA sparked nationwide protests in India since it stroked fear of marginalization among Indian Muslims. The string of the following events symbolizes the country's thriving quest to transform it into the Hindu Rashtra.
In recent times, when COVID-19 has overwhelmed the whole world, anti-Muslim sentiments still dominate India. The COVID-19 outbreak has intensified Islamophobic attacks in India, with Muslims being accused of spreading the virus. The Bharatiya Janta Party (BJP) has waged a campaign to defile Muslims by blaming them for the spread of Coronavirus in India. Hate speeches by the Indian Nationals accusing the Tablighi Jamaat of exacerbating the Coronavirus pandemic in India have dispirited the Muslim community in India. The BJP categorically used the virus to target members of the Tablighi Jamaat. Lately, the social media is swamped by calls for social and economic boycotts of Muslims, and they turned the subjects of various physical attacks, amid falsehoods accusing them of spreading the virus deliberately.Hashtagssuch as #CoronaJihad trended for days on Twitter and panelists in TV debates called them ""human bombs"". Following the Jamaat issue, a wave of Islamophobic posts unleashed on social media by right-wing Hindus, some of them employed in Gulf countries. These developments met with strong resentment in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) - the genuine Indian ally - and Kuwait; they condemned anti-Muslim sentiments in India. Princess Hend al-Qassimi, a member of the UAE royal family, warned ""openly racist and discriminatory"" Indians in the Gulf that they ""will be fined and made to leave"" the country.
The following incidents reflect Indian government hatred against Muslims. The BJP since seizing the power in India in 2014 aims to marginalize Indian Muslims. The BJP leaders have repeatedly floated anti-Muslim remarks in their speeches and interviews since their agenda is rooted in the principles of Hindutva. The Hindutva ideology has gained tremendous strength in India under the leadership of Narendra Modi. Over the last six years, the BJP's tenure has been marred by assaults on human rights and religious freedom. Masses linked to the BJP have beaten and injured the scores of Muslims for trading or slaughtering cows. The event of the COVID-19 highlighted further atrocities and heinous BJP intentions designed at Indian Muslims.
The United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF) describes the Hindutva policy as an ideology that ""seeks to make India a Hindu state rested on Hindu values. The BJP appears to exercise and disseminate this ideology ardently. This philosophy serves as a trump card for the BJP to cajole Indian masses. Apart from promoting economy, trade, commerce, and business, the other factor, which is tapped to force people to support the BJP as a singular idea, is Hindutva. The Hindutva ideology stems from the work of Vinayak Damodar Savarkar. Prime Minister Modi exhibits great love and reverence for him (Savarkar). In the eyes of Savarkar Muslims and Christians are foreigners and 'invaders'.He detested Gandhi's philosophyof Hindu-Muslim amity and assumed him as being 'soft' on Muslims and an impediment to his goal of Hindu Rashtra. According to Savarkar's Hindutva dogma, the religious minorities are considered to be the part of India but they will need to owe allegiance to Hindus and accept its superiority. The way Savarkar saw, to become part of the Indian nation, minorities must accept Hindu culture. Unfortunately, in India, Savarkar's doctrine of hatred has superseded Gandhi's ideology of love. Therefore, for the propagation of Hindutva, the BJP has turned blind eye on minorities and focuses on promoting a single identity (Hindu). Such an approach runs counter to the spirit of Secularism. In the past, driven by such despair, Muhammad Ali Jinnah sought to craft a country (Pakistan) for Muslims to practice their religious duties outwardly any anxiety. The contemporary anti-Muslim climate in India validates Jinnah's apprehensions that he had foreseen long ago. Besides, almost 200 million population of Muslims share a fair part of Indian politics, culture, tradition, and norms. Modi and its team are apprehensive of growing Muslim influence in these spheres. The BJP, therefore, is hell-bent upon targeting the Muslim community in India.
Such a miserable state, of Indian Muslims, is a harbinger of more damaging developments to happen. The suppression of Indian Muslims is likely to disturb -already disturbed- Indo-Pak relations. Pakistan has always been voicing its concerns against Indian atrocities on Muslims. Any development against Muslims, all over the world, hurts Pakistan since its ideological foundation is based on Islam. Therefore, similar events in India make peace between both nations elusive. Also, marginalizing a particular sect (Muslims in India) might prompt it to bigotry and intolerance, jeopardizing the regional peace. Related events also bear responsibility for the oozing refugee crisis that burdens immediate neighbors. At a time when the primary focus of the BJP should be on the health and safety of the Indian Nation, the ongoing events in India have unveiled the BJP's obsession against Muslims. The dream of a unified India will materialize only if Modi abandons the approach of making India a Hindu Rashtra state coupled with the Hindutva philosophy.

2020-06-03,Islamophobia In India Amid COVID-19 – OpEd,,"By Emanuel Pastreich*
For all the coverage of heads of state and high-ranking diplomats, the perceptions generated by the media have the greater impact on the course of international relations. The panic over the coronavirus and the profoundly contradictory reports issued to the public by the media without any effort to introduce a scientific analysis have turned a medical challenge that could have been an opportunity to promote global cooperation into a disruption to the global economy that has brought airports to a standstill and sent stock markets crashing.
Moreover, the dominance of the United States as a producer of journalism standards for the world has meant that the nation's greatest weaknesses have become the world's weaknesses. , Decades of deregulation in the United States have produced a radical concentration in media sources under the control of massive corporations and killed off local newspapers and independent stations. Newspapers and magazines have shed staff for decades and requirements for public service in reporting have disappeared. The evisceration of any tradition of government regulation during the Reagan era has spread to virtually the entire world.
It is now accepted opinion in many countries that media is a source of profits not a means of educating the public.
The COVID-19 outbreak and the round-the-clock reporting of its impact have brought the critical power of the media in international relations into focus. The failure of the media to hold President Trump accountable could be seen in the coverage of the president's press conference in which his declaration of a national state of emergency over the coronavirus concealed a push for the comprehensive privatization of medicine in the United States, including a proposal to replace doctors replaced by Internet ""telecare"" and to no longer require hospitals to adhere to regulations for a maximum number of patients.
The implications for human security at home and abroad of this breakdown in the debate on governance are serious. The media is not challenging at all Trump's effort to overturn regulations on medical practice in the name of a national emergency.
But the failure of journalism does not stop there. The constant reporting of every person to die from the disease – while leaving out those who die from gun violence, suicide or many other diseases – is aimed at exciting panic more than to stimulate a rational debate among citizens on policy appropriate to a democracy. There was little reporting on what specific steps the individual can take to keep healthy and protect himself or herself from disease (of which COVID-19 is just one).
For example, the average citizen should not be cowering in fear at home, afraid to go out, but rather building up a strong immune system. That means eating lots of fresh fruit and vegetables, avoiding tobacco and alcohol, getting lots of sleep, and reducing stress in one's life while making sure to get sufficient exercise.
The administration would have made a bigger contribution to health by banning processed foods with high sodium and high sugar contents from convenience stores and fast food chains than cancelling flights to China and whipping up such a fear of the foreign that Asians have been assaulted and Chinese restaurants have been driven out of business. But this irrational policy decision had coldly rational reasons. The companies that sell sugary drinks and sodium-laden processed foods are precisely the clients who support the commercial media. Banning processed foods and providing all citizens access to fresh vegetables and fruits might make sense from the vantage point of science, but not from the perspective of profit.
During this crisis, the media has also turned a blind eye on the ongoing destruction of public medical facilities in the United States and the general privatization of medicine and insurance, all of which have compromised the national response to diseases of all kinds. Also, the critical problem of providing nutrition and healthcare for the homeless and the working poor was passed over in silence.
Rather, the media has replicated the virus's strategy of transmission by passing around the world sensationalist reports, terrifying discussions, and myopic analyses that do not inform the public about the fundamental science of virology. Rather, the media has presented daily updates on the number of cases as if they were the scores of a baseball game.
The constant coverage of coronavirus has pushed other reporting to the margins. The far greater danger of climate change, which is killing millions and will kill far more, has been shortchanged in reporting. So has been the mounting threat of nuclear war as the United States pulls out unilaterally from arms control agreements and spends close to a trillion dollars on the upgrading of nuclear weapons systems. For that matter, the radical concentration of wealth around the world has been virtually ignored by the mainstream media. The decision of the Federal Reserve, without any form of democratic consultation, to inject $1.5 trillion into the stock market was buried under COVID-19 reporting.
Actual scientific reporting on what exactly the coronavirus is and how it functions has been relatively rare. Media is not by nature educational these days, but rather aimed at sensationalism and marketing. Few true experts appear on television to explain the process an outbreak goes through or to provide meaningful comparisons between the number of deaths from COVID-19 and other deadly contagious diseases like tuberculosis, hepatitis B, or pneumonia.
The concern about public gatherings had a real basis in science, but the decision to shut down numerous schools around the world, was unprecedented in history. The long-term risk of leaving citizens isolated and uninformed trumps the short-term risk of possible transmission of a disease.
Many of these policy decisions were made by politicians without consulting experts and often against the advice of the World Health Organization. In the case of the United States, the Trump administration blocked medical experts from meetings concerning COVID-19 policy because they lacked the proper security clearance. In most cases, the decision-making process that lay behind sudden policy shifts, undertaken in many cases without the passage of laws or debate by congressional committees, were not described in the media. The most important issue, the process by which policy is made and implemented, was completely obscured from the public.
In other words, a media devoted to informing the public about matters of life and death is needed now more than ever. Without properly funded investigative journalism and public-interest media, the United States, and with it the world, is flying blind.

2020-03-17,The Global Media And COVID-19 – OpEd,,"May 01, 2021( The People's Vanguard of Davis: http://davisvanguard.org Delivered by Newstex)  (ALTAF QADRI, AP) By Esma Mesihovic I distinctly remember watching my first video of the situation in India: crematoriums overwhelmed by lines of wrapped bodies near bright funeral pyres. They were urgently running out of space. Some time afterward, my Instagram stories became filled with pressing calls for help, images of burning wood next to hashtags about a crumbling healthcare system and lack of oxygen.  I can't shake away the feeling that India's distress call could have been responded to earlier — including by its own government. 
According to NBC News[1], India passed 200,000 COVID-19-related deaths and became the fourth country to do so. A second wave of infections has broken out and hospitals are suffering from a lack of beds and medical oxygen. The hospitals, however, are not the only places that are overcrowded. Crematoriums are also out of space, and some have even resorted to burning the dead on the streets, parks or in parking lots. The images that I described have circulated around the globe on social media and represent the urgency of the crisis well. India also broke a world record for the highest single-day figure of new COVID-19 infections, and overall it has recorded 17.9 million cases. Additionally, experts fear that the real death toll is far higher than the official number that was released, which only adds to the weight of the situation. The international community is treating India's deadly second wave of the coronavirus pandemic as an urgent global crisis which is what I hoped for. However, I don't think that the measures that have already been taken are nearly enough. According to a New York Times article[2], the coronavirus surge is continuing to break records. While I did not expect to see positive results spring up overnight, I still think that this crisis could have been alleviated in the long term. This just shows how unprepared the global community — our world, was for the pandemic. Vaccinations have been concentrated highly in wealthy nations and the U.S. embargo on raw materials for making vaccinations was only recently lifted. Vaccination inequality exists because of the world's overall unpreparedness to face the virus. And if you think I've been watching too much Vox News recently — you are absolutely right. By making bilateral deals with manufacturers of vaccines first, richer countries like the U.S. were given priority. Because the vaccines' availability was not guaranteed until they passed through regulation and reached the market, these countries made multiple investments and deals with manufacturers in case of risk.  That meant that poorer countries were forced to the back of the line for receiving vaccines. In one of the latest YouTube videos released by Vox, Covax, a program co-led by the World Health Organization was discussed as a solution. Through the funds of wealthy countries, Covax could work towards providing equal distribution of vaccines in the world. The U.S. had already announced $4 billion of funding for Covax. However, despite this, Covax has not delivered enough vaccinations to solve India's problem. I didn't expect them to either. After a quiet February when people in India were wondering whether the virus was finally coming to an end, the sharp increase of cases was nearly unpredictable and the people were not equipped to face it. Many had to depend on social media and other means to get help. According to an article by The Atlantic[3], India's finance minister announced an aid package that amounted to less than 1 percent of the country's GDP, which is not sufficient at all. It's safe to say that the government and many people did not make the right choices during that quiet period. At the beginning of 2021, the government of Prime Minister Narendra Modi began to take the virus lightly and allowed pre-pandemic life to resume.  As this article of The Guardian[4] stated, Hindus flocked to observe the Kumbh Mela festival and dip in the Ganges river for religious purposes on multiple days, beginning from January. Crowds were largely unmasked. While I respect faithfulness and adherence to spiritual practices, precautions are a necessity and abrupt turns are dangerous. I firmly believe that if people had continued to safeguard themselves and their families — even if it means modifying religious exercises for the greater good — the resurgence would have been weaker. For a fact, Prime Minister Modi's confidence brought much more harm than benefit, which is why I think the Indian government should take responsibility. With that said, I also want to direct some attention toward the good news. The Biden administration stated that it would share up to 60 million AstraZeneca doses to other countries. In an interview[5] with Google CEO Sundar Pichai, he says that companies with different capabilities should contribute to the giving of 'vaccine production and supply,' and help 'with oxygen concentrators and supplies.' He also asserts that Google is working with the Ministry of Health in India to focus on conveying the right information to people there, which I think is vital for everyone. Other countries have also extended their support, such as the U.K. and Pakistan. But it doesn't stop here. You can help too. Non-profit organizations such as Hope Foundation[6] and other charity groups are seeking donations for the humanitarian crisis. While I believe that India's government did not do enough to protect its people, that precautions had not been taken and that events like this reveal how unprepared the international community is during a pandemic, I also believe that when there are still ways to give a helping hand, there is room for hope too.

By Jim Schnabel
Epidemiological models of COVID-19 that are used to guide policies on social distancing measures should take into account the special dynamics of the coronavirus's spread in nursing homes and other long-term care (LTC) facilities, according to Weill Cornell Medicine researchers.
The researchers, in a commentary published online June 5 in the Journal of the American Medical Association, note that conditions in LTC facilities tend to be highly conducive to the spread of SARS-CoV-2, the coronavirus that causes COVID-19. These facilities have accounted for a vastly disproportionate number of COVID-19 cases, as well as COVID-19 deaths more than 40% of deaths from the disease in the United States overall, while LTC facilities house only a small percentage of the population and more than 80% of COVID-19 deaths in some states.
Despite this, prominent epidemiological models that many national governments have used to guide their COVID-19 policy responses, including social distancing policies, have treated LTC populations as if they are identical to surrounding populations likely with adverse consequences for both, the investigators say.
""This is really a tale of two pandemics a very intense one in long-term care facilities, and a much more varied one in the wider community yet these influential models have failed to distinguish between the two,"" said lead author Karl Pillemer, a professor of gerontology in medicine at Weill Cornell Medicine and the Hazel E. Reed Professor in the Department of Human Development, in the College of Human Ecology at Cornell.
As the researchers note in their commentary, the most prominent and influential COVID-19 models work by estimating the numbers of susceptible, exposed, infectious and recovered people in a given population. These models can take into account the way that major factors such as age alter the risks faced by virus-exposed people for example, the risk of developing serious COVID-19 illness that requires hospitalization, or of dying from that illness. They may also break down a national population into different state or provincial populations to model the effects of local disease-control policies.
However, these models have not distinguished between the general population and the uniquely vulnerable population that resides in nursing homes and other LTC facilities. The latter typically are older and relatively immobile, have age-related diseases such as dementia, and are the likeliest to perish when they get COVID-19, with case-fatality rates of 20% or more. Social distancing and isolation measures aren't feasible for most of these individuals, due to their frailty and the density of their living arrangements in which a single infected resident or caregiver may quickly infect everyone else. In this vulnerable, cloistered population, policies aimed at preventing COVID-19 spread in the wider community may have little or no effect, or even an adverse effect.
""In both the United States and the United Kingdom, early model-based projections about the need for vast numbers of hospital beds for the general community were used to support COVID response policies that accelerated discharges of older patients back to their residential facilities in order to create 'surge capacity' paradoxically seeding the very outbreaks among the most medically vulnerable that those planning efforts were intending to prevent,"" said senior author Dr. Nathaniel Hupert, an associate professor of medicine and of population health sciences at Weill Cornell Medicine.
""We need new models to capture the disease spread and mortality characteristics within these long term care facilities,"" said Lakshminarayanan Subramanian, a professor in the Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences at New York University, and an author on the commentary. ""These dynamics fundamentally differ from conventional population-level epidemiology models that have been used for capturing COVID-19 spread across geographies.""
Modeling LTC populations separately from community-living populations would help characterize outbreaks in each, making it easier for policymakers to institute measures appropriate for both populations, including for example the provision of more personal protective equipment to nursing home staff, the authors write. Such steps might save many thousands of lives, and at the same time spare the United States and other countries unnecessary economic damage from measures that are predicated on inaccurate estimates of COVID-19 community spread, the researchers say.
""It's likely that in many states, the lockdowns have been more successful than people realize, and COVID-19 infections in the wider community really have been dropping, even as infections continue more or less unabated in nursing homes,"" Pillemer said. ""The influential models still cannot capture that distinction, though and we argue that you can't continue to do public health planning and make policies based on COVID-19 models unless the models do distinguish these two separate pandemics that have very different rules by which they run and require very different interventions.""

2020-06-08,OPINION: COVID-19 MODELS MUST FACTOR IN NURSING HOME SPREAD,,"Diane Coyle is a professor of public policy at the University of Cambridge.
Aristotle was right. Humans have never been atomized individuals, but rather social beings whose every decision affects other people. And now the Covid-19 pandemic is driving home this fundamental point: each of us is morally responsible for the infection risks we pose to others through our own behavior.
In fact, this pandemic is just one of many collective-action problems facing humankind, including climate change, catastrophic biodiversity loss, antimicrobial resistance, nuclear tensions fueled by escalating geopolitical uncertainty, and even potential threats such as a collision with an asteroid.
As the pandemic has demonstrated, however, it is not these existential dangers, but rather everyday economic activities, that reveal the collective, connected character of modern life beneath the individualist façade of rights and contracts.
Those of us in white-collar jobs who are able to work from home and swap sourdough tips are more dependent than we perhaps realized on previously invisible essential workers, such as hospital cleaners and medics, supermarket staff, parcel couriers, and telecoms technicians who maintain our connectivity.
Similarly, manufacturers of new essentials such as face masks and chemical reagents depend on imports from the other side of the world. And many people who are ill, self-isolating, or suddenly unemployed depend on the kindness of neighbors, friends, and strangers to get by.
The sudden stop to economic activity underscores a truth about the modern, interconnected economy: what affects some parts substantially affects the whole. This web of linkages is therefore a vulnerability when disrupted. But it is also a strength, because it shows once again how the division of labor makes everyone better off, exactly as Adam Smith pointed out over two centuries ago.
Today's transformative digital technologies are dramatically increasing such social spillovers, and not only because they underpin sophisticated logistics networks and just-in-time supply chains. The very nature of the digital economy means that each of our individual choices will affect many other people.
Consider the question of data, which has become even more salient today because of the policy debate about whether digital contact-tracing apps can help the economy to emerge from lockdown faster.
This approach will be effective only if a high enough proportion of the population uses the same app and shares the data it gathers. And, as the Ada Lovelace Institute points out in a thoughtful report, that will depend on whether people regard the app as trustworthy and are sure that using it will help them. No app will be effective if people are unwilling to provide ""their"" data to governments rolling out the system. If I decide to withhold information about my movements and contacts, this would adversely affect everyone.
Yet, while much information certainly should remain private, data about individuals is only rarely ""personal,"" in the sense that it is only about them. Indeed, very little data with useful information content concerns a single individual; it is the context - whether population data, location, or the activities of others - that gives it value.
Most commentators recognize that privacy and trust must be balanced with the need to fill the huge gaps in our knowledge about Covid-19. But the balance is tipping toward the latter. In the current circumstances, the collective goal outweighs individual preferences.
But the current emergency is only an acute symptom of increasing interdependence. Underlying it is the steady shift from an economy in which the classical assumptions of diminishing or constant returns to scale hold true to one in which there are increasing returns to scale almost everywhere.
In the conventional framework, adding a unit of input (capital and labor) produces a smaller or (at best) the same increment to output. For an economy based on agriculture and manufacturing, this was a reasonable assumption.
But much of today's economy is characterized by increasing returns, with bigger firms doing ever better. The network effects that drive the growth of digital platforms are one example of this. And because most sectors of the economy have high upfront costs, bigger producers face lower unit costs.
One important source of increasing returns is the extensive experience-based know-how needed in high-value activities such as software design, architecture, and advanced manufacturing. Such returns not only favor incumbents, but also mean that choices by individual producers and consumers have spillover effects on others.
The pervasiveness of increasing returns to scale, and spillovers more generally, has been surprisingly slow to influence policy choices, even though economists have been focusing on the phenomenon for many years now. The Covid-19 pandemic may make it harder to ignore.
Just as a spider's web crumples when a few strands are broken, so the pandemic has highlighted the risks arising from our economic interdependence. And now California and Georgia, Germany and Italy, and China and the United States need each other to recover and rebuild. No one should waste time yearning for an unsustainable fantasy.

By Airman 1st Class Taylor D. Slater, 86th Airlift Wing Public Affairs
Airmen assigned to Air Force Reserve Command from various locations within the United States arrived at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, to assist with coronavirus disease 2019 operations from May 2-3.
The 10th Expeditionary Aeromedical Evacuation Flight received 58 personnel from the 514th, 315th, 439th, 934th, 45th and 36th Aeromedical Evacuation Squadrons assigned to Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey; Joint Base Charleston, South Carolina; Westover Air Reserve Base, Massachusetts; Minneapolis-St. Paul Air Reserve Station, Minnesota; MacDill Air Force Base, Florida and Keesler Air Force Base, Mississippi. These AE technicians are responsible for transporting patients primarily out of the United States Central Command area of responsibility where they will receive treatment at Landstuhl Regional Medical Center.
The personnel will form into groups referred to as Transportation Isolation teams. Each team consists of 16 medical personnel to include three flight nurses, four AE technicians, three critical care air transport team members, two biomedical equipment engineers, an infectious disease specialist, public health tech, logistician, and bioenvironmental engineer. Each performs a critical role in the safe transport of COVID-19 patients.
Members of the Aeromedical Evacuation Operations Team (AEOT) are responsible for managing the launch and recovery of missions to include aircraft configuration and overseeing flight line activities for safe patient loading and unloading. The incoming AEOT consists of an 11-person team comprised of flight nurses, duty controllers, aeromedical evacuation technicians, and medical service corps officers.
As AEOT members we are tasked to provide unparalleled communication, coordination and support to ensure each mission is successful within our reach, said Capt.

2020-05-06,"COVID-19 OPS: AEOT PROVIDES LIFESAVING SUPPORT, TRANSFER TO POSITIVE PATIENTS",,"I will begin by saying that I am not a supporter of Savickis' hockey clubDinamo Rigabecause I don't see it as hockey, but instead a long-term hybrid occupation move by the Kremlin aimed at brainwashing less-educated Latvians about their lost, happy Soviet childhoods: RAF, VEF, or in other words, about the long-lost superpower – the USSR. Despite everything, this would be the lesser of evils, because considering the inability of the KHL to resist spreading Covid-19 among players,Dinamo Rigahas become a sort of a biological weapon for the Kremlin. You see,half of the team has contracted the virus… or has been deliberately infected?
The funniest thing is that after Putin announced the registration of a Covid-19 vaccine and boasted Russia's great success in combating the virus, almost everyone who arrived in Latvia from Russia has been identified as Covid-19 positive. It almost seems like everyone in Russia has been infected with the disease. The proof for this is the fact that almost all KHL teams arriving in Latvia had at least some of the players be infected with the virus.
This brings us to the next question – perhaps there is something wrong with the vaccine? Maybe there even isn't a vaccine, and everyone who signs up for it receives a shot ofNo-Spa? Let's for a moment assume that Russia was indeed the first ""superpower"" to have developed a Covid-19 vaccine, but thanks to whom? I won't believe the Kremlin's endless lies about the developed healthcare system in Russia, especially after theOmsk hospital photographs– the hospital alleged that it had saved the life of Navalny, who was poisoned, even though the hospital ""was unable"" to determine what exactly happened to the poor Putin's critic.
We can put forward several hypotheses. First, Russia was the first to develop a Covid-19 vaccine because the virus is a biological weapon created by Russia that has got out of hand due to carelessness. Russia simply had more time to develop a vaccine. Moreover, according to numerous sources the Covid-19 pandemic didn't begin in China, but in Russia – even before the notorious bat soup in Wuhan, Siberia was hit with several outbreaks of ""pneumonia"". In Belarus too people were suffering from pneumonia already before the Covid-19 outbreak. But after Lukashenko proclaimed himself as the eternal ruler of Belarus, the country officially recognized the existence of Covid-19 because it could be used to officially prohibit people from gathering to protest.
Second – Russia is the first to have developed a Covid-19 vaccine because it has unlimited human resources that can be exploited for medical experiments without them even knowing. There is information that the US is facing certain problems with testing Covid-19 vaccines because laboratories have run out of primates, but mice and rats cannot be effectively used in their place. On the other hand, the Russian Armed Forces have no problem of telling a certain mandatory military service unit, or even an entire army, that they are about to receive a free tick-borne encephalitis or diphtheria vaccine. The same trick can be played out by the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations in entire Siberian villages and no one will ever know that something like this happened. And if someone dies, they will just write ""pneumonia"" or ""influenza"" as the cause of death in their death certificates.
Third, Russia doesn't have a Covid-19 vaccine, but if it does the vaccine is unsafe, ineffective and pointless. It's no secret that people in Russia, especially medical workers, refuse to receive this ""miracle cure"". Even priests and bishops of the Russian Orthodox Church refuse this home-made shot, instead relying on holy water and God's will, even though many of them are infected with Covid-19.
The main conclusion is that Russia stillcannot be trusted at all– all data regarding the number of Covid-19 deaths has been falsified to correspond with the wishes of the Kremlin's master. There is an increasing number of reports about mass graves of Covid-19 victims in Siberia, for instance, inBashkiria. The Kremlin's repressive institutions do all in their power to silence such information in order to hide the true extent of the pandemic. Several media outlets in Ufa, for example, the information agencyBASHINFORM, the media outletsPRO UFU,MCKET,UFA1andGOROBZORhave been reproached and instructed not to write about the virus. I will remind you that in Soviet times Bashkiria was the location of numerous chemical and biological weapons military units, including laboratories, production facilities and warehouses. I doubt that Putin's regime would have ceased the operation of these units.
Many have already forgotten that, when the Covid-19 pandemic was only gathering momentum, the Kremlin kept silent while its propaganda mouthpieces lied in attempts to convince the public that there is no Covid-19 pandemic and that it had been made up by the West in order to increase control and chip every single person. The notorious nightmare factory Sputnik, which has now been forced out of Latvia, even wrote that Covid-19 does not affect Latvians because it was created by a Latvian scientist. Only after people all over the world had contracted the virus the Kremlin began officially reporting the number of Covid-19 cases in Russia.

We live in a world where information is arriving faster than we can process it. This is never more true than in a time of crisis. With the COVID-19 situation changing by the minute across the globe, how do we keep up with what's current information and what's not?
How do we find the truth when the misinformation and miscommunication—however well intentioned—is spreading faster than the virus itself?
If you Google COVID-19, there are already more than five million references, and more than two billion references of #coronavirus in the media. There are conspiracy theories, advice from different levels of government, conflicting medical advice, and opinions flooding in through traditional and social media, and those of us still talking at safe distance around the recently sanitised watercooler.
In the fight to contain the virus, graphic design might seem an unexpected weapon. But graphic design has a long history of helping identify, fight and stop the spread of disease, dating back as far as 1854 when another epidemiological disaster threatened the population—the London cholera outbreak.
Working hand-in-hand with medicine, graphic design—or data visualisation more specifically—changed the course of history. Florence Nightingale is known as the founder of modern nursing, and for improving sanitation in war hospitals. But she was also a pioneer in infographic design.
Publishing her report on war hospitals in 1858, Nightingale worried the statistics she had included seemed dull so she included an infographic that she invented.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); DISINFORMATION & MISINFORMATION (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (76%); PUBLIC HEALTH (76%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (75%); TROPICAL DISEASES (75%); HISTORY (74%); CONSPIRACY THEORY (73%); SOCIAL MEDIA (70%)

2020-03-26,Opinion COVID-19: How graphic design can help save lives,,"Verdict has conducted a poll to assess how healthcare providers should use PPE after the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of the poll results shows that healthcare providers should continue to use PPE at the same frequency as now in all healthcare settings, as voted by 59% of the respondents. The frequency of PPE usage should remain the same post-COVID, but only in the busiest parts of hospitals such as emergency departments, as opined by 17% of the respondents. 
According to 8% of the respondents, PPE should be used at the same frequency as during COVID, but only in certain seasons such as flu season. Further, 10% of the respondents voted that PPE should be used less frequently after COVID, while 6% of the respondents opined that PPE should be used by healthcare providers under other conditions after the pandemic. The analysis is based on 321 responses received from the readers of Hospital Management, a Verdict network site, between 18 January and 02 March. PPE usage during and after the COVID-19 pandemicThe surge in use of PPE during the coronavirus pandemic led to a worldwide shortage of various PPE equipment including protective suits, gowns, gloves, face shields, masks, and goggles. PPE shortage was a major reason behind high rates of infection among healthcare providers in Italy and the US, where healthcare facilities were overwhelmed due to the mounting number of COVID-19 cases. PPE usage is expected to continue post-pandemic with expenditure on PPE projected to triple by 2027, according to the Health Industry Distributors Association. Researchers are, therefore, working towards making PPE equipment more effective, biodegradable, and sustainable. Researchers from the University of Alberta are, for example, developing a fabric treatment for medical gowns and masks that can kill viruses and bacteria upon contact.",,307,Impact News Service

As Brazilian athletes were preparing for the upcoming Summer Olympics, a growing global health crisis shifted the government's attention from winning gold medals to securing testing kits.On February 16th, the Brazilian governmentordered the deployment of220,000 soldiersto hand out educational material to citizens on how to combat the new virus that was ravaging the country, a strategy that proved effective in mitigating the spread of the disease. The year was 2016, andZika viruswas the disease.
Four years later, Brazil is losing the battle against a more formidable enemy, COVID-19. The country has the world's second-highest death toll, having surpassed the United Kingdom as deaths reached44,000. As the situation becomes grimmer by the day, President Jair Bolsonaro has chosen to replace his two previous health ministers with an army general to lead the country to battle, even though he lacks a background in public health or medicine. The president, himself a retired army captain who has fondly romanticized the military dictatorship that ruled Brazil from 1964 to 1985, has downplayed the pandemic, calling it a ""little flu."" Thus far, Brazil's COVID-19 response has been so botched that on May 26, President Donald Trump, long-time Bolsonaro ally,prohibited the entryof foreign Brazilian nationals into the United States due to an increased risk of transmission.
Brazil's rapid response against Zika washailed as a success by the international community, and it highlighted the country's emergence as a global power and pioneer in epidemic response and coordination. However, the country's reaction to COVID-19 has been marred by politicization, sparking friendly fire between politicians and health experts. Unlike the Zika outbreak, where soldiers promoted public health messaging, today's military and security forces usethreats against protesterswho demand swift action and adequate protection for the frontline health care workers acting as human shields against the virus. From the start of the spread of COVID-19, President Bolsonaro has consistently downplayed the effects of the virus, choosing to focus more on the country's economy. His inaction has forced various governors and congressmen tobreak ranks with him, and to try to push for social distancing measures without the support of the federal government. These asynchronous messages and policies have left the Brazilian people confused andangry. The president's laissez-faire attitude has led to a shortage of adequate personal protective equipment, undermining the herculean efforts of frontline workers to save their fellow citizens; the battle against COVID-19 has accordingly seen its fair share of casualties. To date, more than 19,000 medical professionals have been infected and196have died (among the highest in the world) according to the Brazilian Federal Nurses Council, which has called forvarious proteststhroughout the country. President Bolsonaro has evidently lost control over the situation, evidenced by the""statistical coup""he staged on June 5 to prevent publication of Brazil's cumulative pandemic data.
Statesmen around the world have clung towartime metaphorsduring the pandemic, seeking to rally their citizens to adopt strict measures and prepare for the hard times that lie ahead. However, President Bolsonaro seems to have taken the metaphors literally by confirming Army General,Eduardo Pazuello, as the interim heath minister in charge of the pandemic response. Disagreements over the country's strategy have led to the ousting of two health ministers (both physicians).Luiz Mandetta, the country's most popular cabinet member with a76% approval rating, feuded with the president over the promotion of social distancing. In response, on March 16, Bolsonaro sought to undermine his influence by naming Bragga Netto, yet another army general,head of a ""crisis cabinet"" on the basis that the pandemic's impacts were broader than just health. After Mandetta was given the boot,Nelson Teichtook over as the new health minister, where he lasted in office for less than a month. He tried to balance the president's economic concerns with those of public health officials; however, he ended up disagreeing with Bolsonaro over the effectiveness of using chloroquine to treat COVID-19 patients. The president sees in Pazuello someone who will fall in line and follow orders rather than challenge his erroneous strategies. The naming of Pazuello as interim health minister, who has in turn appointed9 top brass military officersto posts within the ministry, has led to increased concerns over the militarization of the health ministry. Unlike the 2016 Zika outbreak, whensoldiers were recruited to follow the lead of public health expertsfor the common good, now the military follows the lead of a power hungry president and his self-serving motivations.
Looking even beyond the COVID-19 response, the Health Ministry's militarization should be seen as part of a greater attempt by Bolsonaro to methodically appoint moremilitary officials to positions of power. By February 2019, he had appointed103 military officersto serve in various civilian posts, as part of his political troop. These military appointments started before Bolsonaro even took office, when he namedHamilton Mourão, an army generalwith more than five decades of military experience, as his running mate. During the forest fires that set large swaths of the Amazon aflame in 2019, the president looked to themilitary for answers. Even when the fires were extinguished, the military remained active incombating deforestation, at the expense of outraged environmental agencies and activists. The president has sought, unsuccessfully, to organize acelebration of the anniversary of the 1964 military coupand pressured the Education Ministry and public schools torevise their curricula on the military dictatorship. Most recently, President Bolsonaro was seen without a mask marching alongside anti-lock down protesters demandingmilitary intervention. Brazil's increasing militarization and spiraling COVID-19 caseload have even led to a rise inanxietyandmilitary surveillancein neighboring countries in attempts to prevent the spread of the virus into their territories. As the public health and economic situation deteriorates, cooler heads must prevail to prevent any unwarranted diplomatic or military skirmishes.
President Bolsonaro currently faces a federalinvestigationand calls forimpeachment, a sign of his increasing isolation and waning support levels from his broader coalition, and this in turn likely fuels his ever-growing reliance on military officials. Continuing to empower the military will neither save him politically nor get the COVID-19 outbreak under control. A June 5th projection from University of Washington's Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) estimates that Brazil's COVID-19 deaths may skyrocket to165,000 by August 4th, overtaking the United States as the country with the most casualties, despite only having two thirds the population. Thus far, it seems that the invisible enemy may emerge victorious, unless Brazil's leadership begins to radically reimagine its strategy and tactics. It can begin by treating the pandemic as the public health issue it is, rather than a romanticized war resulting in needless sacrifice and death.

2020-07-01,Brazil 's Tale Of Two Epidemics: Zika And COVID-19 – OpEd,,"For the latest edition of Two Takes, a series examining opinions on key issues, Dr. Vinay Prasad weighs in on the debate over whether schools should mandate coronavirus vaccines for students ages 12 and up. His commentary comes on the heels of one such move by a major U.S. school district. Prasad is a hematologist-oncologist and associate professor of epidemiology and biostatistics at the University of California-- San Francisco, and author of ""Malignant: How Bad Policy and Bad Evidence Harm People With Cancer.""
The Los Angeles Unified School District has issued a bold  vaccine mandate for its 600,000-plus school kids. All eligible children 12 and up who don't have qualified exemptions must get two doses of the coronavirus shot, and if they don't, they will  no longer be allowed to attend in-person classes. There are many things we can do to improve vaccine uptake and ease vaccine hesitancy, and I am a firm supporter of encouraging and persuading adults to get vaccinated, but forcing kids to get the two-dose vaccine regimen -- and taking away school if they don't comply -- is bad policy. 
[Opinion:Schools Should Mandate COVID-19 Vaccines for Kids]
First, questions remain around giving adolescents two doses of the coronavirus vaccine -- and it largely boils down to the rare risk of myocarditis, in which the heart muscle becomes inflamed. (Most cases of myocarditis appear to occur after dose two.) 
Although the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has permitted giving everyone ages 12 to 15 two doses of Pfizer's mRNA vaccine under an emergency use authorization, some of our peer nations have chosen a different path. While the vaccine is approved for this age group in the United Kingdom, the U.K.'s vaccine advisers initially recommended against vaccinating healthy kids ages 12 to 15 because the "" marginal"" benefit of vaccinating this age group came at the rare price of myocarditis. (They did, however, advise that kids in this age group with underlying health conditions be vaccinated.) 
A U.K. oversight body has since decided to recommend one dose of the vaccine for healthy kids ages 12 to 15 to prevent disruption to school, but said it was a ""difficult decision"" and should not be seen as a ""silver bullet."" According to Reuters, ""second doses would not be offered to the age group until at least spring as they wait for more data from around the world."" Norway has taken a similar stance and only offers one dose, for now, to kids 12 to 15 (though Canada and other nations follow the two-dose regimen like the U.S.). 
In an effort to minimize the risk of myocarditis -- and help young people build stronger immunity against COVID-19 -- Norway also advises spacing out the doses for kids 16 to 17 anywhere from  eight to 12 weeks, versus the U.S. standard of three weeks. Notably, LA's mandate is written in such a way that many kids can allow no more than four weeks between the first and second dose in order to comply. 
Scott Gottlieb, a former FDA commissioner and current Pfizer board member, argues that parents should have some say in the matter. Recently on CBS' ""Face the Nation,"" Gottlieb noted that parents should have ""some latitude"" on how to vaccinate kids. He also explained that this is not a ""binary decision:"" Parents could opt for their kids to get one dose for now, or one dose for kids who have recovered from COVID-19. Above all, it's a decision that should be personalized and made in lockstep with a pediatrician. I support Gottlieb's position, and advise all parents to discuss vaccinating their child (ages 12 and up) with a physician they trust. 
And in the case of the Los Angeles school district mandate, the punishment does not fit the crime. Taking kids who decline vaccination and preventing them from getting an in-person education is a draconian penalty. The Los Angeles school district, the second largest in the U.S., has already failed children by closing in-person schools for months on end, a move taken by schools around the nation throughout the pandemic. With this new vaccine mandate, LA is poised to push some kids -- those who don't comply or whose parents don't permit them to comply -- out of school for even longer. 
Prolonged school closures have  massive negative effects on children, robbing them of education, the last tattered rung left in the ladder of American opportunity. Diminished education can impact career attainment, happiness, marriage and net worth, which itself is a powerful determinant of crime, poverty and longevity. This stick is too sharp. 
Children who choose not to be vaccinated may not be allowed to make the choice for themselves. For many, it is made by parents who are subject to a constant deluge of misinformation. Decades of policies that have furthered income inequality and political polarization set the stage for vaccine hesitancy, which can vary by wealth and race. Instead of treating the root problems -- wealth inequality, political polarization, tribalism -- we further perpetuate inequality by depriving these children of in-person learning. We cannot punish a child for the sins of the parent, and we cannot punish a child for a parent who is the byproduct of a society that is fractured and impaired. 
Some argue that mandating the coronavirus vaccine is the same as requiring other childhood vaccinations to attend school. In my view, it isn't. There is more uncertainty around its benefits and harms at school age and could factor into why some peer nations are making different policy choices. And, this decision comes after nearly a year without in-person schooling, making the punishment even worse. 
LA is making a bold public statement, and the move will be cheered by many. Other school districts may even take similar steps. But the reality is they are overstepping the certainty of the science, and they are taking out our collective rage and frustration -- that this pandemic has not yet ended -- on children. It is a shameful policy, and I condemn it.

2021-09-28,"Opinion: COVID-19 Vaccines Are Good, but Shouldn't Be Mandated for School Kids",,"Africa is hard hit by the Covid-19 crisis and especially vulnerable to the effects of climate change. A new report suggests ways the continent can build back better as it recovers.
An ambitious plan to ensure stimulus spending in Africa is used to 'build back better' after Covid-19 has been unveiled. Backed by 54 African leaders and championed by President Ali Bongo Ondimba of Gabon, the recommendations were issued by the Global Center on Adaptation and African Adaptation initiative.
With Africa particularly vulnerable to the effects of climate change, the policy recommendations aim to focus stimulus investment on resilient infrastructure and food and water security to overcome the twin covid-climate crisis. The objective is to achieve a triple dividend for African countries by reducing pandemic risk, while at the same time increasing climate resilience and strengthening economic recovery.
The actions cover three key systems affected by both the pandemic and climate change: food production, water management and infrastructure.
""If the virus is a shared global challenge, so too should be the need to build resilience against future shocks,"" says Ban Ki-moon, 8th United Nations Secretary General and Co-Chair of the Global Center on Adaptation. ""Emerging and developing countries are the least prepared for the arrival of Covid-19, just as they are most vulnerable to the effects of climate change.""A Guest Editorial
Today 74% of Africa's population is deemed food insecure, and COVID-19 will make matters worse. To feed their rapidly increasing populations, sub-Saharan African countries already have to rely on massive food imports. Even before the pandemic, these were projected to grow from $35bn in 2017 to $110 billion by 2030. The upshot: Covid-19 could create a severe food security crisis in Africa. Nevertheless, policies that encourage female smallholder farmers and digital technology are among the options that can hA Guest Editorialelp mitigate the situation.
More 320 million people are without access to safely managed drinking water in Africa, and over half the population are without access to any sanitation. And this at a time when we are all being encouraged to wash our hands frequently to prevent the spread of Covid-19. A priority therefore is to boost access to water and sanitation in parallel with efforts to improve water governance across the continent. This requires measures to promote investment that encompass management of 'natural infrastructure' and support effective distribution of scarce water resources for multiple uses.
To sustain Africa's growth, and speed up efforts to end extreme poverty, investment in resilient infrastructure is fundamental. The COVID-19 pandemic has amplified calls for infrastructure to be resilient and adaptable so that it can effectively operate during moments of crisis. According to the World Bank, Africa needs about $100 billion a year for the next decade to fill its infrastructure gap. Economically, there is a strong case for modern, resilient and sustainable infrastructure, with EU research suggesting a $4 return on every $1 invested.

2021-07-22,Is a Green Recovery in Africa Possible After Covid-19? [opinion],,"Iran has been hit very hard by COVID-19. Despite the extensive coverup of fatalities from the deadly virus, even the regime's health officials have admitted that more than 16,000 Iranians have died across Iran.
The National Council of Resistance of Iran, an opposition group that has accused the regime of lying about the number of deaths since day one says these figures are closer to 78,000.
Iran's handling of the COVID-19 crisis is marred by severe mismanagement which is derived from the regime's alarming disregard for the lives lost to the virus. Most recently, Iran's President Hassan Rouhani said that holding annual mourning ceremonies for Ashura was a ""must"".
Ashura, held in late August, is a Shia mourning ceremony for the grandson of the Prophet who was killed along with his family. Mourners usually march on the streets in large groups beating their chests or gather in cramped mosques. Such a ceremony would be a great breeding ground for COVID-19.
Rouhani's insistence that mourning ceremonies be carried out comes at a time when several health officials have warned that the number of COVID-19 cases and deaths have increased.
Iran's COVID-19 crisis
In comments carried by state-run media, a health official at the Medical Sciences University of Ahvaz, a city in the southwestern province of Khuzestan, said that the province had experienced the ""longest COVID-19 peak"".
Despite this, Seyed Mohammad Alavi did not contradict the government's decision to hold mourning ceremonies and said that since ""sunlight had very good anti-virus effects"", ceremonies must be held during the day and that each person must bring three to five masks along.
According to the head of the Islamic World Science Citation Database (ISC), a citation index established by the Iranian Ministry of Science, Research and Technology, Iran's COVID-19 cases are still on the rise in contrast to other countries.
Health officials criticize Rouhani's decision
Mina Mohrez, a member of Iran's COVID-19 Committee, said that Iran was still in the ""red zone"" in terms of the virus.
The regime color-coded the country into red, yellow, and white zones in April, with red meaning that the region was experiencing an alarming number of infections.
""(Ashura) is in less than one month and we don't know what will happen by then. Being present in a closed-off space even with masks should not be prolonged. Large crowds congregate for mourning in mosques and even a short gathering with masks in such an atmosphere is dangerous,"" the infectious diseases specialist said.
Massoud Mardani, a member of Iran's National Influenza Committee said that any kind of gathering was ""not permissible"" due to the increase in virus cases.
Iran's mismanagement
Tehran announced the first cases of the virus in the country well after it had started spreading in Qom, near Tehran. Large state-organized gatherings for the 41st anniversary of the Islamic Republic of Iran were held while the regime falsely denied that COVID-19 had entered the country. They refused to quarantine Qom to prevent the spread of the virus despite persistent calls by health officials. In short, the regime helped spread the deadly virus.
Officials then implemented quarantine without financially compensating Iranians that were told to stay home. They opened highways and politely asked Iranians not to travel for the Persian New Year. The lockdown was lifted shortly after amid warnings by health officials that it was too soon to lift restrictions.
These measures by the regime has left many wondering whether the regime is intentionally spreading the virus and endangering lives.
The truth is that the regime knows that the only thing standing between its survival and angry Iranians who are tired of the dire state of the economy is the virus. COVID-19 is a blessing for the regime, and it will use that blessing to its full potential. The Iranian regime has adopted a strategy of ""mass casualties"" to divert attention from protests, the likes of which almost toppled the theocracy in 2019. But this strategy is temporary and in the long run, will only embolden an already outraged population.

2020-07-30,Iran 's Mishandling Of COVID-19 Pandemic – OpEd,,"Sri Lanka, Dec. 16 -- By Bilesha Weeraratne:
Sri Lanka's migrant workers are an integral part of our economy, with their remittances traditionally accounting for the second largest share of the country's foreign exchange earnings (8% of GDP in 2019) after merchandise exports. After the COVID-19 outbreak and resultant difficulties, a sizeable proportion of migrants looked forward to a safe return home. This blog, written to mark International Migrants Day, examines the experience and challenges in the repatriation process and offers suggestions on the way forward.
The Repatriation Challenge
Sri Lanka has found the process of repatriating vast numbers of Sri Lankans abroad since the closure of international airports for inward travel hugely challenging. The government coordinated large-scale repatriation missions to bring home different categories of migrants - such as students, pilgrims and workers - including those undocumented. By mid-October 2020, after bringing home over 54,000 citizens, at least another 43,000 migrants remain to be repatriated. Compared to the total of 4,992 and 1,179 repatriations handled in 2017 and 2018 respectively, the current scale of repatriations is challenging the capacity of the relevant authorities.
High Air Travel Costs
The first COVID-19-induced repatriation was the return of 33 Sri Lankan students from Wuhan, China in February 2020. This initial repatriation was at state expense. Similarly, the repatriation of beneficiaries under the Kuwait Amnesty was facilitated by the Kuwaiti and Sri Lankan governments. Most other repatriation missions involved a payment by the returnee. The cost of paid air travel under repatriation is criticised as too high. For instance, the (one-way) air-ticket cost in a repatriation flight from India in April 2020 was LKR 58,650 as opposed to a normal air travel cost of approximately LKR 25,074. The cost of an air-ticket from Chicago in June 2020 was approximately LKR 520,430, and from Dubai in July 2020 was approximately LKR 81,000. A repatriation flight from Kuwait in August showed that infants also had to pay the full adult fare. For many Sri Lankan migrants seeking repatriation, such fees are unaffordable.
Nevertheless, such high fees are defended based on cost factors including having to charter flights, fly empty flights on the way to pick Sri Lankans, airports not being fully operational, and the absence of service contracts leading to higher fees for landing, parking, and ground handling, etc. Moreover, the special COVID-19 airline operational procedures and operating below capacity contribute to higher per passenger cost.
Identifying Migrants for Repatriation
With the prolonged closure of entry points, the number of Sri Lankans wanting repatriation kept rising. Despite high demand, the timing of repatriation had to be a function of capacity to provide medical and quarantine facilities, due to the trade off in allocating spots between those already here and returnees. As such, repatriation efforts were stalled on many instances, such as in end-May due to the high rate of infection among returnees under the Kuwait Amnesty, in July due to the expansion of the Kandakadu drug rehabilitation centre cluster, and in October due to the emergence of Minuwangoda and Peliyagoda clusters.
Similarly, the government adopted a ""rotational selection of destinations for repatriation - with high risk as well as low risk destinations interspersed"" to minimise the threat of infections among repatriated. Within countries identified for repatriation, migrants were selected based on need and vulnerability such as undocumented workers, newly unemployed, and those deprived of salaries.
Role of the Private Sector
The combination of capacity constraints, excess demand and willingness to pay gradually has created a market for repatriation. The result was a fee-based repatriation package for travel and quarantine. While state-sponsored quarantine facilities were available, the paid option for quarantine was a minimum of LKR 7500 per day for the 14 days in a hotel including hotel transfer and two PCR tests. Both types of quarantine services are under government supervision, while the latter provides more amenities.
In August 2020, the paid full package repatriation from Kuwait in twin-shared occupancy was approximately LKR 250,000, while the cost from Saudi Arabia was LKR 220,000. However, the cheaper (sharing) option among paid quarantine involves the risk of extra 14 days of paid quarantine, should the other shared guest test positive for COVID-19. As such, the popular choices were single occupancy paid quarantine and state-sponsored free quarantine. Along with hotels offering paid quarantine facilities, private entities became involved in coordinating repatriation.
Similarly, proposals were submitted for the full package of travel and quarantine, i.e. transportation and two weeks quarantine aboard a ship. Now, amidst lobbying by medical stakeholders for private sector medical care for COVID-19 patients, the future repatriation packages are likely to include the choice of paid or state sponsored treatment should the migrant test positive for COVID-19.
Confusion and Corruption
With paid repatriation services, related scams emerged where prioritised services were offered for a premium price or to facilitate entry permission to Sri Lanka.Similarly, there has been confusion about repatriation information. For example, as revealed during interviews for this blog, one returnee from Dubai in July had misunderstood the per day fee and as the total fee and was unable to pay for quarantine facilities received in a hotel in Galle. Moreover, a group of migrants who were repatriated on December 3, 2020 had started the journey by stating their intention to undergo paid quarantine, but upon arriving insisted on state-sponsored quarantine. Amidst allegations of corruption, (E.g. embassy officials in UAE are alleged to have received between LKR 50,500-100,000 to ensure a seat on immediate flights), if this change of heart of returnees upon arrival was not a genuine confusion, it raises the question if opting for paid quarantine is an express channel for repatriation?
Way Forward
The stepping in of the private sector is timely to ease the government's burden, and saves capacity in state-sponsored quarantine facilities. Similarly, the anticipated reopening of Sri Lankan borders for inward travel would reduce the stock of Sri Lankan migrants on the repatriation list, and would make room for those unable to afford paid return. In the interim, a more inclusive, affordable and transparent approach is needed to minimise the financial and emotional cost to Sri Lankan migrants awaiting repatriation. Some strategies are:
Make cost structure for repatriation airfares transparent
Explore ways to reduce airfare costs
Make the repatriation selection process transparent
Maintain two separate lists for those who can and cannot afford repatriation and quarantine, and ensure migrants from both lists are considered for repatriation.

2020-12-16,Opinion: COVID-19 and Migrant Workers: The Economics of Repatriation,,"COVID-19 has wrapped the whole world in its trap because of multiple reasons in which irresponsible behaviour at the hands of states remains at the top. There were some nations such as Italy and America which were not taking the threat of coronavirus serious resultantly both the countries are now the most affected nations of the world.
Even at the extent that the president of America Donald Trump was showing passive behaviour concerning the outbreak of devastating virus resultantly the US has surpassed China and reached the top by highest patients in the world which have crossed two lacs including almost five thousand deaths.
In this regard, President Trump has signed the $2 trillion Coronavirus relief bill. Besides, other nations such as Italy, Spain, China, Germany, France, and Iran come respectively after the US about the patients of COVID-19. As for as Pakistan is concerned, Prime Minister Imran Khan also urged for the international as well as national cooperation to control and eliminate the threat of COVID-19.
While people in Pakistan are not still taking it seriously or fully cooperating with government via looking over their immature and unserious behaviour concerning the restrictions imposed by the government through violating them. In this regard, the government has sealed various shops and other public places that were open even after lockdown. Therefore the government has taken serious steps through lodging FIR against them. Besides, various madrassas/masjids were also offering Friday congregation prayers via side-lining the guidelines given by the government therefore many people were arrested and put behind the bars by security forces of the country. While looking over the staggering and worsening condition of Pakistan which shows a fast increase in the patients of coronavirus government requires the seriousness and cooperation of people to control over fatal disease otherwise it will wipe out most of the population of the country.
Consequently, it is not only the responsibility of people within states to cooperate with the government to defeat first this global pandemic disease but it is also high time for states to cooperate even having multiple differences over numerous issues.
In this regard, for defeating Coronavirus states require global cooperation via setting their enmities and differences aside for the common good. Besides, China continues international cooperation to beat COVID-19. Beijing is determined to cooperate and help other nations, therefore, it has sent aid towards 18 countries over the past month in which it has sent its team as well as tons of medical supply to various countries such as Italy, Cambodia, Pakistan, and United Kingdom.
Along with this Chinese government said that those countries which are not provided aid by it were helping them through an online website. Via looking over the commitment and relentless struggle of the Chinese government as well as people particularly medical staff, they have become successful in controlling the spread of COVID-19. In the same manner, China also emphasized the global stakeholders that global cooperation is the only way to beat the coronavirus. The governments need acts with speed, scale and clear-minded determination to conquer the fast-spreading virus. Because ""viruses do not respect border: neither do they distinguish between races or nations, therefore, responsible governments worldwide should stand firmly against hatred and racism and join hands to promote disease prevention and clinical treatment as well as vaccine development"".
World Health Organisation (WHO) Chief in his recent media briefing said that ""This is not just a threat for individual people or individual countries. We are all in this together, and we can only save lives together"". Though preventive measures suggested by the countries which have minimized and controlled the fast spread of COVID-19 such as China, South Korea, and Sudan are social distancing, contact tracing, widespread testing, and early preparation.
In the DW documentary, Dr. Alexander Edward, an Immunologist, emphasized on the usage of face masks, he also entertained that the world is running out of face mask because of its massive usage. Besides, Nature is a weekly international journal that published an article on March 9 in which emphasized over three things to eliminate coronavirus namely follow WHO advice, end secrecy in decision-making and cooperate globally which is the only way to defeat one of the worst infectious-diseases spread throughout the world. COVID-19 has left severe effects on the social, political, economic, and financial structures of the world. So, it is very difficult only for the governments of states to control and defeat this pandemic virus.
In this regard, governments need the seriousness of behaviour as well as the cooperation of each section of society may it be doctor, social workers, government and private employs, common people, armed forces, businessmen, farmers along with each person who can contribute in any way to help the government to defeat the Coronavirus. This is the easiest and fast way to fight against coronavirus otherwise whole nations including governments are going to bear the brunt of this one of the most dangerous viruses of the 21st Century.

2020-04-02,World Governments Need Cooperation Of Every Section Of Society To Defeat COVID-19 – OpEd,,"A recent poll finds that only 14% of African Americans and 24% of Hispanics trust that a COVID-19 vaccination will be safe and effective.
The remainder, who constitute more than 20% of the U.S. population, harbor uncertainty or distrust about the shots. Many other Americans share the same doubts, a dangerous situation as the new vaccines represent our clearest path out of the deadly pandemic.
Anti-vaccination activists also have tried to spread misinformation through social media.
To counter these misgivings, the Ad Council has partnered with an organization of universities, philanthropies and government agencies known as the COVID Collaborative to raise $50 million for a public education campaign -- one of the largest on record -- aimed at overcoming fears and doubts about COVID-19 vaccination.
Distrust of the vaccines also must be addressed by their makers and the Food and Drug Administration, which needs to be completely transparent with the data from the drug trials. That way, medical professionals can reassure themselves that no corners were cut during the rapid development process, and they can learn exactly what the expected efficacy and side effects will be for each vaccine.
To stop the spread of COVID-19 by vaccination, epidemiologists say a vaccine should be taken by 80% of the population. With some polls indicating that more than half of the population is doubtful that a vaccine will be safe and effective, that goal is going to be out of reach unless the Ad Council and related efforts are successful in changing minds.
That will not be easy. There is a natural tendency in the black community, with good historical reasons, to distrust authority. As University of London researcher Rob Brotherton, author of ""Suspicious Minds,"" has said: ""Given that most conspiracy theories allege that authorities and institutions like the government or the medical establishment are not to be trusted, it is entirely understandable that such theories resonate among communities with long histories of being marginalized and mistreated by those very institutions.""
It will not be enough to have a few prominent African Americans, such as professional athletes, do public service ads. There also must be outreach to trusted figures in each black community, such as ministers and elected officials. U.S. Rep. Jim Clyburn, D-S.C., would be a natural leader of any such effort, given his prominence and credibility. The organizers of the planned campaign, particularly in South Carolina, should seek his advice.
The effort to build confidence in the vaccines got a boost last week when former Presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush and Bill Clinton said they would take a vaccine when it becomes available and are willing to be filmed doing it. Their example could help allay some fears.
The most recent poll that revealed the scope of distrust or uncertainty among black and Hispanic Americans was conducted by Langer Research for the COVID Collaborative, the NAACP and Unidos US, a leading Hispanic advocacy group. Similar Pew Research Center polls also found blacks far more wary of a vaccine, but in an optimistic sign, people of all races are growing more comfortable with the idea than they were two months ago.
""It's not having a vaccine that saves lives, it's actually people getting vaccinated,"" Harvard School of Public Health Dean Michelle Williams told The Washington Post.
Professor Howard Koh of the Harvard School added that doctors need to know more about the development process for the vaccines, which work differently than traditional vaccines. ""A doctor who can't commit to a vaccine personally may find it difficult, if not impossible, to advise their patients to do so,"" Dr. Koh told the Post. It's crucial, he said, for companies developing vaccines to publish full results from clinical trials as soon as possible to persuade physicians that the vaccine is safe.
Those words ring particularly true after drugmaker AstraZeneca recently acknowledged a mistake in the vaccine dosage received by some of its study participants.
Building trust in the safety and efficacy of the new vaccines will be critical to the success of any COVID-19 vaccination campaign.","VACCINES (97%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); CLINICAL TRIALS (90%); DRUG SAFETY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); POLLS & SURVEYS (90%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (90%); AFRICAN AMERICANS (89%); HISPANIC AMERICANS (89%); ANTI-VACCINE MOVEMENT (78%); CONSPIRACY THEORY (78%); DISINFORMATION & MISINFORMATION (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); POPULATION SIZE (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (78%); RACE & ETHNICITY (78%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (77%); ALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPS (75%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (75%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (75%); PUBLIC OFFICIALS (75%); ELECTIONS & POLITICS (73%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (72%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (72%); PROFESSIONAL WORKERS (72%); PUBLIC SCHOOLS (70%); SOCIAL MEDIA MISINFORMATION (70%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (69%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012 (69%); PROFESSIONAL SPORTS (67%); Gambia (%); Coronavirus (%)

2020-12-22,On Covid-19 Vaccine! [opinion],,"Op Ed, jointly submitted by Her Excellency Ms Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey (MP), Her Excellency Ms Retno L.P. Marsudi, Her Excellency Dr Katrin Eggenberger, Her Excellency Ms Ine Eriksen Sreide, His Excellency Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, His Excellency Mr Ignazio Cassis, the Foreign Ministers of Ghana, Indonesia, Liechtenstein, Norway, Singapore and Switzerland:
We the peoples of the United Nations... reads the immortal opening line of the Charter of the United Nations (UN). It paints a picture of the creation of an organisation from the ashes of WWII. A coming together of nations to overcome adversity.
Now 75 years on, in the face of a global pandemic, we must again live up to our founding principles. As the Secretary-General of the UN, Antonio Guterres has underlined, COVID-19 is the greatest test that we have faced since the formation of the United Nations. A virus that is oblivious to national boundaries or immigration procedures in its trajectory of destruction and pain across our world. A formidable threat to the human race, this challenge undoubtedly requires a multilateral response for meaningful impact.
This is why our countries Ghana, Indonesia, Liechtenstein, Norway, Singapore and Switzerland have come together at the UN to draft the first resolution on the fight against COVID-19 (A/RES/74/270 Global Solidarity to fight the COVID-19).
While a resolution on the given crisis of the day is to be expected from the UN, this one represents much more. It is a signal of global solidarity. It is a show of force.
It is the first intergovernmental statement from the UN on COVID-19 but it certainly will not be the last. This resolution is an overdue first step, to convey a message to people around the world that the UN is responding to this crisis.
Beyond the words of the General Assembly, we must now give our full support to the UNs operational work at the service of the countries and the people most in need of international cooperation. This human crisis has proven to be a monumental national challenge for every government, to re-allocate their resources, and reformulate their priorities. While on the frontline, our health care professionals and other essential workers are risking their lives  literally, to save humanity.
The UN system, in particular the World Health Organisation (WHO), is playing a central role in mobilising and coordinating the worldwide response to this pandemic and supporting national efforts. Beyond the short term, the WHO, in addition to addressing urgent humanitarian needs, is also dealing with the inevitable long-term economic, social and developmental consequences of this crisis, and building future resilience.
The UN with its convening power, and resources on the ground is best placed to bring together not just every country, but also every possible partner, from civil society to the private sector. To overcome this health emergency with a spirit of solidarity, we need to promote action without stigma or discrimination, and to ensure that no one in our society is left behind.
It is imperative to underscore that personal and individual efforts are required to complement national and international response to the pandemic. The worlds population is, therefore, reminded that the first frontline of the fight against COVID-19 is your front door. Hence, the call on people to stay at home for better containment. It is vitally important that every individual adheres to the social distancing and enhanced hygiene protocols.
The challenges we face remain vast. Nevertheless, the resolution adopted on 2 April 2020 expresses our optimism. We have put on record our conviction that the unprecedented crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic can be mitigated, and successfully reversed, through leadership and sustained global cooperation. We hope this resolution is one of we the peoples, towards a new kind of multilateralism, where the UN again rises to face a global challenge with a truly united response.","EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (99%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); UNITED NATIONS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (90%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLE (89%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (78%); INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS & BODIES (78%); ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES & WORKERS (77%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (77%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (77%); IMMIGRATION (77%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (75%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (70%); PROFESSIONAL WORKERS (50%)

2020-04-24,Singapore : UNGA Resolution on COVID-19 - Op Ed,,"By Jim Garamone
Two Navy hospital ships deployed to New York and Los Angeles to aid in fighting the pandemic are winding down operations, Jonathan Rath Hoffman, assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs, said Friday.
The USNS Comfort left New York harbor for its home port in Norfolk Friday. The USNS Mercy in Los Angeles has stopped accepting new patients.
""These are both welcome signs that the American public is following CDC guidelines and the number of COVID-19 cases are decreasing,"" Hoffman said. ""Local hospital capacity in these two areas have been sufficient to meet the demand.""
This does not mean that DOD personnel are out of the fight against coronavirus, though. In New York — the hardest hit area in the country — there are almost 700 uniformed doctors and nurses deployed in hospitals in the city and surrounding areas, Hoffman said.
But the DOD has worldwide missions, responsibilities and interests, and the Pentagon spokesman highlighted some of them.
He announced that British Royal Navy Commodore James Parkin turned over command of the International Maritime Security Construct in Manama, Bahrain to British Royal Navy Commodore Rob Bellfield in a virtual ceremony. The construct is meant to secure the vitally important Arabian Gulf region from malign actions. A total of eight nations participate in the construct and Parkin said he expects more to join.
He also noted that yesterday the U.S. Transportation Command awarded a $7.2 billion global household goods contract to the American Roll-on, Roll-off Carrier Group of New Jersey. The contract is for relocating service members and their families.
Hoffman also announced that two Navy ships — the USS Barry and USS Bunker Hill — conducted freedom of navigation operations this week in the South China Sea. The ships ""started and ended a full transit at a time and place of our choosing, as we always do,"" he said. ""The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate to challenge excessive maritime claims in order to preserve the rights, freedoms and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations under international law.""
Finally, he announced that DOD representatives will testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee next week on the Federal Communications Commission decision to award Ligado Networks to deploy a 5G system that could disrupt the Global Positioning System. Dana Deasy, DOD's chief information officer; Michael Griffin, undersecretary of defense for research and engineering; and Space Force Gen. John Raymond, the chief of space operations and commander of U.S. Space Command, will testify before the panel.

2020-05-02,"DOD Spokesman Briefs On COVID-19 Ops, Bahrain Command, 5G Problems",,"CLARK FREEPORT, May 20 -- The Clark Development Corporation (CDC) ordered on Wednesday the closure and full lockdown of the Fontana Resorts and Leisure Park here.
The closure order came after the Criminal Investigation and Detection Group (CIDG) Regional Field Unit of the Philippine National Police (PNP) Region 3, Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and the CDC conducted a joint operation Tuesday and raided a villa illegally operating as a makeshift medical facility for Chinese patients.
During the raid, a seven-bed underground coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) hospital for Chinese nationals were discovered, including a patient inside villa 628 at Florida Street, Fontana Resorts and Leisure Park.
""This illegal activity not only violates the law but also poses danger to individuals who potentially need medical treatment for the deadly disease. CDC does not and will never tolerate this inside the Clark Freeport,"" the CDC said in a statement.
Arrested during the raid were two Chinese nationals -- Ling Hu, 45, the alleged owner of the underground hospital; and Seung-Hyun Lee, 38, an alleged pharmacist.
The suspects are now detained at Camp Olivas, City of San Fernando, Pampanga.
The Covid-19 patient admitted inside the makeshift facility was transferred in a medical facility.
""Aside from the operators who are now facing criminal charges, the CDC will also hold into account the management of Fontana for allowing this to happen within their property. We assure Clark stakeholders, the locators, local communities and residents especially, that we will not stop until all those involved are prosecuted and punished,"" the CDC said.
Police said the suspects will be charged with violations of Republic Act 9711 or the ""Food and Drug Administration Act of 2009"", and Republic Act 2382 or the ""Medical Act of 1958"" for illegally operating without clearance and permit with the Department of Health (DOH) and Inter-Agency Task Force for the Management of Emerging Infectious Diseases (IATF EID).
The raiding team also discovered several medicines with Chinese labels and medical wastes inside the villa.

2020-05-20,Fontana locked down for illegal Covid-19 hospital ops,,"By Gloria Oladipo
According to Kaiser Health News, nearly80 percent of rural Americais categorized as a ""medical desert,"" meaningthe nearest hospital is more than 60 minutes away.These hospitals are also much harder pressed to come up with ventilators and personal protective equipment for practitioners — and not to mention COVID-19 tests, which are in short supply everywhere.
Health care in rural America wasin crisiswell before the outbreak,with higher uninsurance rates in the countrysidelimiting access to care and financially undermining health facilities.Despite legislation giving financial relief to some hospitals, over 350 rural hospitals remain at high risk of closing.
Rural communities are at risk of severe outbreaks for other reasons as well.
For one, many rural communitieslack reliable broadband connections. With so much COVID-19 information being transmitted via the internet, some rural residents may miss out on key updates.
Rural residents are alsotypically older, putting them at higher risk of dying from COVID-19. And they disproportionately lack access tohealthy foodand other necessities, which have become only more scarce in the pandemic.
Given the various risk factors associated with rural communities, a coronavirus outbreak in rural communities would be catastrophic. However, some government officials have not shown urgency.
For one, despite warnings from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)on a potential ""second wave"" of COVID-19infections, some governments are easing social distancing mandates. For example,Georgia Governor Brian Kemp is allowing non-essential businesses to reopen.
Meanwhile, the federal response to COVID-19 has utterly failed. In addition to failing to expand severely limited U.S. testing supplies, theWhite House has not kept its promisesto provide more protective equipment or control misinformation.
Indeed, it's been issuing a steady stream of its own misinformation, prompting warnings from health officials that no,you should not inject bleach to treat coronavirus. A direct consequence of Trump's carelessness has been asteady increase of emergency room visits and poison control calls for bleach ingestion.
Rural communities cannot afford to be neglected during the COVID-19 pandemic. Governments at all levels must coordinate their efforts to educate, protect, and care for rural residents during this uncertain time.
In addition to continuing and strengthening local social distancing orders, local governments must continue making resources — like food, shelter, and medical supplies — accessible and free. Accurate information on COVID-19 must also be made accessible, especially for rural residents without an internet connection.
In addition to government help for rural hospitals, temporary and affordable clinics should be created in high-risk areas with limited hospitals. Nationally, testing and protective equipment such as masks and gloves should be readily available regardless of one's location.
The response to COVD-19 will be a true test in capability, resilience, and crisis-planning for all those in positions of power. The neglect of rural communities during this pandemic is yet another way this nation's COVID-19 response continues to fail.

2020-05-04,Rural America Deserves A Real COVID-19 Response – OpEd,,"The socialism I am talking about is not that of opportunistic politicians and ideologues with a one-track mind but the socialism of Patrice Lumumba, Ernesto Cardenal, Germaine Greer and Noam Chomsky. The pursuit of truth and the politics of moderation with the goal of a non-violent society—that is the socialism I fully endorse.
People must have an emotional sense of belonging which gives them a reason to care for life and a spiritual understanding of the ultimate meaning of existence which helps them come to terms with illness and dying. For both of them to happen, they need to have a life of dignity which comes from being equal members of a social group. If socialism has been mocked as fantasy since the dissolution of the Soviet Union, it is time we realized that without a collective vision cutting across national and regional barriers we don't stand a chance in confronting the evil intentions of ignorant men who think they own the world and can do what they believe to be right with impunity.
The ones who are telling us that we shouldn't be politicizing the pandemic are mostly journalists, technocrats and politicians caught up with power who have politicized the world to an extent where we have no real space to think of moral questions any longer. This dubious credit of politicizing everything in sight also goes to so-called intellectuals especially the ones in the comfort zones of universities who enjoy talking more than doing anything to change the world. In sidelining moral questions they have led the world into a situation where most people have no clue what to do any longer.
As we can see it is governments everywhere and organizations concerned with global health such as the W.H.O. with their abysmal preparedness for a calamity of this magnitude that are directly responsible for the current crisis, and must therefore be held accountable in finding a solution that responds to mass demands. To serve the interests of power, people everywhere have been divided along ethnic, race, caste, community, gender, class and language lines. Yet, ironically, if there is one thing that the virus couldn't care less for, it is these artificial divisions made by identity politics of the worst kind imaginable. The virus strikes at the heart of these divisions while gently reminding people that its priorities are altogether different.
The bottom line is that a divided people cannot fight a virus or even come close to understanding it. That might be true of any disease and the countless deaths that happened in the 19thand 20thcenturies at the height of colonialism are proof of that. Identitarians, which I use in a loose sense to indicate identity-based movements and politics, both among the Left and the Right, have shamelessly utilized the fruits of technology to promote their private harem-agendas making it impossible for people to unite across differences.
The current crisis with covid-19 is an historic opportunity for leaderless masses to rise and make demands for a better society. In the Thootikudi protests of 2018 in Tamil Nadu, India, against the Sterlite Copper Factory owned by the powerful mining company Vedanta Limited (Vedanta is one of the schools of Hindu philosophy; just to note the combination of religion and corporate interests), there were no politicians, left- or right- intellectuals, actors or self-appointed spokespersons to initiate the struggle against the company. It was the masses, who figured out that the factory was polluting the environment causing respiratory and other illnesses, that came together to defy the police and break the law. Thirteen protestors were killed but they succeeded in getting the plant shut down.
This, this is what a real protest made by honest, committed people is capable of doing. Where the masses unite, not for hogging the limelight or identity politics as advocated by self-interested bourgeois intellectuals and politicians who represent corporate interests, they can defy the law and order machinery and achieve their goals. I would rather trust leaderless masses who know what they want than those guided from above, which usually end up becoming lynch mobs, without a sense of purpose or direction.
This is a time for leaderless masses to rise globally against governments and the corporate sector and make the following demands: i) Freedom from exploitation at the workplace which means they cannot be hired and fired just like that and their working hours are flexible enough to give them time to spend with their families and friends ii) Access to healthy food that'll build their immunity against disease iii) Healthcare which means they have access to doctors who don't think that they are gods but actually listen to what the patients have to say iv) Housing and the most important of all human dignity which means that the one who sweeps the street and collects the garbage gets a chance to explore new opportunities for personal growth and not be condemned to doing the same thing forever.
The coronavirus pandemic is the right time to fight for a just society. There is no reason on earth why the masses anywhere should believe in their governments or the arrogant and self-serving medical professionals who for decades only spoke the language of money and exploited the helplessness and trust of patients. We need to find a cure for the virus but we also need to find a cure for human-made inequality. Behind any disease there is inevitably the role of a human agent. From the systematic destruction of the environment to the spread of fast-food culture and abusive lifestyles that have no respect for the body and treat the body as if it were a bone in the mouth of a street dog, normal human bodies incapacitated by addictions, overmedication and anti-depressants, everything has generously contributed to the lack of preparedness of communities in simply being able to come together to resist the virus outbreak.
The most important of all is of course the unequal lives in the first worlds and third worlds, between the rich of the third world and the third world poor, between men and women (with poor women often having to bear the brunt of the violence that comes with inequality), with the simple fact that every major institution and organization has compromised in allowing the inequality to flourish without asking any serious questions.
The inequality must go and the time is now: Saint Augustine saw God in the eternal present and Walter Benjamin, ""the sign of a messianic zero-hour [Stillstellung] of events, or put differently, a revolutionary chance in the struggle for the suppressed past."" With a global lockdown of this kind meant to contain the virus it makes no sense for Israeli presence to continue in Palestinian Territories. Similarly it is time that the framers of the American Foreign Policy in the Third World realize that they cannot be putting embargoes on countries which are opposed to them: the American sanctions on Iran and Venezuela are unacceptable because they are inhuman and bring pain to common people. Most importantly, you cannot be making money by selling weapons to the governments in the third world who use them against their own people. As Martin Luther King says, ""Economic exploitation, militarism and racism are inextricably linked."" It is time that they are delinked and things change; while the world discusses how the virus should be contained they should also discuss how inequality at all levels ought to be addressed.
What James Baldwin says of the US is true of nations where governments are fighting a civil war at home and are part of a global war as well. The suppression at home is an excuse for a war outside home; if Pakistan did not exist as an enemy India would have to invent it; the same goes for Pakistan as well, and is true of most other nations which invent an enemy to justify the violence at home. The state of Kashmir that has been on a perpetual lockdown for decades is the tragedy of a people who paid the price for the India-Pakistan rivalry with their bodies and their souls in untold human suffering more than any other people I am a witness to.
Oscar Wilde says inThe Soul of Man Under Socialism: ""For it is through joy that the Individualism of the future will develop itself."" What comes in the way of the individualism that brings joy is majoritarianism. Majoritarianism is not just where a numerically stronger group in a state oppresses its minorities using the government machinery. Majoritarianism happens at different levels: where one person is helpless against his or her neighbors, where one person is singled out because he or she does not subscribe to a popular argument, or for their lifestyle or for the way they are, that's when majoritarianism appears in practice because its greatest enemy is the individual person who chooses to think and feel for him or herself. Whether as family or nation, neighborhood or a social group, majoritarianism has always been opposed to the growth of the person; we can see what organized religion is doing to people across the world by encouraging them to blindly submit to superstitions of the worst kind.
While denouncing organized religion as having everything except faith, Tolstoy observes, ""Whatever answers faith gives, regardless of which faith, or to whom the answers are given, such answers always give an infinite meaning to the finite existence of man; a meaning that is not destroyed by suffering, deprivation or death. This means that only in faith can we find the meaning and possibility of life."" Tolstoy puts faith before everything else; nobody can claim to practice a religion without trying to look for ""the meaning and possibility of life."" In other words, for one to claim to be religious without faith is in fact not to believe in anything at all.
That's what socialism ought to explore: answers that give infinite meaning to our finite existence. People should have faith in themselves to begin with. I am not irrationally opposed to doctors, scientists and medical experts in general. At the same time we've to overcome this subservience to science and technology which can be as dogmatic and orthodox as some of the religious systems. The right amount of doubt is necessary for any system of knowledge that claims to have solutions to problems. To that extent, a guarded approach to ""experts"" in any area of knowledge is not such a bad idea. Ultimately faith that gives a person both meaning and the possibility of life is essential in overcoming the crisis. Medical knowledge might claim to give an objective assessment that faith in oneself cannot. Such a supposition begs the question: why should someone believe in a knowledge that could not predict the arrival of the virus in the first place!
Therefore encouraging people to have the faith that will give them both meaning and the possibility of life is a good thing because it gives them courage and hope to deal with the crisis, which in my view is more important than even the vaccine. Socialism is the basis for such a boundless faith leading to the search for meaning and the possibilities of life because it gives the opportunity for people to be their own, true authentic selves. As Oscar Wilde puts it: ""For what man has sought for is, indeed, neither pain nor pleasure, but simply Life. Man has sought to live intensely, fully, perfectly. When he can do so without exercising restraint on others, or suffering it ever, and his activities are all pleasurable to him, he will be saner, healthier, more civilised, more himself.""

2021-01-05,"Best of BS Opinion: Covid-19 vaccine, promise of techno-nationalism & more",,"Long-suffering Afghanistan is increasingly facing an even more severe threat. Since Feb. 24, 2020, when the country's first Covid-19 case was confirmed in Herat which has border with Iran, a number of provinces incluidng Kabul have imposed curfews and restrictions on the number of people traveling together, as well as limitations on inter-city travel.
Afghanistan is not only fighting Covid-19, but in the midst of the halting prisoner exchange, the Taliban have escalated violence across Afghanistan.The Afghan government said that 291 military personnel were killed in the third week of June 2020 alone, making it one of the deadliest weeks for Afghan forces in the past nineteen years. Escalation of violence and the spread of the Covid-19 are the severe threats for Afghanistan's government to tackle.
The outbreak of Covid-19 has posed a serious challenge to the already overwhelmed and weak health and economic system of Afghanistan. Afghanistan remains an endemic country for several infectious diseases including poliomyelitis, diarrhea and pneumonia that contributes to a majority of deaths in Afghanistan. President Ashraf Ghani recently in an aid distribution ceremony said that 90 percent of the population lives under the poverty line, with less than $2 income every day.
Because of this poverty even though citizens want to follow medical advice and avoid social gatherings, they simply cannot afford it, particularly daily wages laborers. When the country recorded the first positive case of Covid-19 in February, the price of face masks, sanitation items and food item rise significantly. Subsequently, many people lost their jobs and cannot afford their daily meals and they are in dire need of help. The Government does not have comprehensive and sustainable plan to help the poor in this difficult circumstance.
And still, the border with neighboring countries remains open. The Afghanistan Government failed to establish a proper and well-equipped quarantine zone in the initial stage of the pandamic at the Iran-Afghanistan and Pakistan-Afghanistan borders for migrants and this has further increased the risk of Covid-19 transmission into Afghanistan.
On the other hand, delays in result of the tests, lack of trust in hospitals, lack of equipments at hospital, lack of doctor and lack of sufficient quarantine facilities to keep the individual in quarantine has caused frustration among many citizens and also increased the severe spread of this virus.
As per an IOM report between Jan 1 and April, 2020, 18,255,000 Afghans returned from Iran because of the fear of contracting virus and they have lost their jobs. Even under normal circumstance for Afghan refugees it is difficult to get access to facilities such as education facilities, health facilities and if these refugees have been in contact with this virus they are being refused to be treated in Iran's hospitals.
By the end of March, the government had built testing facilities in Herat, Kabul, Balkh, and Kandahar, issued restrictions on mobility, and closed government offices in an effort to stem the spread. These measures, however, seem to be too little, and too late.
The Afghanistan Ministry of Healthy only has the capacity to test 2,000 cases per day, but they are receiving between 10,000 and 20,000 samples each day. That means between 80 and 90 percent of potential cases are not being tested.
As per the International Rescue Committee (IRC), Afghanistan has one of the highest test positivity rates (40%) of all the countries where the IRC works, suggesting a high level of undetected population infection.
In the last week of March, 2020 Kabul and Herat went under lockdown and the movement of citizens became restricted and continued for almost two months.
Later and particularly before Ramadan Eid, and third and fourth weeks of May rumors among people spread that statistics given by government were not true. As such, citizens broke the lockdown and the government's initial efforts for preventing Covid-19 failed.
As per the Afghanistan Public Helath statistics the number of people who were infected was 4,000 the fourth week of May, while the rumor caused people to come out of their homes for Eid shopping, suddenly this figure rose to 10,000.
A lack of trust in the government led people to spread the rumors to the extent that people were saying that government was buying the bodies of those who have died from other diseases from their families to register them as coronavirus deaths to get more funds from international donors.
Due to a lack of trust in hospitals those who are getting infected did not go the hospitals. Daily there are many death announcements in social media, however, many people instead go into hiding even they are infected because of the different treatment from the people.
As per official figures currently there are 35,727 confirmed cases, 23,924 recovered cases and 1,190 deaths. In reality the number of infected people is much more higher than official figures because of the unreported cases and lack of testing. The spreading of rumors and a lack of trust in the government has caused the the initial efforts of government for preventing this disease to fail.
Traditional religious believes have also contributed to the spread of this virus. In spite of all the threats for spreading the virus, many people across Afghanistan -- including Kabul and Herat -- have allowed large crowd gatherings for Friday prayers. Indeed, prior to the April 5, some mullahs were encouraging people to gather in mosques and pray for a cure.
Despite of all these challenges, the Afghanistan government has taken some steps for preventing the wide spread of this disease. The Afghanistan Government formed a committee for fighting Covid-19 and allocated three hospitals in the capital of Kabul and started the construction of a 100-bed hospital for covid-19 patients in the Herat province and 2 million dollar have being allocated for fighting Covid-19.
Some of the poor families are being given bread by the government; however reports suggested a huge amount of money is being wasted in corruption. A report by Afghan newspaper 8:am daily found that Kabul Municipality officials and other relevant officials was involved in corruption of 30% of all fund allocated for bread distribution.
Currently, the Afghanistan government has another program by the name of National Dining Table to help poor, which costs over 244 million dollar. Addressing guests attending the launch of the government's aid distribution program Distarkhan-e-Millie Ghani said, ""poverty is not an incident, it is a tragedy"", however the Afghanistan parliament rejected this program because of the fear of corruption as happened in past aid distribution programs.
Despite sending 236 million AFN to provinces hit hard by Covid-19, including 28 million to Herat, without external support the Afghan government does not have the financial capacity or resources to handle a pandemic of this magnitude.
In short, the government does not have a sustainable plan for dealing with this crises, the aid distribution program by Afghan government is not transparent. People have lost trust in the government and blame it for its failure in responding to Covid-19.
The Afghanistan government has failed to manage financial resources allocated for Covid because of an endemic corruption that has penetrated all parts of the Afghan state, including the response to this crises. In a nutshell, Afghanistans' people could not maintain social distancing because of poverty and they need to earn a living to feed their families.

Jalandoni Provincial Hospital in Silay City, Negros Occidental returned to normal operations on Friday after cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) among its medical and support personnel have dropped.
""We are happy to inform the public that due to the downward trend in Covid-19 infection of TLJPH front-liners, we shall resume regular services for all areas starting today,"" the management headed by chief of hospital Dr. Mary Ann Maestral said in a statement.
Provincial Administrator Rayfrando Diaz II said he discussed the resumption of full operations with Maestral after confirmed Covid-19 cases involving hospital front-liners dropped to only 38 and those quarantined decreased to only eight as of February 2.
On January 25, there were 63 positive cases and 38 under quarantine.
""Some healthcare workers are back to work especially in TLJPH,"" Diaz said.
According to the hospital management, all patient referrals must still be coursed through the province's One Hospital System through the city or municipal health office.
""We again remind the public to refrain from unnecessary exposure and to continue to observe the recommended health protocols to keep cases down in our community,"" it added.
In mid-January, the TLJPH suspended its outpatient services in the obstetrics and gynecology department, where most of the infected personnel are assigned.
The following week, it also suspended its regular services, including those in the out-patient department and Covid-19 vaccination, and limited admissions to extreme emergency cases only.

2022-02-04,NegOcc prov'l hospital resumes ops after Covid-19 cases drop,,"Lockdowns imposed in response to Covid-19 forced millions of people to stay at home, businesses closed and a widespread hush descended. The major beneficiary of the controls has been the natural environment; in particular there has been a dramatic reduction in air pollution everywhere. But as countries begin to lift restrictions, road traffic levels are once again increasing, air and noise pollution rising.
Changes to working patterns and daily living have created a unique opportunity to re-imagine how we live and work. Central to any new pattern needs to be the environment; many people recognize this and the importance of not 'going back'. Some cities in Europe are already responding positively (Milan, London, Bristol e.g.), proposing pedestrian only areas together with an increase in cycle lanes, and the results of a recentsurveyby the Automobile Association (AA) in Britain are encouraging. ""Half of those polled said they would walk more and 40% intended to drive less…to maintain the cleaner air of the lockdown and protect the environment."" In addition around a quarter said they planned to (continue) to work more from home, as well as flying less.
Death by Breathing
According to the World Health Organization (WHO) 90% of the global population breathe filthy toxic air. The bulk of air pollution is the result of burning fossil fuels for heat and power generation (e.g. oil and coal power plants and boilers) and fuel combustion from vehicles – cars, motorbikes, lorries etc. All of which not only throw toxins into the air but also generate enormous levels of noise pollution.
Worldwide, air pollution is said to kill around nine million people a year, making it the fifth leading risk factor for death in the world. Children are particularly vulnerable; they inhale more airborne toxins than adults, tend to spend greater periods of time outside and are more active. The detrimental effects can be long lasting, affecting their physical and mental health as well their education.
Contaminated air is also a significant factor in a person's susceptibility to Covid-19. Air pollution, particularly Nitrogen Dioxide (NO2), as well as Particulate Matter (PM)) – both of which are released by vehicles burning fossil fuels, causes and exacerbates respiratory complaints. A university study conducted in Germanyfoundthat of the total number of coronavirus deaths in 66 administrative regions of Italy, Spain, France and Germany, ""78% of them occurred in just five regions, and these were the most polluted.""
The results of the research ""indicate that long-term exposure to this pollutant may be one of the most important contributors to fatality caused by the Covid-19 virus…poisoning our environment means poisoning our own body, and when it experiences chronic respiratory stress [Covid-19 e.g.] it's ability to defend itself from infections is limited."" A separate study in the USshowsthat even small ""single-unit"" increases in particle pollution in the years prior to the pandemic is linked with a 15% increase in deaths. Cleaner air in London or New York e.g., in the past could have saved hundreds of lives.
Air pollution affects everyone but predictably the poorest members of society, including people from black and minority ethnic (BAME) groups, are the most severely impacted, they appear also to be the most at risk from Covid-19. In multi-cultural Britain e.g., people in deprived areas have been dying of coronavirus at double the rate of those in affluent areas. And those from BAME backgrounds –making up around 13% of the UK population – account for a third of virus patients admitted to hospital critical care units. Similar patterns have emerged in other European countries with large minority populations as well as the US. Black Americans represent around 14 per cent of the US population but total 30 per cent of those who have contracted the virus. In Norway people born in Somalia have infection rates more than 10 times above the national average.
The social causes behind the figures are complex. Many people from BAME groups live in overcrowded housing in extremely polluted areas and work in high-risk low paid jobs. Diet among some BAME communities is poor and (in part as a result) there is a propensity to underlying health conditions such as diabetes, heart disease, obesity and respiratory illnesses, all of which make people more vulnerable to Covid-19.
Poverty is the world's biggest killer, and Covid-19 is, it seems, the most recent addition to the symptomatic causes of death for the poor, the vulnerable and people from minorities, which, in many cases are one and the same.
In addition to causing millions of deaths and a variety of respiratory conditions, air pollution is increasingly being linked to a range of mental health illnesses, including depression, bipolar, and, according to astudyin the UK, psychotic experiences in children.
An estimated 300 million people in the world suffer from depression, a similar number are plagued by anxiety. Many aspects of contemporary living contribute to mental health illnesses, various studies in recent years show that air pollution is one of them. The finest particle pollutants are known to reach the brain via the bloodstream and the nose, The Guardianreport, causing increased brain inflammation, ""damage to nerve cells and to changes in stress hormone production, which have been linked to poor mental health."" Air pollution has also been shown to quadruple the risk of depression in teenagers and is being linked to dementia.
Together with noise pollution, studies show that filthy air feeds sleep apnea symptoms and may disturb sleep by exacerbating asthma, COPD, or other respiratory or chronic diseases. This in turn creates greater vulnerability to depression and anxiety, as well as the current Covid-19 virus.
Changing behavior
Air pollution is poison, we are literally breathing in toxic compounds that are making us ill, physically and mentally. Urgent and lasting steps are required to reduce to an absolute minimum the levels of air pollution. This requires humanity to drastically reduce its dependency on fossil fuels.
For this to happen there needs to be a major shift in attitudes, triggering a change in behavior and greater levels of environmental responsibility. Consumerism (including consumption of animal food produce) is the principle cause of the environmental emergency, including air pollution. Excessive, unnecessary consumption needs to stop, sufficiency not excess promoted and adopted as the guiding principle. Meat and dairy diets reduced and the trend towards plant based diets encouraged.
At the same time investment in renewable sources of energy generation and supply needs to be increased throughout the world. All unnecessary travel should be eliminated (including air travel), and (where practical) a strategic movement away from the car onto public transport – reliable and clean, cycling and walking. Public transport needs to be state owned and run as a service, not for profit. China, with 99% of the world's total electric fleet, leads the way in the electrification of public transport, in addition, the Chinese government has invested heavily in electric cars and has set a target of 40% electric vehicles by 2025.
The beautification of our towns and cities (where over 50% of the world's population now live) goes hand in hand with the reduction in traffic and the promotion of clean modes of transport. Bold imaginative initiatives are required that prioritize the environment and human welfare over corporate concerns. Whole sections of cities and towns, major streets and abandoned sites could be redesigned as peaceful green spaces. And while many fear the closure of retail outlets and the slow death of shopping streets, the possibility of converting these areas to parklands and gardens, present itself and should be embraced.
All flows from a shift in thinking. The environmental emergency is the greatest crisis facing humanity; with every new report published the scope and depth of the crisis becomes increasingly stark, the need for action more urgent. To date the complacency of governments and corporations, as well as large tracts of the public, has been astonishing and shameful; this must now change.
Covid-19 forced governments to act (albeit in many cases inadequately); the same sense of urgency needs to be applied to tackling air pollution, which, I say again, is responsible for at least nine million deaths a year, and the wider environmental emergency. The pandemic has given the natural environment a brief respite from human abuse; as countries 'open up', we have the chance to adopt a new responsible approach to living and not revert to old destructive ways.

2020-05-29,Air Pollution Mental Illness And COVID-19 – OpEd,,"Deaths from malaria could double if the fight against coronavirus comes at the expense of anti-malaria efforts, warns Sierra Leone's Health Minister.
In 2014, Sierra Leone - along with Liberia and Guinea - battled a devastating outbreak of Ebola. This deadly challenge taught us a lot, from the importance of tackling misinformation to ensuring rapid testing and treatment. In my country alone, we lost close to 4,000 lives to the virus.
This was a tragedy for our nation. People often forget, however, that during this difficult time, we lost even more lives to malaria. In Sierra Leone, this mosquito-borne disease has been a long-standing foe, with 1.78 million malaria cases confirmed in 2018.
Many African countries similarly struggle with malaria, which is why all 55 heads of state of the African Union launched the continent-wide Zero Malaria Starts with Me campaign in July 2018. Since then, the pan-African movement that calls for all citizens to take ownership of the fight end malaria has gone from strength to strength. 15 countries have now launched the campaign nationally, including Sierra Leone in 2019.
At the same time, however, our progress against malaria is under threat today. COVID-19 is taking hold of public health efforts to the extent that malaria deaths are set to double in 2020, according to recent World Health Organisation modelling.
We cannot let the fight against COVID-19 come at the detriment of our mission to end malaria. It is crucial that countries across Africa continue to scale up their malaria programmes and ensure the disease remains a priority. After all, malaria continues to claim the lives of over 400,000 people each year globally.
Since March 2020, Sierra Leone has been fighting to control the spread of COVID-19. However, we have continued to provide essential malaria services. We decided to push forward with our planned mass distribution of 4.6 million long-lasting insecticide-treated nets (LLINs), enough that every single Sierra Leonean can sleep under a bed net every night, all year round. We had to act quickly as the rainy season, the period of peak malaria transmission, was not going to wait for us.
LLINs are tried and tested interventions, proving to be the most cost-effective tools against malaria. The development and scaled up distribution of these nets over the last two decades are responsible for approximately 68% of the prevented malaria cases in Africa. They are just one element of a successful malaria control programme, but an important one that empowers communities to protect themselves against mosquitos.
Of course, the distribution of these nets did not come without challenges. Supply chains of key malaria commodities have been strained, and COVID-19 put our brave community health workers at heightened risk even with protective equipment and the government's campaign encouraging ""less touching"". To try to address these challenges, we set up even more distribution points, hired additional campaign staff, provided hand washing stations, and required recipients to wear facemasks and practice social distancing.
Everyone in Sierra Leone is affected by malaria, which is why we have engaged a wide range of stakeholders from all areas of society: members of parliament, mayors, religious leaders, paramount chiefs, the media, local councils, health and government officials, civil society organisations, traders, celebrities, footballers, models, actors, musicians and comedians. Using their voices and influence, these leaders are essential for ensuring people know how to stay safe and to seek diagnosis and treatment if experiencing a fever.
Our commitment to ending malaria is something we are proud of in Sierra Leone. However, malaria does not respect borders. Mosquitoes are not bound by country limits. That is why we call on neighbouring African countries to learn from our experience and continue to scale up malaria programmes despite the challenges of COVID-19. Naturally, we have had successes and failures; however, collaboration and knowledge sharing continue to be the best way of ensuring that only the successes are repeated.
2020 marks the beginning of a new decade, one in which we must strive to build stronger and more resilient health systems and to collectively mobilise to put an end to public health crises such as malaria.

2020-08-04,"We Must Continue to Scale Up Malaria Programmes, Despite Covid-19 [opinion]",,"Mar 24, 2020( Ventureburn: http://ventureburn.com Delivered by Newstex)  The Covid-19 pandemic, which has been declared a National Disaster and has prompted a 21-day national shut down, is having catastrophic effects on businesses throughout South Africa and around the globe. Micro, small and medium enterprises are among the hardest hit by the crisis. Government departments have been inundated with enquiries from small firms, requesting help to mitigate the devastating impact the pandemic is having on their livelihoods.Government's commitmentThe Minister of Small Business Development Khumbudzo Ntshavheni, announced that the SA government is introducing support measures for SMMEs during this extremely difficult time (see this story[1]). The department's proposed Debt Relief Fund will offer qualifying small businesses much-needed repayment relief, which will assist many business owners who are currently finding their debts unserviceable. 
Business owners who face cash flow challenges must make contact with their banks, suppliers and other creditors sooner rather than later In order for small firms to qualify for assistance from the Fund, they will need to demonstrate a direct link of the impact, or potential impact, of Covid-19 on their businesses.Assistance from banksSome of the banks have also started announcing lifelines that they will be extending to their small business customers. Standard Bank was first to the party, offering a three-month payment holiday for debt repayments for qualifying business customers with an annual turnover of less than R20-million. Furthermore, the bank recently made a statement on Twitter, committing to reach out to their vehicle and home loan customers individually with payment relief options. Nedbank are encouraging their customers to get in touch with them directly. They will be offering solutions including debt repayment holidays, extended loan periods, or short-term credit extensions on a case-by-case basis. They will make further announcements regarding their relief offerings in the coming days.Be proactiveNow, more than ever, it is the performance of the small business sector that will determine the fate of the country's economy going forward. With a severely constrained fiscus and looming mass retrenchments by corporates, it is critical that the small business sector is strongly supported through this crisis. Business owners who are facing cash flow challenges, to make contact with their banks, suppliers and other creditors sooner rather than later. In this time of uncertainty, it is important that business owners take immediate steps to ensure they have the cash-flow reserves needed for the months ahead. Ironically, the best time to apply for finance is when it is least needed, when business is booming. This is when lenders are more likely to approve credit facilities that are then available to the business owner for these kinds of unplanned crises. Of course, if you haven't already secured the money you need to bridge you through this tough time, then the next best time to apply for finance is now, before you hit the cash cliff. Finfind[2] has a database of over 600 small business finance offerings. Business owners can complete Finfind's online questionnaire which will match them with finance offerings. *Darlene Menzies is the CEO and founder of FinFind.

2020-03-24,Relief for small business owners during Covid-19 time [Opinion],,"Yaakov Litzman, who was Israeli Minister of Health for the past 9 years was reported by members of his own community as having violated the orders of his own Health ministry by attending worship service with ten or more men that had been forbidden, in order to prevent the spread of the corona virus in Israel.
At the beginning of the coronavirus crisis in Israel, Litzman acted to exclude the ultra-Orthodox community from social-distancing rules and to permit mikvehs (ritual public baths) and synagogues to continue to operate. He even promised that the Messiah would come and eliminate the pandemic.
Litzman's version of religion—in his case, Ultra-Orthodoxy connected with the Gur Hasidic group—is both anti-modern and anti-Zionist. His brand of extremist other-worldly Judaism rejects science and the scientific method.
Litzman's views are Israel's version of America's evangelical groups-as in the case of Florida and other southern states, where their leadership have been telling their followers –and in some cases are still telling them—to continue to go to worship services, despite what the governmental authorities are telling them about the danger this poses to their own health and the health of the public.
Indeed, Litzman's Ultra-Orthodox views are close to those of the religious leaders of Pakistan and Iran. In Pakistan, powerful Muslim clerics forced the government to leave mosques open throughout Ramadan. Mullah Abdul Aziz of the Red Mosque in the capital, Islamabad, ordered adherents to pack communal prayers and Friday worshipers were shoulder-to-shoulder.
And Iran's Imam Muhammad Saeedi opposed restricting the city of Qom, home to the country's top Islamic clerics, which each week has thousands of pilgrims paying their respects by kissing and touching the numerous shrines and landmarks.
Instead of quickly quarantining the city, Imam Mohammad Saeedi campaigned for pilgrims to keep on visiting.
""We consider this holy shrine to be a place of healing. That means people should come here to heal from both spiritual and physical diseases."" said Imam Mohammad Saeedi.
""We should have quarantined Qom from day one... this disease is not a joke, which is the way we are dealing with it,"" vice-speaker of Iran's parliament and former Health Minister Massoud Pezeshkian said.
Now infections rising in country's southwest despite declines elsewhere as total infections hit 106,220 and the death toll reaches 6,589 But a report by the research arm of Iran's parliament said 11,700 may have died. In Tehran, the municipal council said it had to add 10,000 new graves to its largest cemetery, Behesht e-Zahra.
So between 6500 (government) and 11,000+ Iranians have died because of narrow minded religious politicians in Iran; and in Israel where the Ultra-Orthodox are only 11% of Israel's population, they make up more than half of those with Covid-19 in Israel today. 
Israel's Interior minister recently urged 'soul-searching' in ultra-Orthodox community citing the very high coronavirus infection rate [around 70% of the sick in the entire country are ultra-Orthodox who are only 11 percent of the general population] Aryah Deri said in an interview with an ultra-Orthodox news site.
He said that Ultra-Orthodox Jewish communities abroad had also been disproportionately affected, with high infection rates in the New York neighborhoods of Borough Park, Williamsburg and Crown Heights.
Jerusalem and Bnei Brak, two strongholds of Israel's ultra-Orthodox population, account for 37 percent of the country's coronavirus deaths, according to official figures. Bnei Brak residents were 14 percent of deaths and Jerusalem's heavily ultra-Orthodox neighborhoods accounted for 23% of all deaths. The average age of those who died is 81.3.
The Torah has several commandments regarding personal and public safety. For instance, Jews are instructed to build a fence around any flat roof, to prevent anyone from falling off the roof.
The 12th century Spanish/Moroccan Philosopher and M.D. Rabbi Moses Maimonides explains this to include any dangerous situation, such as an unguarded swimming pool.
In addition to removing hazards, the Torah twice commands Jews to protect our health, safety and well being. For example, the Talmud forbids walking near a shaky wall, lest it fall and injure the passerby.

I am sure that Sharia law also contains such statements of caution. But we all need religious leaders who can find them and follow them. Fortunately, the majority of the Israeli government is not politically Orthodox religious and Israel reacted very quickly to the Covis-19 danger and its death rate is under 2 percent.

In the face of so many uncertainties created by the coronavirus disease Covid-19, count on the pandemic to accelerate long-building trends in the logistics industry, from spending more on technology than hiring to readjusting the so-called sweet spot for the sizes of massive container ships plying global trade lanes. While it's still too soon to determine the extent of which these trends will be hastened, Covid-19 will push the industry closer to a future where digitalization is nearly omnipresent, automation is ingrained, and logistics has adapted to slower trade as the economic windfalls of globalization fade further.
With ocean and surface freight volumes falling at a double-digit pace - thanks to Covid-19 shelter-in-place orders sapping global consumer and manufacturing demand - the pressure is on container lines to logistics managers to eke out efficiencies while still staying competitive and adapting to a new economic landscape.
It's unsurprising then that among logistics professionals who said they expect to make a change in the wake of Covid-19, 76% said they will invest in technology, according to a survey conducted by the website Shipping and Freight Resource on behalf of ocean freight visibility software provider Ocean Insights. Comparatively, just 33% of the approximately 130 logistics professionals who reported preparing for major changes said they would be hiring new employees.
Some of those technology investments will allow some workers not to return to the office once restrictions are lifted, as many of those offices will be closed or at least made smaller due to cut costs. But much of those investments will be focused on automating work processes, allowing employees to work on high-level tasks, and as a result, lessening the need to hire even when demand returns.
The accelerated pace of digitalization - and its near cousin, automation - will exacerbate divides in the industry, and speed up consolidation. That's going to further shake up the livelihoods of freight forwarders, those who help companies arrange for the transport of their containerized goods from factory floor to final delivery. They make their money on high-volume, lower margins and have to keep shipments flowing at high levels to achieve efficiencies and economies of scale to cover their heavy fixed costs.
But as the middlemen between shippers, container carriers and airlines, when demand and capacity plunges as it has been in terms of ocean and air service, that model takes some wear. The average revenue of the 275 forwarder members within the Airforwarders Association has dropped more than 50% during the Covid-19 crisis, forcing 65% of the group's members to lay off or make plans to cut staff, according to Brandon Fried, the group's executive director.
""There's no doubt in my mind that the situation over the last 30 days and in the foreseeable future will greatly impact the health of many forwarders for years to come."" said Chris Connell, senior vice president of perishables, North America, at Commodity Forwarders, a subsidiary of Kuehne + Nagel.
Small and midsize forwarders were challenged before Covid-19, but now the ""big are going to get bigger and the small and medium-sized forwarders [those with annual revenues of up to $700 million] are going to go under unless they invested in technology and specialization,"" said logistics industry analyst Cathy Roberson.
Hinting at how Covid-19 will change the nature of global trade, Rodolphe Saadé, chairman and CEO of CMA CGM, one of the five largest container lines, said in an April 17 video statement that the pandemic's impact on ""world economic flow"" requires a complete reconsideration of how international container transport operates. ""Supply chains will need to adapt to sharp fluctuations between supply and demand,"" he said.
Part of that adaptation is adjusting physical assets to not only lower demand but more intense bursts of cargo, as well as a trading environment in which systemic risk and protectionist trade policies encourage more regional supply chains. That will likely push the industry to rightsize its need for larger vessels.
While the payback of ultra-large container vessels (UCLVs), those with capacities of more than 15,000 TEU, has been questioned in recent years, ""the current crisis might cause a rethink in vessel size,"" said Theo Notteboom, a Europe-based academic in maritime studies.
Economies of scale only work when a ship is full, which typically only happens on headhaul trades at peak periods. Expectations of low global volume growth and that ULCVs can only be deployed on the Asia-Europe trades makes them an odd fit for a post-coronavirus world marked by slower trade growth that will be more regional than global in scope.
""Supply chain dispersal will become more pronounced,"" said Lars Jensen, CEO of Sea-Intelligence Maritime Consulting. He said carriers should begin now to plan for the trade patterns that will emerge in the coming decades as developing nations increase their import and export volumes. ""We need to be clear on the standard vessel needed by 2050 and start ordering them for fleet replenishment,"" Jensen said.

2020-05-15,"Opinion: Covid-19 Hastens Leaner, More Tech-Dependant Future for Logistics",,"The predictions about catastrophe of coronavirus grow more ominous with every passing day, world health organization disclosed that it imposes a great menacing and global threat than terrorism. It's explicitly bad enough and agonizing for the whole world. This pandemic threatened an economic crisis as well a health crisis, the economists have anticipated that the global financial institutions are on the verge of collapse. The coronavirus pandemic is a world-shattering event whose far-ranging consequences are gruesome for the whole world. It has brought severe consequences to the global economy, the stock markets around the world disrupted significantly, exposed competences of governments and millions of people have lose their jobs as the pandemic undoubtedly leads to recession. All over the world, every country closed down its economic, political, educational and social activities, the future has been uncertain.
According to the world's prominent bio-scientists, this pandemic disease could adversely affect approximately 60% of the world's population and that could cause causalities of more than 45 million people. This fact should be clear that such infectious disorders are quite formidable because, it spreads with exponential growth, as tens of cases become hundreds and hundreds become thousands. Any country doesn't appear that has been completely successful at 100% containment and drive this virus back to wildlife. It's disheartening every single individual but it also gives some sort of motivation to take precautionary measures. Up till now, According to the World Health Organization, the Covid-19 has affected more than 300,000 people in at least 186 countries, approximately 13,000 people have died and almost 95,000 have been recovered as well.
Initially, the new viral disease Covid-19, which smacked China at the beginning of December started escalating from its epicentre Wuhan and now it has been moved all around the world. At the earlier stage, when the team of Chinese doctors who have confirmed this news, were arrested and interrogated by Chinese authorities, they have asked to remain silent and to avoid speaking out in public. They were even castigated and suspended for a certain period by the Chinese government. Chinese officials at first suppressed news of this disease, which became a grave error that allowed the virus to take hold, gradually the cases get increases and finally the Chinese government decided to take serious steps and start lock downing major cities like Wuhan, Hubei and Beijing to curb Covid-19. The authorities imposed largest and draconian quarantine over its people, Factories shut down, public transport got stuck and people were ordered to remain indoors. Although, these were tough conditions but without it, China would by now have to register millions of cases and thousands of deaths but this strategy worked out tremendously. Now after huge suffering, China is coming back in normal routine but the severity of Covid-19 in rest of the world regions are getting abhorrent and dreadful.
The whole of Europe has been locked down for two weeks and precautionary measure are being taken by every country as this viral disease infected a huge chunk of masses in Europe. At the beginning of February, Italian authorities announced that a cluster of few cases of Covid-19 has been detected in Lombardy (a global hub of Italy's finance). By the next day, the number was up to 100 and around 10 elderly people had died. The affluent Italian region having outstanding medical facilities, they have thought that we will cope with this disease but then a wave of people turning into pneumonia. The hospitals run out of ventilators and oxygen, exhausted medical staff at the hospital forced people and leave untreated patients to die. Currently, there is a very stringent lockdown; police officers are patrolling everywhere, people are stopped to avoid any movement, every single sector either it's economic, educational, technical or political institution, have been closed in European countries. Despite, all these tough and rigorous measures, the number of deaths in Italy are 4825, Spain 1378, China 3255, Iran 1556 and still various cases are critical.
Iran, where the first Covid-19 cases were reported two days before Italy, has also closed schools, national institutions and cancelled all events. The worship and flow of pilgrims increased the chances of spreading Civid-19 with exponential growth in Iran and now, it has appeared with dire consequences. The number of deaths in Iran is more than one thousand and still various cases are critical. Epidemiologists have suggested earlier that the number of people who have left china infected with Covid-19 is significantly higher than those of infected people; it would be spread from country to country and it had happened true as we have seen the cases in approximately 186 countries, the situation is still terrible because the virus's spread had been underestimated.
The economic impacts of coronavirus are also devastating and stressful, according to world's financial markets, the spread of Covid-19 caused a massive sell-off, and stock markets had fallen 10% in America, 9% in Europe and 8% in Asia over the past few days. The industries, commodities, cross-border commerce, and securities which are more sensitive to global growth got temporarily ceased. Unfortunately, if this pandemic continues with other diseases, there is a distinct chance that rich economies would slip into recession and obviously, it will bring a fresh set of threats and crises for the whole world. In the west, Covid-19 is explicitly a massive challenge and threat for politicians to overcome this uncertainty, critics are there to create a blame-game but only a concrete solution will help them out against this menace. This virus has already exposed the strengths and flaws of globalization and neoliberal world order, it has tested all political systems in both rich and developed countries, which came into contact with Covid-19.
Laboratory research is still going on all around the world to find some sort of sophisticated vaccine but it will take time. The governments are dealing with real problems and people are demanding a silver-bullet solution to overcome this pandemic. In short, the best time is to aware people about any coming threats with earlier notifications, countries have to learn lessons from it to shun any futuristic vulnerabilities. Businesses need long-term sustainability and continuity of plans, governments must ensure quick and better channel to limit panic circumstances. Similarly, increasing growth of diseases means that health systems are less overwhelmed, which saves lives.  If there is any vulnerability of threats, governments should follow and contact one another to plan and implement pre-emptive measures to contain any complication. The total number of infections throughout the course of this pandemic can be lower by giving better treatment facilities to patients. Better treatment means fewer deaths; similarly, better treatments will help to improve the recovery process. In the end, the health care system still needs reforms and should be prepared for what is coming next, it must include painstaking logistic planning, quick supply of required medical equipment. By now, this work should have been done but anyways, every calamity brings some cautious lessons to learn. May God protect us!

2020-03-22,The Politics Of Pandemics: Tracing The COVID-19 – OpEd,,"Kevin Gallagher is a professor of global development policy at Boston University. Yu Yongding is an academician at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences.
As Graham Allison of Harvard University has warned, ""when a rising power like Athens, or China, threatens to displace a ruling power like Sparta, which had been the dominant power in Greece for a hundred years, or the U.S., basically alarm bells should sound."" Nowadays, the alarm bells are sounding so loud that they are drowning out ideas that would allow the United States and China to escape what Allison called the ""Thucydides Trap.""
There are three paths forward: one may be a dead end, another will lead to ruin, and the third could bring about a global recovery. The first path runs in the direction of what British historian Niall Ferguson has deemed the ""Chimerica"" model: a marriage of the Chinese and U.S. economies. This perspective acknowledges the reality of the twenty-first-century economy, which is deeply integrated via global value chains.
But the Chimerica model may no longer be feasible, owing to the economic imbalances it has spawned. Given the widespread backlash against globalization and China, particularly in the United States, it is increasingly unlikely that a process of deepening Sino-American integration can be revived. If anything, a broad ""decoupling"" is already underway.
The second path would lead to a more adversarial arrangement, with China and America each seeking to weaken the other. This could happen passively: one power might watch with folded arms as the other experiences difficulties. Alternativelyk, one or both sides could actively encourage domestic upheavals against the other, or even engage in outright sabotage. It should go without saying that choosing this route would be not only immoral but dangerous. No responsible politician should advocate such a ruinous race to the bottom
The third path leads toward restored mutual trust, by focusing on common interests and fighting common enemies. Returning to Allison's historical paradigm, it is worth remembering that while Sparta emerged as the winner of the Peloponnesian War, it nonetheless suffered a subsequent decline, opening the way for the peripheral Greek kingdom of Macedon to rise to power.
In today's case, once China determined that Covid-19 was a serious threat, it made huge sacrifices to contain the virus, thereby creating a window of opportunity for the U.S. and the rest of the world to start preparing. Having flattened the contagion curve within its own borders, China is now demonstrating global solidarity by sending medical professionals and equipment to other countries in need.
Rather than recognizing China's decisiveness and thanking it for its help, the U.S. has doubled down on disparaging the country. As Malaysian economist Andrew Sheng has observed, ""Anything that China does that is supposed to be good will be treated as a conspiracy for China to grab power. China in the eyes of the West cannot do anything right."" This predisposition is most unfortunate: the history of which Graham reminds us should not be forgotten, especially when it is repeating itself.
It does not have to be this way. Starting today, China and the U.S. could begin to rebuild their relationship through bilateral and jointly led global initiatives to stem the Covid-19 pandemic and put the global economy back on a sustainable growth path.
Although Sino-American relations have been strained for some time now, the two countries have a history of coming together to fight common enemies. After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks against the U.S., China and America worked side by side to counter the threat posed by Al Qaeda and its ilk. Then, after the 2008 financial crisis, they came together again to pull the world back from the brink of global depression. And in 2014, China and the U.S. signed a deal that paved the way for the Paris climate agreement.
As a global crisis, the Covid-19 pandemic should also be treated as a common enemy. Viruses, after all, neither respect political borders nor have any ethnicity or nationality. No country acting on its own can win the war against this one. For now, at least, our common interest in defeating Covid-19 far outweighs our differences. By demanding that China and the U.S. take the third path, the Covid-19 crisis has offered a way out of the Thucydides Trap.
To be sure, any two large countries with histories as rich and varied as those of China and the U.S. are bound to have their differences. In recent years, those differences have accentuated tensions in China-U.S. relations. But there is no denying that both countries have the same core interests in combating global challenges like the Covid-19 pandemic, climate change, financial instability, and any number of other common enemies that may emerge in the future.
Unlike China and the U.S., emerging markets and developing countries lack the wherewithal to protect themselves from the new pandemic threat. Together, China and the U.S. should offer bold proposals for more financing through a new issue of the IMF's global reserve currency, Special Drawing Rights, as well as debt relief for poorer countries. Only then will struggling governments have the fiscal space to combat the pandemic and restart their economies. If the virus and the economic crisis are still present anywhere, they will pose a risk everywhere, including China and the U.S.

2020-04-28,Opinion: Covid-19 Offers Way Out of Thucydides Trap,,"""As more and more forest is cleared around the world, environmental scientists fear that the next deadly pandemic could emerge from what lives within them"", so wrote Jonathan Watts ""in Habitat loss threatens all our future"" for the Guardian on November 17, 2018, and Katarina Zimmer in ""Deforestation tied to changes in disease dynamics"" the Scientist, January 29 2019.
Today, we are in 2020 and the world is confronting it. Scientists are convinced by facts that many infectious diseases emerging from deforestation have the power to devastate economies, and upset the daily lives of people around the world.
We already know about the Lyme disease, the dengue, the yellow fever, malaria, all diseases linked to forest loss and transmitted by insects-vectors, but new diseases are emerging through the slash and burn of the tropical forests and originated in forest-dwelling animals.
'The more we're disturbing this natural habitat, the more we're shaking the pot,"" Zimmer quoted scientist Amy Vittor, an epidemiologist at the University of Florida's Emerging Pathogens Institute. With a range of diseases, ""the links are becoming clear that disturbance leads to downstream emergence events"" in humans, Zimmer wrote.
Zimmer added that Catherine Moyes, a spatial ecologist at the University of Oxford's Big Data Institute, cautions against making claims about causal links between deforestation and P. knowlesi, noting that the algorithm the team used isn't capable of proving cause and effect. Nevertheless, there is evidence for an association.
Through a similar approach in 2016, her model predicted that some of the mosquito vectors that carry P. knowlesi are likely to occur in areas with forest disturbance. A separate statistical analysis by Fornace and her colleagues also found that P. knowlesi cases in humans were positively associated with forest loss over time.
The mechanisms that drive this relationship are unclear. Deforestation may simply be bringing humans into contact with forest-dwelling macaques and infected mosquitoes, as people move into cleared areas and macaques closer to human settlements. In addition, the clearing of trees may shift the locations of breeding sites for mosquitoes that thrive at forest edges. These mechanisms are thought to play a role in a range of vector-borne diseases.
And as tropical forests are being felled worldwide at an alarming rate, scientists are becoming increasingly concerned that future pandemics may arise from humans' destruction of forests. Zimmer added in her article.
The role of forests is important to protect biodiversity and absorb carbon dioxide emissions and also protect human health by preventing the emergence of infectious diseases.
The best way to prevent the emergence of new diseases is to let the indigenous communities live in the land which belongs to them with the animals which are part of their daily lives, and do not create protected areas kicking them out.
It is the growing pace of habitat loss which is the source of growing vulnerability to pandemics, and cutting down forests and expanding roads, towns and industrial activities creates the pathways for animal microbes to adapt to the human body, according to scientists who face the critical mystery to solve the animal origin of the virus as microbes live harmlessly in animal bodies.
But animals alone are not to blame for the recent rise in outbreaks of deadly viruses throughout the world. Humans have a bigger role in contributing to this pandemic phenomenon as they have started entering the ecosystem of these animals as a consequence of deforestation.
Let's not forget that only 15% of the world's rainforests still remain intact while the rest has been converted into farmland for agriculture or even developed in order to accommodate the ever-increasing population.
""It is well established that deforestation can be a strong driver of infectious disease transmission,"" Dr. Franca Sciuto and A.Mac Donald of Earth Research Institute said.

2020-06-13,Environmental Scientists Saw COVID-19 Coming – OpEd,,"COVID-19 is a pandemic disease which has wrapped the whole world in its trap resultantly thousands of people throughout the world are dying because of this virus. Moreover, the world's most developed countries are very serious and suffering from multiple problems because of the fast spread of Coronavirus. Global financial and social structures have been experiencing the worst times of the 21st Century.
Most of the countries throughout the world are focusing on and investing a huge amount of money to fight against COVID-19. The nations which have high literacy rate, understanding of circumstances, sophisticated systems, sense of responsibility, care for saving the lives of their people, care for humanity, and emotions for their people that states have been using their money, skills, expertise, and abilities to overcome the fatal disease.
Whereas in this time of crises, Federal and Sindh Governments of Pakistan are busy in fighting with each other instead of Fighting with COVID-19. Furthermore, Federal and Provincial governments are blaming each other through raising the questions and fingers on the authenticity of their policies and actions against COVID-19. These inefficient, incompetent, unproductive, and disorganized government officials are wasting their energies over blaming each other just for point-scoring. Such nations are considered the dead nations which have never used their minds even in the time of crises. Unfortunately, it looks from their tug of war that they don't have a mind to use and think rationally over things. They are trash and dumb people who are considered mentally ill and dead and their minds have stopped working since very long.
Looking over the blame game between federal and Sindh governments, many PTI persons and ministers such as Faisal Vawda, Ali Zaidi, Firdous Ashiq Awan, Fidous Shamim Naqvi, Haleem Adil Shaikh, Murad Saeed and Malik Shehzad Awan are criticizing and blaming Sindh government for its failure to curb coronavirus. There are various assumptions that the Federal government is doing all this since they want to put the cover on their inefficiencies, incompetence, and failure against curbing COVID-19. Besides, the Federal Minister Faisal Vawda lashed out at the Sindh government's decision to seal 12 UCs of Karachi and blames that it has failed to counter the Coronavirus situation.
He further explained that ""lockdown of the province is not a solution to curb coronavirus"". Likewise, he blamed Sindh government over corruption in funds which have been utilized for eliminating the virus.
In this regard, another PTI worker and very close to PM Imran Khan Dr Shahzad Gill blamed Sindh government on its policies that according to him are useless and without proper planning. In which he blamed Sindh government over other issues such as mentioning its name over Ahsaas program, torture on political workers, and daily conducting 500 tests not more than this.
On the other side, Sindh government spokesperson Murtaza Wahab also criticized the Centre for sending faulty coronavirus testing kits that showed the negligence of Centre including defaming Sindh government since it is working efficiently against COVID-19. Also, Federal government wants to open some industries and hopes people to follow SOP while it is unable to properly distribute money of Ahsaas program to the people that seems thousands of people gathered to collect money without following the guidelines provided by the government.
Sindh Information Minister Syed Nasir Hussain Shah said that if the Federal government had taken timely preventive measures the situation would have been different. Further, he told that when Sindh government decided to impose a lockdown the PM response was not positive. He explained that the federal government did not show seriousness to fight against coronavirus that's why the Sindh government's measures were also misreported by the federal government.
As a result of the fight between both Centre and provinces, masses are the real victims and suffering from multiple difficulties because of the tug of war between both the governments. The basic and major difference of opinion between both the governments is on the issue of lockdown and policies to combat COVID-19. Sindh government wants complete lockdown as the only viable option to slow the spread of coronavirus. While the Federal government wants partial lockdown and directs the provinces to choose their paths instead of leading and giving them direction.
Since the statement of DG ISPR looks mature and sensible concerning fight against COVID-19 in which he said that ""cooperation is more important than isolation in the fight against COVID-19"". Besides, the Supreme Court of Pakistan took a suo-motu notice regarding the measures taken by the federal government to curb the spread of coronavirus. Justice Gulzar Ahmed (Chief Justice of Pakistan) showed his resentment on the performance of the federal government to handle the deadly COVID-19. He further explained that ""there is an army of ministers and advisors in place but there is no working being done"". He further explained that corrupt people have been kept as advisors in the government.
The Chief Justice also raised the questions over the credential of the Special Assistant to Prime Minister on Health Dr Zafar Mirza. One of the biggest lacks observed in the leadership of big political parties of the country is lack of vision, commitment and will power to face and resist against difficulties, proper planning and strategy for any policy and action. This is all because of the lack of proper education and understanding of circumstances.
Furthermore, the ruling elite of Pakistan never bothers to think out of national premises rather its thinking is limited. The ruling elite's topmost priority remains on controlling the national affairs, point scoring as well as dominancy over others within the country. They never bother to consider the regional as well as global changes that severely affect the national and internal affairs because of the globalized world. Pakistan is living in the society of nations which are depending and connected where actions and policies of one state leave impacts over another one even beyond the region.
In this regard, the Federal government needs not only the cooperation and coordination of provincial governments but also other states and international regimes to fight against Coronavirus. Therefore it has to make decisions rationally via looking over the existing circumstances rather than taking decisions which become the source of resentment between the Federal and provincial governments as well as the global entities.

2020-04-17,Polarization Between Pakistan 's Federal And Sindh Governments On COVID-19 – OpEd,,"The Congressional Budget Office came out with its neweconomic projectionsand they look realistically bad to me. They show the economy declining at a 39.6 percent annual rate in the current quarter and then rebounding at a 23.5 percent rate in the third quarter and closing out the year with a 10.5 percent increase. Unemployment averages 14.0 percent in the current quarter and rises to 16.0 percent in the third quarter. It falls back to 11.7 percent in the fourth quarter, but still averages 10.1 percent in 2021.
While this looks like a pretty bad story to me, I saw comments on Twitter arguing it was too optimistic. The gist of these comments was that people will be too scared when the shutdown period ends to carry on anything like their normal life.
I don't really see that. First, as we know, there are plenty of jerks who never took the pandemic seriously. Given a green light to go shopping, get a haircut, or a tattoo, many will be quick to do so. The fact that all of these people are not going to die will cause others to follow.
But, we are making progress in learning how to limit the spread. Unfortunately, the U.S. is basically nowhere in the testing and tracing department, but that hopefully will change over the next couple of months. Also, there are many simple commonsense practices that will substantially reduce the risk.
Wearing masks in public places is an obvious one. Limiting the number of people allowed in stores and restaurants is another. Presumably ventilation also matters. This is a worldwide problem. Several European countries have already begun to reopen and others will do so soon. We should be able to learn best practices from each other.
This is not a zero/one story where there is either zero risk or an intolerable risk, the issue is one of reducing the probability of catching the virus so that more people can feel comfortable engaging in normal activities. (Improvementsin treatment will also be hugely important.) Unfortunately, Donald ""America First"" Trump is probably not interested in learning from the experiences in other countries, but the best money forward thinking governors will ever spend will be carefully monitoring the successes and failures in re-openings elsewhere and finding ways to adopt the successes here. Until we have a vaccine we will not be completely safe, but there is enormous room for reducing risks and that should be the top priority for people in policy positions.

2020-04-29,On The Recovery From The COVID-19 Shutdown – OpEd,,"Effective communication is an essential life skill in all aspects of our lives. During this past year, COVID-19 has put a strain on the ways we ordinarily communicate. Many parents are working at home with their kids at home rather than sitting in a classroom. Lots of adjustments had to be made quickly and under duress.
I wasn't surprised to hear the questions my clients were asking about how to deal with their children during this intense time.
 From my perspective, although this year has been very stressful, it also has been a year of opportunity. After all, maintaining and/or learning healthy communication skills is a valuable goal for parents.
One parent asked ""How do I communicate better with my three-year-old?"" Others needed help with communicating with teenage children.
I believe that whether you are parenting a toddler, an older child or a teenager, good communication is a core part of good parenting. Building mutual respect during the pandemic will have lasting positive effects during the pandemic and after it is over.
When it comes to parent-child communication, there is no one size that fits all. Parents are individuals who have their unique personalities, emotional histories and individual temperaments. Communication styles vary as well. Nevertheless, the social science literature does highlight certain communication tips that can help parents communicate effectively.
1. Connect before you express. Parent-child communication is more effective when a parent tries first to get the child to make eye contact. Therefore, a parent should first ask the child to look at him/her or even look into his/her eyes and only then say something.
 cnxps.cmd.push(function () { cnxps({ playerId: '36af7c51-0caf-4741-9824-2c941fc6c17b' }).render('4c4d856e0e6f4e3d808bbc1715e132f6'); });if(window.location.pathname.indexOf(""647856"") != -1) {console.log(""hedva connatix"");document.getElementsByClassName(""divConnatix"")[0].style.display =""none""}
2. Don't use physical punishment. The parent who regularly resorts to physical punishment can be guaranteed of one thing: raising a child who will most likely use the same approach with others, siblings, peers, or even toward parents. Granted, some kids are more challenging and they may make you angry, but clearly, physical punishment is not effective in the short and long run.
Parents who have anger management problems may need to seek out therapy to learn how to manage their anger.
3. Begin your directives with ""I want."" Instead of ""Get down,"" say ""I want you to get down."" Instead of ""Let Rivka have a turn,"" say ""I want you to let Rivka have a turn now."" This works well with children who want to please but don't like being ordered. By saying ""I want,"" you give a reason for compliance rather than just an order.
4. Keep it simple and clear. Whenever possible, don't beat around the bush when you have something important to convey to your child. Be clear and concise. Both younger children and teenagers appreciate their parent's frankness and asking direct questions such as ""Where are you going?"" and agreeing on a time to be home.
5. Be aware of your tone of voice. Very often it's not what people say, but how they say it, that makes the difference. Like adults, children are more likely to be attentive if spoken to in a respectful way. Don't ignore your kids' sensitivities to your verbal delivery.
6. Don't embarrass your children. In the heat of the moment, many parents have been guilty of calling their kids out in front of relatives or friends. The result can lead to resentment and embarrassment. This is especially true for a teenager who may feel downright humiliated when an angry parent calls him/her out in front of friends.
7. Give choices. As a general rule, everyone likes some control, even your kids. So, give choices whenever possible, such as ""Do you want to put on your pajamas or brush your teeth first?""
8. Talk your child down. The louder your child yells, the softer you respond. Let your child ventilate while you interject timely comments: ""I understand"" or ""Can I help?"" Sometimes just having a caring listener available will wind down the tantrum. If you descend to his level, you have two tantrums to deal with. Be the adult for him/her.
9. Give advance notice. ""We are leaving soon. Say bye-bye to the toys, bye-bye to the girls....""
10. Let your child know that you are interested in his day. One of the ways a parent can show a child that he/she really cares is to ask the child about how his/her day was. You'd be surprised to hear how much good communication can come out this simple question. Too often, busy parents, struggling with their own stress, overlook the mood status of their children.
11. Advice for parent-teenager communication. Remember, teens are forming both emotional and physical identities and independence, so be sensitive to disagreements and respect their boundaries. Nevertheless, be clear and direct about what you believe is an appropriate behavioral standard.
12. Shared activities with children. Kids are the most open for quality communication when you play a sport or a game with them. Pick any activity your child likes, such as soccer, basketball, Lego, or playing with dolls.
13. Tell your children that you love them. Regardless of the child's age, they never get tired of hearing this.
Remember, raising children is a gift and can be one of the most rewarding things you will ever do in your life.
Good communication with your children is a goal that is worth your daily attention. It has lasting positive benefit for both parent and child. 

2022-01-16,"SEN. JOHNSON TO HOLD PANEL DISCUSSION, COVID-19: A SECOND OPINION",,"Covid-19 as of May 2, 2020 has affected over 3,398,550 including about 239,448 deaths and over 1,080,101 recovered cases. The aforementioned figures in here almost 2,079,001 active cases (95%) in which 51,355 are in critical conditions (worldometers, 2020). The present situation of the living planet has turned out from endemic to pandemic.
The acute crises generated by Corona virus throughout the world is beyond our imagination. The exclusive measures to meet out the present crises in the present situation is none other than avoidance of human contacts and sanitizing the exposed part of the body, specially till the virus is totally exterminated. Thus, the fundamental and the common saying, ""prevention is better than cure"" has to be materialized.
The heart-soothing news is that over 1,319,549 cases have been closed and approximately 2,027,569 patients (98%) have suffered mild attack of the deadly disease (ibid). WHO has recorded 2,24,172 confirmed deaths and 31,75,207 confirmed cases as on 02 May 2020 (WHO, 2020). Similar data have been shared by Johns Hopkins University (Univeristy, 2020). In fact, it can be presumed that the statistical figures given by the government and mass media may vary on account of the internal policy frame work of their operational dynamics.
Covid-19 is a pandemic disease and there is no doubt that people across the globe are getting infected regularly and the cases of infections and deaths are increasing by galloping pace. The world is worried and concerned about health and well-being of people and humans as a race. It has nothing to do with religion, caste, creed or colour. The past, pandemic cases of Spanish flu of 1918 or that of Hong Kong flu of 1968 or Ebola virus of 2013-16 or Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome or Middle East Respiratory Syndrome had no differentiation other than infection that lead to deaths of millions of innocent human beings. The pandemic affected and brutally killed humans across the planet. Any one who was affected, had low immunity, could not pull through and succumbed to the disease.
The entire world today is obsessed with identifying and treating patients affected by the Corona virus. Governments of different countries are burning midnight oil to find ways and means to prevent the wide spread infection from one corner to other parts of their country. They have closed borders to prevent the virus transcending the political boundaries. US and Canada, despite being very good neighbours, have closed down borders. Almost all countries have banned flights from/to their countries. Why is all this fuss?? Simply to safe guard people from getting infected and to prevent further casualties. It is well known fact that the spread of disease is in exponential terms and multiplies at unimaginable speed. Hence, we should not only be serious and cautious but also abide by the rules and orders of the government.
However, a disturbing trend has been noticed this time in certain parts of the world primarily in Muslim dominated countries (smith, 2020). It appears that they are afraid of nothing and sincere prayers will save the population from this deadly disease. Muslim clerics have conveyed openly that the faith in The Prophet is supreme and He will save everyone.
Malaysia reported mass gathering and prayers of almost 16000 people from 27 February to 01 March 2020 (Sukumaran, 2020) on the outskirts of Kuala Lumpur at Sri Petaling mosque. Known to have been organized by Tablighi Jamaat, an old missionary cult, their leaders asked people to go back to days of Mohmmed Prophet, live together, pray together and share common platform for Vaju (personal cleaning before prayers). People stayed in tents, and prayed together at the mosque. Large number of foreign travelers had participated in the prayers and have carried the virus at home and their localities.Bangladesh reported that influential religious leaders called for community prayers on 19 March 2020 at Raipur in Lakshmipur district that was attended by 1000 people. BBC Bengali correspondent Akbar Hossain reported the figures as 30,000 and that there was no permission taken from the authorities (Hosain, 2020). The event was based on the fact that the people post these prayers will be healed from deadly Corona virus.Indonesia reported that same cult 'Tablighi Jamaat' which planned another religious prayer over three days, 19-22 March at Gowa in province of South Sulawesi (News, 2020). Intervention by the authorities led to cancellation of the event but by then over 10,000 people across the world had gathered in the town.India reported mass gathering for prayers on 20 March 2020 (Friday prayers) in Mumbai, Kolkata, Patna, New Delhi, Sri Nagar, Ahmedabad (News18, 2020) even while the Prime Minister announced self-initiated curfew. Claims of sanitization and hygienic conditions are made but how far do these fructify is a matter of personal and social sensitivity. The short clips, videos, photos and messages of various types generate fear in the common masses about orthodox character of rigid and rudimentary perspective of illogical and unscientific band of people from certain section of society. The suitable example that can be quoted is the protest at Shaheen Bagh in New Delhi.
On the contrary, there are Muslim countries that have banned central prayer together at any mosque. Turkey is one of the leading countries. Mr Ali Erbas, Head of Religious affairs of Turkey has very strongly conveyed that Islam does not permit putting human life in danger. All prayers in congregations have been suspended. Other countries that have now banned central prayers are Lebanon, Iraq, Egypt and Jordan.
There is partial ban on congregation and central prayers at mosques in Saudi Arabia (less prayers in Macca, Medina mosques), Iran, Sudan, Nigeria, Rwanda, Kenya and Kuwait. Various flights have been banned and attempts are made by some of these countries to prevent importing the virus through immigration. Yet there are countries like Pakistan, Afghanistan, Bangladesh and some LDC countries that are yet to initiate an effective action to arrest the trend. Indonesia, the largest Muslim dominated country in the world has not put any ban on central prayers so far. Thus, it has increased the risk of infection among all the devotees. People are free to offer namaaz at Istiqlal Mosque in Jakarta. The disease is known been originated from Wuhan in China and has engulfed 212 countries. Major countries that have suffered deaths are China, Italy, Spain and majority of Europe and Middle East. However, infections from Muslim countries' mass prayers are becoming visible now. Malaysia has 6002 full blown cases with 102 deaths. Cases of Indonesia have also crossed 10000 mark. Impact of slow or no action by some of these Muslim countries is likely to affect the humanity drastically. Pakistan is a country of over 200 million Muslims have Muslim clerics like Sabir Durrani, Head of Islamic lobby and Mirza Shahzad Akbar, Special assistance to Prime Minister Imran Khan have been advocating central prayers, emotional and religious connect of the people (Shahjad, 2020).
Issue at large is survival of humanity and not of a religion. The same very countries on finding out that the cases of Corona virus are spreading withing their country or being imported or exported are realizing the gravity of situation. One can have the choice of life only if humanity lives through this pandemic. Cases of deaths are spiraling out of proportion and countries are fighting tooth and nail to control the disease. Many countries have started banning congregation and even lockdown to prevent further spread of the virus. Malaysia has now ordered complete lockdown in the country. But, the damage been done already. Within couple of days, the impact will be visible at global level. One has to wait and see the impact in days to come.
Impact on India
India is sitting on the edge of explosion of the pandemic. The way congregation has taken place, even a fraction of infection in each of these congregations is sure to set the infectious ball rolling. More so, there have been cases of Indians returning home from the Middle East and South East Asian countries. Sheer ignorance of the magnanimity of the devastation is likely to play havoc in the masses. Some irresponsible behaviours like the common mass prayers, washing hands with the same water, inadequate hygienic conditions and simple thought of severity of the deadly disease appears missing at many places. When some of these carriers of Covid-19 escape from hospitals or hide the disease coupled with lack of adequate testing facilities, is likely to further accentuate the deteriorating condition. Indians, irrespective of religion have to take personal responsibility of ensuring all possible preventive measures and the government has to be proactive in its approach to contain the virus in Stage 2 itself. Aggravation of the situation to stage 3 is a sign of danger that India has to avoid at all costs.
Fortunately for India, extreme sensitivity shown by the government in handling the situation should help out. Janta-curfew to locking down of four states and 75 districts are steps in right direction. Provisioning of testing equipment and creating new quarantine facilities are need of the hour. As the lockdown encompasses greater swathes, the time bomb of Covid – 19 ticks; the world waits with bated breath.
Stay Home, Pray at Home is the answer to safety of humanity in times of Covid-19.

2020-05-03,Religious Freedom In Times Of COVID-19 – OpEd,,"The Advanced Countries Made The Corona Virus Vac-cine. But Their Inhabitants Refuse To Take It. It Causes Riots. The Vaccine Is Sent To The Poor Countries. Their Inhabitants Queue Up To Take It.
To Encourage Their People To Get Vaccinated, America Gives $100 To Anyone Who Takes It. I Took It And Received The $100-Akimbo Debit Card.
When You Get Vaccinated, You Do Not Go Home. You Are Taken Into A Room Where You Are Observed For 15 Minutes For Any Eventualities. After 15 Minutes, Your Name Is Called And Asked: ""How Do You Feel?""
If You Don't Get Any Reaction, You Are Given A Backpack That Contains Virus-Related Material Like Hand Sanitizers, Sanitizer Gel Packs, Nose Masks, Antibacterial Wipes, Gloves, A Tee-Shirt, And A Cup. You Are Then Discharged.
On The Other Hand, If You Get Any Reaction, You Are Treated On The Spot.
One Of The Main Reasons People In The Advanced Countries Refuse To Take The Vaccine Is The Hasty Nature In Which It Was Prepared. They Contend That The COVID-19 Vaccine Are Not Safe Because They Were Made Too Quickly.
But The Government Explains That The Vaccine Went Through Clinical Trials And Safety Reviews, Saying That Over 40,000 People Participated In The Pfizer Vaccine Clinical Trials.
However, The Question Remains: Why Are Their Own People Refusing It, If Was So Worthy?
Being Skeptical, I Have Kept My Ears To The Ground Listening To People Who Have Taken The Vaccination. I Heard About People Who Have Taken It And Developed Swollen Painful Arms And Had Been Taken To Valley View Hospital.
Following Up On The Rumour, I Went To The Hospital. Only One Per-son Had Been There With A Swollen Arm, And Nothing More.
Of Course, There Are Side-Effects. The Most Common Of Them Are Headache, Fatigue, Pain Around The Injection Area, Muscle Or Joint Pains.
In Ghana, Should You Experience Any Of The Side-Effects, You Take It Home. That Is Where The Problem Is!
The Person Who Went To Valley View Hospital, After The Vacci-nation, Had To Deal With It On His Own. And That Is Scary.

2021-12-21,Why Are People Refusing to Take the Covid-19 Jab [opinion],,"Two and a half months after the first batch of COVID-19 vaccines landed in Thailand, over 1.5 million people across the country have already been vaccinated. That covered about 1% of the population.
Since the supplies are strictly limited, the priority is given to frontline healthcare workers and those who have high risk exposure first.
The country has been hit hard with the pandemic since early last year, leaving the economy as well as the people's well-being and day-to-day lives greatly impacted.
To control the situation and bring back normalcy, the Thai government plans to vaccinate 70% of the population or roughly 50 million people by the end of the year.
Vaccine registration has been open for the vulnerable groups of people namely those who aged 60 and above and those with some specific chronic diseases in the past week on May 1 while the registration for the general public aging between 18 to 59 will be opened again in the next two months.
It comes just at the right time as now Thailand may need protection the most since the number of infections hitting roughly 2,000 every day in the past weeks after the Songkran holidays which saw people travelling between provinces, visiting their family.
But at the same time reports keep emerging of people getting undesirable effects after getting the jabs while preliminary results show the vaccines used in the country may not be as effective, with the efficacy rate around 50%.

2021-05-10,Thailand : Public Opinion on COVID-19 Inoculation in Thailand,,"Humans are Confined to four walls, life is Stalled and love is Paused . Since the inception of Human life the Sensation of touch is a natural and Continuing set of emotions. The outbreak of a global Pandemic has challenged the idea of companionship . It has set forth the debate that Whether  a Human relationship survive will or not Survive without having the way of expression of feeling i.e.touch. In my opinion the idea of companionship has two aspects one that the Companions are emotionally strong to deal with the Physical distance or the relationship would start dying. The Crisis of Corona virus has challenged the Psychological barriers of Human mind. Mind that used to be creative, insightful, and loving are gradually transforming into the the Flickering emotions. As an author of this article I must say after a bad relationship and then after  deserted relationship just before the nationwide lockdown In the country making things worse for me. It's so hard that sometimes I went to sub-conscious state without having any sense in the dark nights. Life is dark so does Humans. The idea of Human relationship is based on the Premise of selfishness mutual benefits and the selective approach of imminence.
What's left to Humanity?
This pandemic has created an environment of uncertainty among the people across the country. While we are focusing on maintain our physical health but somewhere we are ignoring the fact that this situation is affecting our mental health too. People are ignoring the need of a collective cooperation and the organised support. Humanity is not the legacy which can be continued it's a spirit of Human Survival. The fight against COVID-19 must be fought by all means necessary - scientific, economic, social, security and religious. But we should not lose sight of the fact that this is not about being rich or poor, developed or developing, but about being wise, compassionate and humane.  This crisis has realised that the we are not the master of life, only Death is the master of life. The death of the two legendry Cinema stars in India Irrfan Khan and Rishi Kapoor endorses the Shakespeare's claims that Life is a scaffold and the Humans have limited time to act till the curtain falls. We need to understand that Human emotions and relationship should be designed to help the Survival of value of Humanity.
Combating Challenge and Conclusions
As some of the claims coming out in the de - globalisation of world as a solution to solve the Humanity crisis as their line of argument is based in the idea that Globalisation is the reson of this crisis. My question is what about Individual role? . The Same Individuality was a form of the tribe idea of Globalisation.  The challenge of humanity lies on the both the Government and Individual level , the autocratic tendencies are rising , I have a fear that the In Post - Covid era and I am making this claim on the basis of my closed observation of People in India that there would be depreciation of democratic values and creation of tamed Citizens, which would be thinking in Parallel with the government,and there would be a creation of Orwellian state. On the Individual front People will be hesitate to socialise, the relationship would be dead ,there would be ongoing battle between emotions and Survival. The best anathema to this crisis is the dialogue and Communication, Dialogue between Government and the Citizens on the Institutional front and Communication amongst the Individuals on the Personal front. A country like India and its Citizens should adopt, the Popular Double engine Slogan of Incumbent Political Party can be failed but this can't. The life should start from Balcony but conclude to the Heart so that Humanity can brighten us like Sun.
This article is dedicated to Bhawna Sharma, who are helping in combating with the emotional crisis.

2020-05-03,From Balcony To Heart: Challenging Basic In Tuition Of Life In The Time Of COVID-19 – OpEd,,"""What do I need to do (or know) as a person with Sickle cell disease?"" The enquirer is health care student. In response I came across nice piece written by Nitin et al published in the Pan African Medical Journal (Vol 36, May -Aug 2020). The World Health Organization (WHO) has identified sickle cell disease (SCD) as a major concern of public health significance. It has been estimated that around 5% of the global population carry Sickle Cell Trait genes. About two-thirds of the sickle cell disease patients of the global burden reside in sub-Saharan Africa. COVID-19 Pandemic caused by Corona virus 2 (SARS COV2) is having a devastating effect on socioeconomic and health indicators in counties worldwide. The additional financial burden of supporting health care management system in tackling COVID-19 impact at the same time preventing mortality rate of COVID-19 deaths is a matter of great concern to all.
The pathogenesis of the sickle cell disease is attributed to the polymerization of the deoxygenated haemoglobin S(HbS). The polymerization leads to alteration in the normal biconcave shape of the red blood cells making them rigid and more prone for intravascular haemolysis. As a consequence of repeated hypoxia driven polymerization of HbS there is development of cyclic cascade leading to blood cell adhesion, vaso-occlusive crisis and ischaemic reperfusion injury. SCD patients may develop complications such as Acute Chest Syndrome, pulmonary embolism and stroke
About two thirds of new borns born with SCD worldwide are found in sub-Saharan Africa. The sickle cell gene HbSS is commonly identified in Africa in SCD while HbSC and HbS/ beta+thalassemia has been observed in West Africa. SCD had led to the death of about 50-90% of the affected as the disease remained undiagnosed during the childhood. The various studies done in Africa were found that SCD patients have higher mortality rates. In Ghana-the programme to enhance health care for sickle cell disease is a big relief.
The development of knowledge of understanding the pathology and management protocol of SCD has been helpful in management of the disease. The presence of malaria, undernutrition and other infectious diseases also contribute towards mortality rate in Africa. Of late it has been seen that because of the devoted and dedicated health care services provided by the health personnel the mortality rates are declining and this life-threatening disease of children is now progressing to chronic disease of the adult.
It has been observed that pulmonary functions are decreased in SCD. Lung functions are compromised in patients of sickle cell disease and Sickle Cell Trait (SCT). Repeated chest infections in SCD and SCT lead to alteration in geometry of lung parenchyma and physical properties of elastic and collagen fibres thus decreasing pulmonary function parameters such as Forced Vital Capacity, Forced Expiratory Volume and Forced Expiratory Volume 1%. Moreover the pulmonary vasculature is highly sensitive to hypoxia (absence of enough oxygen) driven micro-occlusion of pulmonary vasculature which along with cell adhesive changes may cause pulmonary hypertension and further compromise lung functions]. Persons with SCD have an increased susceptibility to infection. The impaired leucocyte function and humoral and cell-mediated immunity loss have been reported to account for the immunocompromised state in patients with sickle cell disease. The SCD patients being immune compromised are more prone for recurrent chest infections. The major cause of mortality in patients of SCD is acute chest syndrome, pneumonia and acute respiratory distress syndrome.
COVID-19 is the acronym for corona virus disease 19 and has been termed as SARS-COV-2 by International Committee of Taxonomy on Virus (ICTV). The common clinical manifestations observed in patients of sickle cell disease include cough, fever, shortness of breath, loss of smell perception and loss of taste sensation. Most of the patients of COVID-19 may have a mild course of disease while few may develop severe clinical manifestations. The clinical manifestation of severity in COVID-19 patient includes Acute Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS), Pneumonia, Multiple Organ Failure, Septic Shock and Sepsis. The severity of pneumonia manifests with dyspnoea (difficulty or laboured breathing) and tachypnoea (abnormally rapid breathing)
COVID-19 infection can worsen the pulmonary manifestation in SCD patients especially in those having pulmonary complications such as Acute Chest Syndrome, Pulmonary Hypertension and ARDS. COVID-19 infections in SCD can also increase morbidity and mortality risk in these patients.
The main cause of concern in patients of SCD is that these patients are immunocompromised and may suffer from both acute and chronic complications which require hospitalization and close contact with the medical system. There is overlap in clinical manifestations of fever and lung disease in COVID-19 and SCD. The increased complications will amplify health care utilization-e diagnostic, management and logistic challenges. In view of the above facts it is necessary for health care workers to educate SCD patient registered in their areas regarding care and precautions to be taken during COVID-19 pandemic to prevent getting affected with COVID-19 infection. Although the education applies to everyone, there should be more emphasis for persons with SCD.
All persons with SCD need to be educated regarding COVID-19 signs, symptoms and mode of spread. They should be explained regarding the increased risk of contracting COVID-19 infections in them due to their immunocompromised state. All patients of SCD should be advised to strictly adhere to social distancing, isolation polices, use of face mask, and frequent hand washing with soap to prevent COVID-19 infections. They should keep adequate medication of SCD such as analgesic and antipyretic drugs, hydroxyurea. They can be advised regarding use of clinical thermometer at home as fever is common sign in SCD patient and thereby these persons can take appropriate precautions and medication after seeking telephonic consultation with their health care providers. They can use pharmacy home delivery services in case they require medication during emergency situations.
Until then regularly/daily consume polyphenol-rich cocoa. It is been useful for persons with SCD.

2020-10-09,"Uzbekistan , Turkmenistan in talks to develop co-op amid COVID-19",,"When it comes to the field of ethical behavior, perhaps one of the greatest dangers as humans is that we look at things in a very binary manner. We are often prone to approaching a particular behavioral challenge from an all-or-nothing viewpoint. We are either completely prepared to adopt a specific mode of behavior or just throw in the towel and reject all sorts of recommendations and objectively sound advice.
This behavioral quandary is very reflective of where we find ourselves as a society today. It is leading to unprecedented levels of public healthcare confusion, at a time when many of us thought things couldn't get any more confusing.
In the face of an increasingly disturbing wave of widespread sickness, people are falling prone to that natural inclination to ignore government recommendations. Defined by a sense of chaos and uncertainty in what they are being asked to do, people sense that the authorities aren't thinking strategically. In places where there is such a leadership vacuum, people respond by thinking that they need to look out first and foremost for their own interests if there are no clear answers as to what is best for all.

From the ethical perspective, this is a wholly unviable and certainly dangerous situation for a society to be. From the perspective of the government, operating without any clear strategy and sending a message that the public needs to figure it out on their own is certainly misguided and is unlikely to stop the spread of the virus.
However, an individual has no right to act unilaterally. A pandemic is by definition a crisis where individual actions impact on the welfare of the collective. People line up in a queue at the entrance of a COVID-19 rapid antigen Magen David Adom testing center in Jerusalem on January 03, 2022. (credit: OLIVIER FITOUSSI/FLASH90)
The current reality is that we are living in what can only be described as the COVID-19 jungle.
We awake nearly each morning to what feels like a new series of directives and guidelines, some of which stand in direct contrast to what we were told the day before. We are told that the very testing systems that are meant to protect us are questionable at best and completely useless at worst. And even the most trusting of us recognize that complete faith in the system is naive and misguided.
Amid it all is a sizable and seemingly expanding demographic that completely rejects healthcare recommendations and guidelines to the point of anarchy.
 We are in a situation where confusion and doubt are natural reactions.
As teachers, parents or just members of an interconnected human race, we have a personal responsibility to find a way to embrace sound and ethical practices that will guide us through this chaos.
The moral response has to be that we avoid the compulsion to think to the extremes.
As confused as we justifiably might feel and as angry as we might be at the authorities for fueling confusion, we cannot be absolved of our personal and communal responsibilities. If we feel sick and worry that we might infect others, we must stay home. We cannot allow ourselves to be swayed by this environment of discontent and ignore the continued importance of vaccination. The rationale of social distancing remains as sound as ever and we should avoid crowded spaces as much as possible.
After nearly two years into this crisis, the one value we must all remind ourselves of is humility. There are no complete answers and we can only do our own small parts. But those small parts are to first and foremost follow the ethical and moral path that stresses that what we do will have a negative impact on others. Whatever chaos reigns outside our doors, the tiny virus that may lie within us continues to have the potential to cause serious disease or worse to ourselves and others.
The onus of responsibility falls just as much so, if not to a far greater extent, than on our leaders and governments. Remain humble in knowing that you don't have all the answers, but acknowledge that your power doesn't entitle you to disturb and destroy lives and livelihoods in pursuit of a solution to this pandemic.
The jungle is a dark and often inhospitable place. Finding our way out demands that we act responsibly and chart a course that will benefit everyone.

2022-01-12,How to navigate the COVID-19 'jungle' - opinion,,"More than 80 wealthy individuals arepetitioning for higher taxes on the richto help pay for the billions in new government programs made necessary by the Covid-19 pandemic. This is petition is disingenuous at best.
If the wealthy want to pay more to help fight COVID-19, they can choose to do so themselves. They don't need government to force them.
Many wealthy individuals already havepledged to devote more than half their wealthto charitable activities, without government force. What this petition actually asks is that government tax other people, who don't share the values of the petitioners.
It's their money to allocate as they want. If they want to allocate it to others, that's their choice, although as I document in my bookWriting Off Ideas: Taxation, Foundations, and Philanthropy in America, sometimes the results are not as desirable as the intentions.
In my book, I note that Henry Ford was notoriously uncharitable during his lifetime, saying that the best thing he could do with his money was to reinvest it in the Ford Motor Company to give people good jobs and affordable automobiles. Was he wrong? Regardless, it was his money and his choice to make.
There are two other troubling aspects to this petition. One is the presumption that the best way to fight the virus pandemic is to give the government more money. On the contrary, governments may not be the best organizations to fight diseases. Moreover, COVID-19, while raging right now, is a temporary problem and there are already aggressive initiatives underway to quickly develop a vaccine. It is unlikely at this point that sending more money to government will hasten the end to the pandemic.
A second issue—the most disingenuous part—is that the petition calls for a permanent increase in taxes to address a temporary problem. The petitioners are using the current pandemic as a cover to further their pro-government agenda.
Their real motive has nothing to do with addressing the pandemic, and everything to do with raising taxes to make government a bigger part of your life. If they succeed, the costs will fall not only on rich taxpayers but on everyone, because our liberty will be a bit more compromised.

- The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency issued a positive opinion to recommend the conditional marketing authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (also known as BNT162b2), for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in individuals 16 years of age and older, US-based biopharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and German biotechnology company BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX) said.

The purpose of a CMA is to allow for medicinal products to be authorized on a conditional basis for seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases or for use in emergency situations in response to public health threats recognized either by the World Health Organization or the European Union.

The CHMP advisors based their positive opinion on the scientific evidence supporting the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, including data from a Phase 3 clinical study announced last month and published in The New England Journal of Medicine on December 10, 2020. 

The European Commission will review the CHMP recommendation and is expected to make a final decision on the conditional marketing authorization in the near future. If the EC grants the CMA, the decision will be immediately applicable to all 27 EU member states.

To date, the vaccine has been authorized or approved for emergency use in more than 15 countries. Regulatory reviews are underway in several countries, with more submissions anticipated.

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has not been approved or licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration, but has been authorized for emergency use by FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for use in individuals 16 years of age and older. 

The emergency use of this product is only authorized for the duration of the declaration that circumstances exist justifying the authorization of emergency use of the medical product under Section 564 (b) (1) of the FD and C Act unless the declaration is terminated or authorization revoked sooner. 

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine is authorized for use under an Emergency Use Authorization for active immunization to prevent coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in individuals 16 years of age and older.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (95%); VACCINES (95%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (92%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (90%); CLINICAL TRIALS (89%); CORONAVIRUSES (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); RESPIRATORY DISORDERS & INJURIES (89%); SARS (89%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (89%); VIRUSES (89%); EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS & BODIES (78%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (78%); APPROVALS (77%); EUROPEAN UNION (77%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (77%); BIOTECHNOLOGY INDUSTRY (76%); MEDICAL RESEARCH (75%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (73%); BIOTECHNOLOGY & GENETIC SCIENCE (73%); RESEARCH REPORTS (73%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (73%); REGULATORY ACTIONS (72%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (67%)

2020-12-21,"Pfizer, BioNTech Receive CHMP Positive Opinion for their COVID-19 Vaccine",,"We reported in yesterday's issue of the Ghanaian Times an appeal to the government to reconsider the decision not to open all streams of schools in the country.
The appeal, which was made by the Executive Director of Child Rights International (CRI), Mr Bright Appiah, said allowing second-year students in both junior and senior high schools to resume classes, while the rest stayed at home had worse repercussions for children.
In a statement issued in Accra in apparent response to the government's decision not to reopen basic schools due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Mr Appiah said the social structure that existed among families, the society and the entire nation had not changed to accommodate and provide the needed tuition for children at home.
Additionally, he explained that the corporate environment of the country had not adjusted its time lines to allow families to spend more time with their children at home.
The statement further argued that the media, especially television and social media did not have adequate educational programmes to aid children's academic growth at home.
""The government, since March 16, closed all schools due to COVID-19 spread in the country but had since reopened tertiary institutions, senior and junior high schools,"" it said.
However, the government has stated categorically that those basic schools would remain closed until further notice.
The decision of the government, we believe, is purely based on science and data and so just as it has been able to do for other segments of the educational ladder, the government would reopen the schools when the time is due.
Do not forget, in July, pre-tertiary teacher unions in Ghana held a press conference in Accra and called on the government to shut down schools due to COVID-19 spread in the schools a few weeks after reopening.
According to the teacher unions then, measures instituted by the authorities to ensure safety of both staff and students had not been implemented to prevent the spread of the disease.
The Ghanaian Times believes that information provided by the teacher unions is very useful and if any consideration is to be made for the reopening of the schools, these are some of the pieces of information which should be taken into account.
We think the government must consider the suggestion from CRI whilst it considers all the necessary protocols before reopening the schools.
We agree with CRI that keeping the schools closed may affect the children's education in many ways but as we know it now, we are not in normal times and COVID-19 appears to have come to stay and may be with us for a long time.
It is, therefore, in our interest and that of our children to tread cautiously while instituting measures that would prevent the spread of COVID-19 when the schools reopen.
Do not forget the children must be alive to attend school.","CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS & TEENS (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); SCHOOL CLOSINGS (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (89%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (89%); CHILDREN'S RIGHTS (78%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); EDUCATION & TRAINING (78%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (78%); PRESS CONFERENCES (78%); SAFETY (77%); EPIDEMICS (73%); HIGH SCHOOLS (73%); MIDDLE & JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOLS (73%); PANDEMICS (73%); EXECUTIVES (72%); TEACHER UNIONS (68%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (50%); Ghana (%); Coronavirus (%); Education (%)

2020-09-08,Policy On Reopening of Basic Schools Amid Covid-19 [opinion],,"It's probably safe to say that of all the losses suffered in the months since the coronavirus pandemic hit, one of the greatest, if not the greatest, has been the loss of ceremony.                 
                   I know you've felt it, too.                 
                   Social distancing has meant that traditional celebrations like proms, birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, weddings, and funerals have all had to be done in isolation - if at all.                 
                   It's been worse than heartbreaking.                 
                   I felt it months ago when the Rev. Herman Cain passed. I felt it when my niece Yanna had to forgo her senior prom. And I felt it more recently when Texas friends Percy and Melanie Rogers died within days of each other.                 
Wall of hearts sees COVID-19 deaths as loved ones, not numbers
                   Death upon death followed by heartbreak upon heartbreak.                 
                   Until now, I hadn't given much thought to how important such rituals are to the circle of life. They were just things we did. To mark time. Because we enjoyed them. Because we could.                 
                   Deborah J. Cohan, an associate professor of sociology at the University of South Carolina-Beaufort, put it this way.                 
                   ""Rituals and ceremonies are grounding, reassuring, and they are something to count on,"" she said. ""They invite us to slow down and relish in the moment. They anchor us, and they often feel trustworthy when everything around us feels chaotic.""

                   I realize now how much we need them to comfort us, to be able to express our shared values, show our love and support, to build and nurture community.                 
                   And maybe that's the whole point or rather the lesson of COVID-19. Tomorrow isn't promised to any of us, so nothing should be taken for granted. Not life, not limb and certainly not our loved ones.                 
                   For me, I think the most difficult part of all this is realizing that much of the loss we've felt the past eight or so months is the result of our own selfishness.                 
                   If we just could've put aside our need to exercise our freedoms, how different might things have turned out, how many loved ones might have been saved, how many jobs might have been rescued, how much pain might have been avoided?                 
There are no ifs, ands or buts: Not wearing a mask is pure selfishness
                   Back in March, when we shut down, I looked forward to returning to my routine. When we first left the office, it was to be for only a few months. Same with worship services at my beloved Antioch Baptist Church North.                 
                   That didn't happen. Too many of us refused to wear masks, to practice social distancing. Any progress we made to slow the spread of the virus was quickly reversed. Georgia became a red zone once more.
                   Believing God was still in control, I looked for hope wherever I could find it - in the virtual team meetings with colleagues, in Zoom birthday parties and virtual church. Jimmy and I, our daughters and extended family had managed to remain healthy.                 
                   In just a few short weeks, 2020 will turn into 2021 and now all I can think of is what that might look like. How will it feel? Will it bring with it the same excitement a new start always brings? Or will I just feel dread, the kind you feel when you know something, someone is suddenly missing from your life?                 
                   I know already church will be both exhilarating and grief-stricken. It will be thrilling because I will be reunited with so many I love. Eva Manning and her daughter LaWanda. Fellow sopranos Vivian Edwards and Bennie McDonald and Bettye Jo Cooke. And many others. It'll also be hard because Herman Cain won't be there. Ms. Rosa Jean Tomlinson won't, nor will dozens of others.                 
                   COVID didn't claim all of them, but it sure feels like it.                 
                   As I said, death upon death. Heartbreak upon heartbreak.                 
                   You've felt it, too.                 
                   The only thing worse than the heartbreak has been the partisan bickering.                 
                   Even as COVID-19 continues to claim more of us, there are those who still refuse not only to believe the virus is real, they refuse to wear a mask to protect themselves.                 
                   Here's the sad part. Until they do, until we are able to at least agree that we're in this together, life as we knew it will likely remain a thing of the past.                 
                   So too will the rituals and ceremonies that make it worthwhile.                 
                   Cohan told me ceremonies help us mark time and the passage of time.                 
                   ""One reason that time has felt elusive to people during this pandemic is likely because of the lack of these events that celebrate and honor life and give it meaning and memory,"" she said. ""We often have pictures and memories created from ceremonies and these further serve to commemorate experiences.""                 
                   I don't have nearly as many pictures from 2020 as I've had from past years.                 
                   It is my hope that next year will be different.

2020-12-15,OPINION: COVID-19′s other unnamed victim - ceremony,,"Peter Ben Embarek, the head of the World Health Organization's (WHO) last mission to Wuhan, is now saying that COVID-19 could have been caused by a lab accident.
""A lab employee infected in the field while collecting samples in a bat cave—such a scenario belongs both as a lab-leak hypothesis and as our first hypothesis of direct infection from bat to human,"" he told Danish state-owned television station TV2 in a documentary that aired last Thursday. ""We've seen that hypothesis as a likely hypothesis.""
Now he tells us. Embarek sang a very different tune in an interview with Science in February. More important, his mission's final report listed a lab leak as ""an extremely unlikely pathway"" and as the least probable scenario, even less likely than transmission by frozen food.
How did the report come to this startling conclusion? As Embarek explained in the Danish documentary, a Chinese colleague would allow a mention of the possibility of a lab leak ""on the condition we didn't recommend any specific studies to further that hypothesis.""
Embarek has done himself no credit by explaining the politics behind the drafting of the WHO report, clearly revealing that it was a heavily negotiated document and that China wielded an effective veto. The report, by Embarek's admission, did not state what mission members believed to be true.
He and other mission members had an obligation to state their findings—not to propagate what their Chinese interlocutors wanted them to report.
Fortunately, we do not have to rely on Embarek or the WHO. There are the Chinese people, who have already taken great risks to tell us what they have observed and what they believe.
There was, for instance, the Wuhan Eight: Li Wenliang and seven other doctors in that city who were detained beginning late December 2019 for spreading rumors, specifically, ""issuing false information on the internet regarding the seven SARS cases at the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market."" Li, an ophthalmologist, contracted the disease, apparently treating patients, and died in February of last year.
Especially fearless was Chen Qiushi and other ""citizen journalists"" who traveled to Wuhan and reported on the disease in its first days. Chen was taken into indefinite custody in early February 2020 by authorities, and others were also disappeared. Chen's gripping videos, made from a bare room, were some of the first reports to the Chinese people—and the world.
Chinese officials, eager to counter the charge that they were slow to warn, bragged that they quickly shared the underlying coronavirus genome with the public. In fact, they sat on their findings. The Wuhan Institute of Virology identified the new coronavirus and mapped its genetic sequence by January 2 of last year.
Professor Zhang Yongzhen's team at the Shanghai Public Health Clinical Centre, defying orders from higher-ups, posted the world's first genome sequence on two public platforms on January 11. The day after the posting, the Shanghai Health Commission shuttered Zhang's lab for ""rectification."" No reason was given for the action. The Level 3 facility had passed its annual inspection on January 5.
And then there is Dr. Li-Meng Yan, a virologist. While working at a WHO reference lab at the University of Hong Kong, she countered, at great personal risk, what she thought was a cover-up by the Chinese regime and the WHO. On January 19 of last year, Yan provided YouTube's LUDE Media channel with information showing there was human-to-human transmission of COVID-19, that there were no wild animal intermediate hosts and that the Wuhan seafood market was not the origin of the outbreak. She also noted that the virus could cause a global pandemic and mutate quickly.
After threats on her life, Yan left her husband and fled Hong Kong for the United States, where she has continued coronavirus research and warned the American public that China's biological research labs are connected to the Chinese military. She also has been making the case that SARS-CoV-2, the pathogen causing COVID-19, was engineered in a lab.
Yan's contentions—especially regarding the circumstances relating to release of the disease—are controversial, but no one can deny that she epitomizes bravery and self-sacrifice.
Her work has had an impact. It looks like her warnings prompted Beijing to become far more forthcoming. China's first public admission of human-to-human transmissibility came only a few hours after the posting of the LUDE Media video.
What happens next? On May 26, President Biden ordered the U.S. intelligence community to report back in 90 days on the origins of COVID-19. He does not appear particularly interested in the topic, however. After all, he spent two hours on the phone with Chinese ruler Xi Jinping in February and did not raise the subject even once.
In fact, Biden ordered the intelligence community to look into the matter only after an uproar triggered by a CNN report that his State Department spiked a similar Trump-era investigation.
Do not expect the intelligence community later this month—90 days from May 26 brings us to August 24—to come to the conclusion that SARS-CoV-2 came from a lab. Leaks suggest its report will be inconclusive.
The Chinese state can convince Biden that the origin of the disease is not important. Beijing can even intimidate the Embareks of the world and the World Health Organization, but there are brave Chinese souls willing to risk everything to tell us what they know.
And because of them, everyone will eventually find out. Beijing cannot hide the greatest crime of this century for much longer.

2021-08-16,China's People Will Tell the World the Truth About COVID-19 | Opinion,,"Jul 14, 2020( City Limits: http://www.citylimits.org Delivered by Newstex) ; Tdorante10[1] Elmhurst Hospital Center, for many weeks the local epicenter of the COVID-19 epidemic. Months after coronavirus-related deaths peaked, we now know that New York City suffered a tale of two pandemics. Perhaps the most heartbreaking example of this is the disparate health outcomes of wealthy versus low-income New Yorkers. 
Those in affluent neighborhoods benefited from well-funded local hospitals, while those in lower-income areas had to rely on woefully under-funded 'safety net' hospitals.As the New York Times detailed in a recent investigative report, some of these community hospitals experienced COVID-19 patient mortality rates three-times higher than wealthier hospitals in Manhattan. The report also cited workers at outer-borough hospitals that serve mostly patients without private insurance, who revealed sky-high nurse-to-patient ratios of 20 to one.Fully two-thirds of New Yorkers who have died so far from COVID-19 lived in zip codes where the median household income was below the city's median. In other words, where you live during the pandemic has literally meant the difference between life or death. Living in these areas doesn't only make you more susceptible to contracting the virus, it also makes you more likely to die from the virus, for myriad reasons.This is not a new problem. It is a great historical failure of New York's government that health and life expectancy are wedded to your zip code, as well as your race. Black New Yorkers live four years shorter on average than White New Yorkers.Yet, even after this unforgivable inequality has been brutally laid bare, there are no real plans for a fix. In fact, with state Medicaid and federal healthcare cuts looming, this crisis is about to worsen.That cannot happen. The most basic function of government is to keep its people safe. And so there are reforms to our health system that must be made immediately.First of all, the city and state must formalize a truly coordinated effort to evenly distribute the responsibility of treating coronavirus patients across hospitals. In March, there were bold promises from the governor and mayor that they would take a networked approach to handling patients. But that is not what happened. It seems instead that patients were largely treated where they live, whether their hospital was overwhelmed or not.Some of the problem was bureaucratic. Healthcare understandably has layers of regulations, preventing staff and patients from easily moving between hospitals. Part of it was logistical. Besides lack of coordination between local and state government, hospitals are simply not used to sharing data and systems.But now that we know the problems, there is no reason not to fix them. Without creating a unified citywide health network with special powers during a state of emergency, we are just setting ourselves up for failure when the next crisis arrives, whether it be the next wave of COVID-19 or a new public health challenge.That coordinated approach can greatly reduce inequality in healthcare overall. When the system is set up to equitably distribute poorer, uninsured patients, outcomes will improve. Each hospital must handle their fair share.We also can no longer ignore the dire financial straits of safety net hospitals. In good times, most are on fiscal life support. But many now teeter on the brink of insolvency due to the pandemic. If those hospitals close, other safety net hospitals will become even more overwhelmed and financially insecure, tipping dominoes that could bring down the entire system.Saving our safety net hospitals will take a mix of support from public and private sources. First, the state must increase revenue from surcharges on private insurance plans generated by its 20-year-old Health Care Responsibility Act to boost funding for struggling hospitals. CityViews[2] are readers' opinions, not those of City Limits. Add your voice today![3] The state can do this by adjusting the surcharges so that they are fairer, both regionally and economically. The 'covered lives' surcharge for New York City plans is more than 10 times that of Utica plans, for instance. And the surcharges should only go up for those who can afford it.Wealthier hospitals should also help. They are able to negotiate more financially beneficial rates with commercial insurers than poorer hospitals because they treat far more of their customers, creating significant cost savings and revenue. The five major Manhattan hospital systems should partner with poorer hospitals to share those savings in a pool, using their buying power to lower costs for outer-borough safety net hospitals.Of course, the best-case scenario is that the federal government provides far more funding for our patients and our hospitals. But experience has shown we can't rely on the Trump administration to bail us out. New York has largely been on its own fighting this crisis, and that is likely to continue.When COVID-19 hit with full force in March, our hospitals did not have adequate time to prepare. If a second wave comes, we will not have that same excuse.

The covid-19 pandemic has brought on a number of unexpected developments, but the most surprising among them may be the emergence of testing wastewater for diseases. 

While some cities used wastewater to track traces of polio in the 20th century[1], the pandemic has made sewage sampling a more widespread practice — with the potential to become an integral part of how society monitors health. 

According to The Economist[1], 'The first team to publish results from wastewater testing for covid-19 was based at KWR, a water-research institute in the Netherlands. Researchers discovered early in the pandemic that about half of infected people shed sars-cov-2 in their faeces.' 

A report by the Dutch researchers[2] explains that they began by testing wastewater at several cities and the Amsterdam Airport Schiphol in February, finding covid-19 virus RNA that correlated with reported covid-19 cases in the cities and the airport. 

The research team concluded 'that sewage surveillance could be a sensitive tool to monitor the circulation of the virus in the population.' 

Since then, academics in over 70 countries[3] have established improvised programs to detect traces of covid-19 in wastewater. 

These programs vary in the populations they cover, from localized hubs like universities, or entire countries like the Netherlands, where researchers were monitoring every sewage treatment plant in the country[1] by September 2020. 

Regardless of the program's size, wastewater screening remains a powerful tool[1]: 'Researchers reckon a single infectious case of covid-19 can be detected amid the waste of up to 14,000 people. Testing the effluent of an entire population is much cheaper than individually screening each resident, and can often spot cases earlier.' 

In practice[1], these statements held up: 'Wastewater analysis proved capable of spotting waves of infections one to two weeks before conventional, nasal-swab testing. Countries with lower rates of conventional testing, such as Malawi, got up to a month's notice.' 

Although wastewater data is available online[4] for many countries, their technology and infrastructure are inconsistent and underdeveloped across the numerous wastewater surveillance programs. 

'Collecting, testing and reporting procedures must be standardized,' The Economist urges[1],  
to allow comparisons between different places. Many existing procedures are strikingly low-tech. Tampons are often used as a tool to soak up water for testing, for example.' 

While covid-19 surveillance is the primary function of wastewater testing, scientists are excited for the myriad of possible uses sewage sampling could offer. 

The most obvious application would be to screen for other diseases, but the potential of wastewater testing is much more far-reaching. 

Biobot Analytics, the first company in the world to profit from sewage health data, was the first group in the U.S. to use sewage data to track the spread of covid-19[5]. 

Before the pandemic, Biobot focused on gathering data on opioid usage, which was paused to focus on covid-19. Now, the company is resuming its efforts[6] with increased technology and resources: 

'Biobot's High Risk Substance platform provides unbiased, naturally anonymized data on community use of fentanyl, methamphetamine, cocaine, and nicotine. Monthly reports help public health officials establish a baseline level of substance use in their community, identify which substances are most commonly used, determine seasonality of use, and better measure evidence-based public health interventions. 

'Others want to monitor health in a broader sense,' The Economist explains, laying out a range of possible applications[1] for wastewater testing: 

'In 2019 researchers at Arizona State University published a wastewater study that analyzed levels of phytoestrogens, chemicals found in plant-based foods. It suggested that sewage monitoring could be used to keep track of a nation's eating habits. Kando[7] has a list of over 500 biomarkers potentially detectable in wastewater. The company hopes that levels of one of these, serotonin, might yield interesting data on depression. In Australia, researchers use sewage to keep track of nicotine and alcohol consumption.' 

Despite the already widespread success that wastewater testing has had with monitoring covid-19 and the countless possibilities that this technology has to offer, KWR's first covid-19 testing program demonstrates that sewage sampling programs must start small and expand later. A relevant and increasingly common example is wastewater testing at universities like UCLA. 

Universities serve as hubs not only for students, but for the surrounding community — faculty,employees and local residents who may visit the campus. 

This makes university campuses — especially ones with the population and resources of UCLA — ideal communities to implement a wastewater testing program. 

Universities are communities that can serve as test runs for wastewater testing programs, but the concept of starting these programs at a small scale and expanding them later was demonstrated within UCLA itself. 

In 2020, UCLA's program started only at two housing units[8], De Neve and Sunset Village, and later expanded to include all on-campus residence buildings. These buildings, which include restrooms, are all under one institution, streamlining coordination of wastewater surveillance. 

With this data, trends in COVID infection can be forecasted and analyzed for the UCLA community, as dorming students will frequently come into contact with students, faculty, employees and others living off-campus. 

Unlike other protocols, wastewater testing will likely remain relatively constant. 

Though UCLA is easing up on covid-19 protocols[9], future spikes in covid-19 cases may lead to the reinstatement of requirements such as mandatory indoor masking — as occurred during the 2021-2022 school year[10]. 

But even if protocols remain the same throughout the 2022-2023 school year, covid-19 testing in general will still be encouraged, and will likely remain obligatory when individuals are at high risk of infection — when they exhibit symptoms, have been exposed to positive cases, or if covid-19 has been detected in their residence hall's wastewater[11]. 

UCLA should expand its wastewater testing program to all buildings on campus, but concerns like logistics are valid reasons for the program's currently limited scope — most buildings are not as interconnected as The Hill, where the dorms are located. 

As promising as wastewater testing is, U.S. citizens — including university students — should be willing to consider how these programs factor into discussions on surveillance and privacy. 

The Economist explains[1] that 'in Singapore and Hong Kong it has proved possible to monitor waste from individual apartment buildings and hospitals. In both places, these techniques—coupled with shoe-leather epidemiology—allowed authorities to identify individual covid-19 patients from within individual blocks of flats.' 

With such precision, and the ever-increasing range of data that can be detected in wastewater, the public has good reason to be wary of the risk of legitimizing this powerful tool. 

'Popular support will be harder to secure if people worry that their data might be widely shared,' warns The Economist[3]. 'Testing bodies should therefore be open about the extent of their capabilities, and exactly how data will be used. They should also consult with the people being monitored, so that something approaching informed consent can be obtained.' 

Still, covid-19 has pushed scientists to draw on many resources to form creative and important solutions — even if they use something as unsavory as sewage.

2022-10-04,Student Opinion: Testing for Covid-19 in Wastewater May Have Impacts Beyond the Pandemic,,"Apr 23, 2020( City Limits: http://www.citylimits.org Delivered by Newstex) ; Metropolitan Museum of Art. , Stevepb, Tomasz SienickiNew data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention confirm that people with lung disease, heart disease, hypertension, or diabetes who contract COVID-19 have a much poorer clinical course, compared with people without these conditions. Figures as of March 28 showed that the risk of an ICU admission was 2.2 percent to 2.4 percent in those without underlying conditions and 13.3 percent to 14.5 percent in those with such conditions. 
Of those who died, 94 percent had one or more underlying health problems.So far, government advisories have been silent on steps to address these underlying conditions, focusing instead on avoiding the virus, rather than strengthening the host. But when this strategy fails, as it often does, and infection takes hold, these neglected conditions lay a path to a grim outcome.If we have imagined that the oncoming locomotive of COVID-19 has left us no time to bring these underlying conditions under better control, it is time to think again. According to theInstitute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, the COVID-19 epidemic will nottaper off until mid- to late June. This means that, over the next eight weeks or so, many people will acquire the virus. A lot can be done in eight weeks. Moreover, virologists are already predicting a recurrence in the fall. Now is the time for action. So what can be done? First, we can quit smoking. Influenza infections occur five times more often in smokers than nonsmokers, and there is no reason to believe that COVID-19 is any more benign to smokers. Smoking cessation improves lung function and reduces sputum neutrophil (white blood cell) counts within six weeks.Second, we can optimize medications. Roughly half of individuals with hypertension or diabetes are undertreated. Restoring lapsed prescriptions and treating to target can be done in a matter of weeks.Third, we can implement diet changes. The Dietary Approaches to Stop Hypertension (DASH) study showed that diet changes alone can reduce blood pressure in eight weeks. Within a similar timeframe, low-fat plant-based diets reduce body weight and improve blood sugar control and blood cholesterol concentrations. Limited evidence suggests that diet changes, especially avoiding dairy products, may also rapidly improve lung function in individuals with asthma. CityViews[1] are readers' opinions, not those of City Limits. Add your voice today![2] This is precisely why Brooklyn has enacted policy initiatives to help community members adopt healthier diets rich in fruits, vegetables, and grains. Whether it's Meatless Mondays for schoolchildren, the plant-based lifestyle medicine clinic at NYC Health+Hospitals/Bellevue, or veg-curious meet-ups, Brooklyn is encouraging its constituents to protect their health through their food choices. Those who have done so may now have a better chance of fighting COVID-19, and we encourage communities throughout the U.S. to optimize their diet as soon as possible. Once we've emerged on the other side of this pandemic, nutrition initiatives need to stay central to the conversation around health.Faced with a novel threat for which we have no treatment, we may take a lesson from a curious observation during the H1N1 pandemic of 1918. At a Minnesota seminary, 90 of the 120 students and faculty developed influenza symptoms. However, in sharp contrast to the devastating statistics elsewhere, none of these individuals progressed to pneumonia and none died. What differentiated the seminarians from the general population was that they were nonsmoking, teetotaling individuals fed a diet of grains, fruits, nuts, and vegetables—precisely the sort of plant-based regimen that modern randomized trials have shown to be effective for treating diabetes, hypertension, and lipid disorders.Quitting smoking, optimizing our medication doses, and making diet changes to shore up our heart and lungs will not shield us from contagion; that is what handwashing, hygiene, and social distancing are for. But they will ameliorate the underlying conditions, and that may determine who lives and who dies. We have time—barely. Let us not waste it.Eric LeroyAdamsis the Borough President of Brooklyn.

2020-04-23,Opinion: COVID-19's Toll Forces a Focus on NYC's Underlying Health Risks,,"With the latest wave of COVID-19 infections sweeping steadily across Sri Lanka, attention has been directed towards persons with uncontrolled, pre-existing conditions, particularly diabetes; as a sect most vulnerable to get severely ill or die because of complications caused by the virus. This has shed light on another growing concern among healthcare providers and patients, which is that patients suffering from diabetes or other chronic conditions are finding it increasingly difficult or are unable to access the medical care they require due to mandatory albeit essential curfew measures combined with a deep fear of contracting the virus in communal healthcare settings.
With a staggering 463 million adult diabetic patients present worldwide, World Diabetes Day 2020 - falling on the 14th of November- is a critical time for diabetes support communities and healthcare advocates to rally together to create awareness about this debilitating medical condition and push for progress in the standards of care and the better management of diabetic patients during a pandemic. In Sri Lanka alone, 1 in 10 adults are approximated to suffer from the disease. It is also then vital to look at ways to help stop more people from getting this disease, particularly at a time when 'lockdown' lifestyles are more often than not likely to be sedentary, unhealthy and stressful; an ideal background for a diabetes diagnosis.
Why is uncontrolled diabetes such a potent accelerant for COVID-19?
A recent study conducted by Lancet on Diabetes & Endocrinology screened over 61 million medical records in the U.K. to find that 30% of COVID-19 deaths can be attributed to people with diabetes. After accounting for factors such as demography and chronic medical conditions, the risk of succumbing to the virus was shown to be about three times higher for people with Type 1 diabetes and almost twice as high for Type 2, versus those without the disease.
There appears to be two primary reasons driving this predicament. Over a lifetime, poor glucose control inflicts widespread damage in our systems which can lead to strokes, heart attacks, kidney failure, eye disease, and limb amputations. The linings of blood vessels throughout the body weaken to an extent where they can't ferry necessary nutrients adequately. Inflammation is another byproduct of poor diabetes control, which makes the body ill-prepared for the onslaught of the viral disease. Secondly, the rich environment of elevated blood glucose present in diabetic patients, makes them prone to superadded bacterial complications during the viral infection. Many diabetics also tend to have other co-morbidities such as obesity, hypertension, and heart disease, which are all factors that aggravate complications during viral illneses. These problems are seen in any infections in the setting of diabetes and not only with COVID 19. The pandemic has just highlighted the difficulties of having diabetes
What precautions can diabetic patients take?
So during this pandemic, apart from strict adherence to general COVID-19 personal safety protocols such as strict social distancing and sanitization, it is important for patients to regularly monitor their glucose levels to avoid complications caused by fluctuating blood glucose. Proper hydration is essential for good health. It is also crucial to have access to a good supply of the prescribed diabetes medications and healthy food so that patients are able to correct the situation if blood glucose levels fluctuate. Finally, sticking to a comfortable daily routine, maintaining an exercise program even within the confines of your home, reducing excessive work and having a good night's sleep can go a long way in keeping you strong.In essence, maintaining good blood sugar levels may be their best defense against severe COVID-19.
Disruption to continuity of care for diabetes patients
A rapid assessment survey conducted by WHO among Ministries of Health across many countries, focusing on the service delivery for NCDs during the COVID-19 pandemic, revealed deepening concerns that many people living with NCDs are no longer receiving appropriate treatment or access to medicines during the COVID-19 pandemic. The more severe the transmission phase of the COVID-19 pandemic, the more NCD care services were disrupted.
With our country currently in the cluster transmission phase and heading towards the community transmission phase due to the large and distant spread of the first-line contacts, the threat to NCD care and especially routine and emergency care of diabetes patients worries us physicians. As healthcare providers, we too are torn between the dilemma of not wanting to expose our patients to unnecessary hospital visits and the need to ensure that all our patients have continued access to their healthcare team along with a steady supply of medicines and other diabetes care products such as glucometer strips and insulin. Unfortunately, the delay in visiting their healthcare provider when they have symptoms of complications has caused many people to present late to the hospital with heart attacks or infections. A delayed presentation, weakens the patient further.
This disruption to healthcare services is foreseen to be a huge dilemma for patients and healthcare providers alike, especially when it comes to the care of patients with diabetes and other non-communicable diseases. In Sri Lanka, the Ministry of Health, is currently providing a number of telemedicine services and has opened avenues to deliver medicines to houses without diabetic persons having to visit crowded settings
How do we counter this? 
At Healthy Life Clinic, we adhere strictly to COVID-19 safety operational health protocols established according to Ministry of Health (MOH), Epidemiology Unit. All incoming patients are screened by our nurses as soon as appointments are made over the phone, to understand the nature of their illness. If there is a worry that they could have contracted COVID-19 or have been in contact with such patients, they are given the opportunity to speak to the doctor first over the phone for a detailed history. Every patient will be consulted and no one is turned away from our care.
In order to help patients overcome barriers such as curfews or even the fear of entering communal healthcare settings, our experienced, highly-regarded team of consultants conducts telehealth consultations via established, trusted telemedicine partners such as oDoc and Mydoctor.lk to maintain continuity of care throughout this pandemic. We have also moved many of our long-standing diabetes care and weight management programs online, which have proven to be effective even in the absence of a physical meeting and examination. Additionally, our social media platforms and website are constantly updated to increase awareness about this condition, along with content that informs people about the proper management and prevention of diabetes - particularly when it is thus connected to COVID-19.

2020-11-13,Opinion: COVID 19 & Diabetes; a lethal partnership? How do we overcome this?,,"By Michael Sainsbury
The Muslim holy month of Ramadan could not come at a worse time in South and Southeast Asia as governments battle to keep the Covid-19 pandemic at bay, presenting multiple potential dangers for Islam's hundreds of millions of followers and their countrymen.
Ramadan is, of course, a landmark event in the Muslim calendar celebrating the month when the Prophet Muhammad was handed the Quran by God (Allah). It is marked by fasting from sunrise to sunset, then each evening is celebrated with a meal known as iftar to break the fast with friends and family.
This celebration has been marked by mass gatherings over the years. The emphasis on friendship during the festival is particularly strong. Along with the centrality of communal prayer to Islam generally and special holidays in particular, this is where Ramadan may pose some danger.
Add to the mix the poor track record, so far, of some Muslim nations in the region of countering the spread of coronavirus, particularly Pakistan, Bangladesh and Indonesia, and there is a recipe for potential disaster. The official death toll in all three places is widely believed to be under-reported by experts.
Daeng Faqih, chairman of the Indonesian Doctors Association, said Indonesia's death toll from Covid-19 had probably reached 1,000 on April 18, nearly double the official figure of 535. Two days later, the toll was officially 100 higher.
""Those who were yet to be confirmed with Covid-19 were also reported by hospitals as death by coronavirus,"" Faqih said.
Pakistan is the most problematic, with religious and secular leaders unable to find any consensus on halting activities in mosques. Hardline clerics and their followers were packed cheek by jowl into mosques in the country last Friday, according to multiple media reports. It seems that their intention is to continue, with the big test coming on April 24, the first Friday of Ramadan.
Similar problems have been encountered in parts of Bangladesh and Indonesia.
Muslims and their neighbors are better off in India, home to as many as 200 million believers, due to the central government's hard lockdown of the country that was recently extended until May 3, covering the first 10 days of Ramadan. All but essential services are closed and religious places of all kinds have been shuttered.
No one has any clue how effective India's efforts will be, especially as testing has been very low, as it is everywhere in Asia due to a lack of preparedness and resources.
Ramadan is a moving holiday in the Muslim calendar and shifts around the universally used Gregorian calendar. This year it begins on April 23 or 24 depending on which country — and again this is determined by the moon. Ramadan lasts from the first until the next sighting of the crescent (new) moon and can stretch from 29 to 31 days. In most of Asia, it begins on April 23 but, moving west, it starts on April 24 in Pakistan.
The US-based Pew Institute's latest survey of more than 200 countries estimates there are about 1.57 billion Muslims worldwide — roughly 23 percent of the total 6.8 billion global population.
Almost 62 percent of the world's Muslims live in the Asia-Pacific region, which is home to the four biggest Muslim nations on earth: Indonesia, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh.
Malaysia is majority Muslim and home to about 20 million followers. The tiny nations of Brunei and the Maldives are also Muslim, while every country in the region has smaller but often significant Muslim populations that run into the millions. Even China has more Muslims than Syria.
Problematically, the news that Islamic conferences were hotspots that helped to spread the virus around South and Southeast Asia has triggered fresh waves of Islamophobia in some countries, most notably India. Here, the Hindu nationalist Narendra Modi government has effectively given Hindu mobs license to terrorize Muslims; in some cases this has resulted in deaths by lynching.
Any sense that Indian Muslims are breaching lockdown guidelines for their faith will surely have their opponents causing very dangerous trouble.
The end of Ramadan presents another challenge. The three-day Eid al-Fitr festival brings another round of communal praying. Yet, like Ramadan, there is a strong theme of charity. The most charitable things Muslims can do are the hardest — resisting the temptation to have mass prayers so that they keep themselves and their neighbors safe. That, after all, is as charitable as it gets.

 Authored by former CDC Director Dr. Robert Redfield and NYU clinical professor Dr. Marc Siegel, the Op-Ed calls out the Chinese government for preventing the CDC from visiting Wuhan, China or the Wuhan Institute of Virology in early 2020 - which forced US investigators to 'put together the circumstantial pieces of the puzzle on our own.' 
 The doctors note: 

On Sept. 12, 2019, coronavirus bat sequences were deleted from the institute's database. Why? It changed the security protocols for the lab. Why? It put out requests for more than $600 million for a new ventilation system. What prompted this new need? 

In January 2020 two hypotheses emerged about the origin of the novel coronavirus: that it began in a bat, then infected another animal before spreading to humans in a Wuhan 'wet market,' where wild animals are sold for meat; or that it emerged from the Wuhan laboratory. The wet-market story was pushed by the Chinese CDC and the World Health Organization. Public-health leaders argued that Covid-19 was like SARS and MERS, earlier coronaviruses that emerged from bats and spread through an intermediate animal. 
 But neither of those viruses has ever evolved to the point where it can transmit efficiently from one human to the next. There have been fewer than 10,000 cases of each virus world-wide since SARS was discovered in 2003 and MERS in 2012. What virus comes out of a bat cave and infects humans by the millions? It's not biologically plausible. If instead it evolved slowly over many years in nature, how come no one knew of it? -WSJ 

 What does bear investigation, they write, is the hypothesis that SARS-CoV-2 was 'taught' to infect humans using humanized mice (grafted with human tissue and immune cells) in order to test whether the virus's 'cleavage site' was manipulated to more easily infect a human cell. 
 https://video-api.wsj.com/api-video/player/v3/iframe.html?guid=83D5E046-EB84-4518-B560-A66442D10E74[4] 
 They also note a 'growing body of circumstantial evidence' supporting the lab-leak theory - including info gleaned by the US State Department that Wuhan lab workers fell ill with Covid-like symptoms in the fall of 2019. 

The story of SARS-Cov-2 started long before January 2020. We believe the virus was most likely uncontained in a laboratory where it was being worked on, and that it escaped unintentionally. A Harvard study[5] of satellite images revealed a shutdown of traffic around the Wuhan lab in the late summer and early fall of 2019. Weeks later, in late September, the hospital parking lots were filling up. 
 There were hallmarks of scientific arrogance and failures in the containment system. China's CDC initially appeared to be out of the loop but later became a key messenger, selling the natural-origin and wet-market theory. Another apparent misdirection was several key scientists' insistence on a narrow definition of 'gain of function' research to include remodeling, overt bioengineering, shaping or constructing a virus. As far as we're concerned, if a virus is taught to or evolves in a lab to infect human tissue more efficiently, that's gain of function. -WSJ 

According to the doctors, there is a 'global need' to know the truth, because it affects how we approach the problem, and 'variants are emerging rapidly that continue to change the game. All this is in keeping with a virus that more likely jumped from a bat to a lab, not to a rat or a rabbit.' 
 Until we know what happened in Wuhan, Redfield and Siegel have called for a moratorium on so-called 'gain-of-function' research while authorities carefully craft policy to avoid the next pandemic.

2021-08-17,"WSJ Op-Ed: Covid-19 Most Likely 'Worked On' In Lab, Then Escaped",,"Joel Gallo is the CEO of Columbia China League Business Advisory Co. Ltd., a Guangzhou-based management consulting firm.
As U.S. President Barack Obama's time in office drew to a close, he offered then incoming President Donald Trump several recommendations from his previous eight years in office. One of those sobering reflections: ""American leadership in this world is really indispensable, it is up to us through action and example to sustain the international order,"" reverberates louder than a mid-summer thunderstorm. In a coronavirus-stricken world where tragic loss of life continues to mount daily and national economies are on fiscally-induced life support, the need for global coordination has never been greater.
As we try to fully comprehend the scale of the dislocation, one thing is for certain - future crises including aftershocks from Covid-19 or a new black swan event, will be managed with a United States that is antagonistic, inward-looking and uninterested in leading the world. As the existing order becomes unmoored and set adrift - Who will play the role of cop on the global beat or firefighter of last resort, in short first responder? With America's abdication to stand watch over the guard rails that preserve international order, countries jostling for power will lead to heightened conflict on the world stage.
Over the past four years, Trump's America First agenda has been a rude awakening to policymakers from both parties who embrace the liberal international order. His worldview questions the value of free trade, eschews multilateral agreements and is cynical about the contribution of allies. Trump's doctrine ambles to a cadence that his sympathizers hear - multilateralism is a ploy by client states bent on exploiting America's largesse.
As Washington exits, others from Beijing to Moscow feel emboldened to fill the void but up to a point. For no other nation is willing to shoulder the colossal responsibility of purveyor of public goods and guarantor of global security. As much as Washington hawks fret about China replacing America's hegemony, the fact is that Beijing's paramount concern is to maintain social stability through continued economic growth and domestic development. It entertains no illusions of picking up the baton and accepting the global burdens that America drops. Does Beijing harbor other ambitions? Clearly. So does America. But those other objectives remain pipedreams if the economic engine sputters. Other contenders from the G-20, either individually or as a block do not possess the institutional heft to confront cross-border challenges.
What gets lost in the dualistic argument - China's ascent comes at the expense of America's decline - is the following inconvenient truth. China and the United States will emerge from Covid-19 in weaker form. With millions of workers thrown off payrolls, and credit downgrades and defaults surely to follow, public purses will be saddled with ever higher levels of debt. The new global framework will usher two convalescing patients. America and China, with structural damage to their economies and tarnished international prestige, will emerge weaker at home and constrained abroad.
The aftermath of Covid-19 will harden two trends that have been set in motion. First, countries will be less inclined to collaborate even when it is for the greater good. For that look no further than the contentious relationship between China and the United States that plumbs new lows every day. When the two largest economies cannot provide the semblance of unity to defeat a deadly virus, collaboration on other fronts becomes nearly impossible.
What happens if the twin forces of a public health crisis and economic collapse overwhelm a developing country? Who will step into the fray to help? What starts out as a local event can quickly morph into a transnational problem as internally displaced persons, disease, famine and violence leaps across borders. Multilateral agencies may be willing to answer the call but their firefighting effort will be limited as their mandate lacks any real teeth. America, China and Europe may grant aid but without any true coordination. Unless their strategic interests are imperiled, assistance may be symbolic rather than substantive. Developing nations will be left to fend for themselves.
Second, with countries consumed with their own self-interests, beggar thy neighbor policies will gain traction. Even harsh measures against the staunchest of allies are not off limits. This includes banning exports of desperately needed N95 masks to the closest of friends, as America informed Canada, only to be reprimanded that health care workers move in both directions across the border. In an increasingly fragmented Europe, Germany and the Czech Republic were advised not to block export of medical protective gear between member states.
While some policies will be enacted as a way to protect strategic imperatives, others are opportunistic aimed at weakening geopolitical adversaries. Either way, such actions will place added stress on the fissures that have emerged in the globalization model. Covid-19 will hurtle America and China faster toward decoupling and aggravate other flashpoints besides global trade that span telecommunications standards (5G), internet bifurcation, re-shoring of global supply chains and weaponization of financial networks.
Without a global referee, even multilateral institutions - impartial arbiters of rules-based collaboration - are deemed irrelevant and eviscerated. The World Trade Organization's appellate body undercut by the Trump administration languishes in near obsolescence. While the World Health Organization - made a scapegoat for supposedly cozying up to China during the early days of the pandemic - is assailed and underfunded.
Coronavirus is a game changer not so much in that it plots a new trajectory. Instead it pushes nations along a steadily progressing march toward international chaos amidst a cacophony of isolationism and nationalism. In a leaderless world, no individual nation has the wherewithal to steer a global agenda. And great power discord amidst a sea of distrust makes cooperation in areas of mutual interest - climate change, nuclear proliferation, pandemic resilience, poverty reduction, terrorism - all the more unattainable. Yet, as the two largest economies, America and China need an urgent rethink in their approach and establish a framework that allows for constructive engagement. Regrettably, the disjointed global effort on Covid-19 is revealing that international cooperation, like a ship without a captain at the helm, is lost and drifting aimlessly.

2020-05-14,Opinion: Covid-19 Will Accelerate Trend Toward Leaderless World,,"The Teresita L. Jalandoni Provincial Hospital in Silay City, Negros Occidental returned to normal operations on Friday after cases of coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) among its medical and support personnel have dropped.
We are happy to inform the public that due to the downward trend in Covid-19 infection of TLJPH front-liners, we shall resume regular services for all areas starting today, the management headed by chief of hospital Dr. Mary Ann Maestral said in a statement.
Provincial Administrator Rayfrando Diaz II said he discussed the resumption of full operations with Maestral after confirmed Covid-19 cases involving hospital front-liners dropped to only 38 and those quarantined decreased to only eight as of February 2.
On January 25, there were 63 positive cases and 38 under quarantine.
Some healthcare workers are back to work especially in TLJPH, Diaz said.
According to the hospital management, all patient referrals must still be coursed through the province's One Hospital System through the city or municipal health office.
We again remind the public to refrain from unnecessary exposure and to continue to observe the recommended health protocols to keep cases down in our community, it added.
In mid-January, the TLJPH suspended its outpatient services in the obstetrics and gynecology department, where most of the infected personnel are assigned.
The following week, it also suspended its regular services, including those in the out-patient department and Covid-19 vaccination, and limited admissions to extreme emergency cases only. - PNA","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); BUSINESS OPERATIONS (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); ISOLATION & QUARANTINE (78%); VIRUSES (78%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (77%); TRENDS (77%); OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY (73%); VACCINES (73%)

2022-02-07,Philippines : NegOcc prov'l hospital resumes ops after Covid-19 cases drop,,"Libya recorded its first case of the coronavirus on Tuesday, the UN-backed government announced, stoking concern that an outbreak could overwhelm the war-torn country's already weakened health care system.
The first case was a 73-year-old man who crossed into Libya from neighboring Tunisia on March 5. The Libyan patient had recently traveled to Saudi Arabia, according to the National Center for Disease Control, and is receiving medical treatment for his fever and cough in isolation at a Tripoli hospital.
The doctors said the man is highly contagious.
As the novel coronavirus pandemic sweeps across the Middle East, countries have sought to slow the increase of cases by limiting the movements of hundreds of millions of people. There are over 31,000 cases of the novel coronavirus across the Mid-East, the vast majority in the hard-hit nation of Iran.
Coronavirus could to stop the fighting in Libya. Although Libya has only recorded just one case, the World Health Organization representative in Tripoli has warned of the great risks faced if the virus spreads in a country fragmented by conflict.
According to what the world is witnessing, the internationally recognized Libyan government based in Tripoli, and led by Faiez Serraj, announced a series of measures aimed at mitigating the spread of the coronavirus (Covid-19), including a state of emergency and half a billion dinars to fight the virus. They also closed of all Libyan land, air and sea borders for three weeks from 16 March.
In addition, all educational institutions are closed for two weeks, with the possibility of extension, and all sports and cultural activities and gatherings to be halted as well as wedding and occasions halls are to be closed.
The government has allowed cafes and restaurants with ""a high standard of hygiene"" to be open until 4 pm, while all other establishments and shisha establishments are to be closed. Mosques are also to be closed for prayers. The state internet company has been urged to provide reduced internet packages to enable increased internet use from homes.
In response to the coronavirus pandemic, both the Tripoli and Benghazi administrations have pledged money for local health initiatives.
A joint statement on Tuesday from Algeria, Britain, France, Germany, Italy, the Netherlands, the United States, the European Union, Tunisia and the United Arab Emirates said a truce would help efforts to tackle the virus. As such, this virus could help the two governments to be more cooperative in a spirit of national cohesion and urged to take all the necessary measures to support the health and well-being of all Libyans.
Moreover, this virus will provide a truce could also enable combatants to return home to provide care for relatives who may be at higher risk.
Meanwhile, the government in eastern Libya had also put into action a state of emergency plan to mitigate the virus. They set up their own virus testing lab to avoid the time-wasting process of sending samples to Tripoli, and announced that the suspected seven cases across the country, who were placed into quarantine last week, had all tested negative. These were; two cases in Benghazi, two in Misrata, one in Zliten, one in Zawia and one suspected case in the Amal oilfield.
As the capital remains under attack with a more silent and deadly form of assault, the governments and businesses quickly turndc to email and texting to allay the fears of citizens and customers with messages about coronavirus
The pandemic is causing panic and distress as it travels throughout the globe, ignoring all borders, from cyber attackers taking full advantage of peoples' concerns and desire to arm themselves with information about the spread of COVID 19.
Cyber attackers have used an application called 'Corona Live 1.1.' that lulls the user into a false sense of security reassuring them that no special access is required, however, as the individual continues with the application, access to device location, media files and photos is subtly requested. This application is part of a SpyMax example, which is a trojanized version of the 'Corona live' app used by Johns Hopkins University 'Coronavirus tracker' which covers the entire range of infection rates, number of deaths and geographical spread of the pandemic.
Once the unsuspecting user is reeled in, the application allows access to the perpetrator, of remote activation of personal camera, microphone and all private files on the user's device.
One of the operators seems to be a Libyan Telecom and Technology company and internet provider, whose IP address shows they are possibly part of a group used for DSL connections.
It is feared the application not only gives personal data, but could be used in committing extortion through accessing personal data for ransom as usual in Libya, or to gather intelligence and information on political players, which is potentially very dangerous and corrosive to the Libyan nation in the present situation.

2020-03-26,Libya Records First Covid-19 Case – OpEd,,"Verdict has conducted a poll to assess how healthcare providers should use PPE after the COVID-19 pandemic. Analysis of the poll results shows that healthcare providers should continue to use PPE at the same frequency as now in all healthcare settings, as voted by 59% of the respondents. The frequency of PPE usage should remain the same post-COVID, but only in the busiest parts of hospitals such as emergency departments, as opined by 17% of the respondents. 
According to 8% of the respondents, PPE should be used at the same frequency as during COVID, but only in certain seasons such as flu season. Further, 10% of the respondents voted that PPE should be used less frequently after COVID, while 6% of the respondents opined that PPE should be used by healthcare providers under other conditions after the pandemic. The analysis is based on 321 responses received from the readers of Hospital Management, a Verdict network site, between 18 January and 02 March. PPE usage during and after the COVID-19 pandemicThe surge in use of PPE during the coronavirus pandemic led to a worldwide shortage of various PPE equipment including protective suits, gowns, gloves, face shields, masks, and goggles. PPE shortage was a major reason behind high rates of infection among healthcare providers in Italy and the US, where healthcare facilities were overwhelmed due to the mounting number of COVID-19 cases. PPE usage is expected to continue post-pandemic with expenditure on PPE projected to triple by 2027, according to the Health Industry Distributors Association. Researchers are, therefore, working towards making PPE equipment more effective, biodegradable, and sustainable. Researchers from the University of Alberta are, for example, developing a fabric treatment for medical gowns and masks that can kill viruses and bacteria upon contact.",,307,Eurasia Review
2021-03-05,"Healthcare providers should continue to use PPE post COVID-19, opine majority in a poll",,"India's total Covid19 cases since the pandemic began swept past 25 million on May 24, 2021 as the country registered more than 300.000coronavirusdeaths. Experts warn that both the number of deaths and total reported cases are likely vast undercounts.
And the virus of scapegoating due to fear and anxiety is spreading as well. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an ""all-out effort"" to end the ""tsunami of hate and xenophobia, scapegoating and scaremongering,"". Guterres said: ""Anti-foreigner sentiment has surged online and in the streets. Anti-Semitic conspiracy theories have spread and COVID-19-related anti-Muslim attacks have occurred.""
Scapegoatingrefers to the human tendency to blame someone else for one's own economic, social or personal problems, a process that often comes from already existing feelings of prejudice toward the group that one is blaming.
Scapegoatingserves as an opportunity to publicly vent one's own frustrations, rage and hate, while ignoring one's own failures or misdeeds and maintaining one's positive self-image.
Whatmakes otherwise rational people buy into conspiracy theories and unfounded rumors about those they consider to be outsiders?
People with certain personality traits are much more likely to believe in conspiracy theories. For example. a Yahoo News/YouGov poll, found that 44 percent of American Republicans believe Bill Gates is plotting to use the mass COVID-19 vaccination campaign as a pretext to implant microchips in billions of people and monitor their movements. This awidely debunked conspiracy theory with no basis in fact.
And in the UK according to research conducted by clinical psychologists at Oxford University; 60% of adults believe to some extent that the British government is misleading the UK public about the cause of the virus; 20% believe to some extent that the virus is a hoax; and almost 20 percent of adults in England believe that Jews created the coronavirus for financial gain.
Participants in the survey were asked to what extent they agreed with the statement: ""Jews have created the virus to collapse the economy for financial gain."" According to the survey, 80.8% said they do not agree, 5.3% said they agree a little, 6.8% said they agree moderately, 4.6% said they agree a lot, while 2.4% said they agree completely.
The figures were almost identical when respondents were asked whether they agreed with the statement, ""Muslims are spreading the virus as an attack on Western values.""
Even Muslims believe COVID-19 was a human caused rather than a just a natural event. According to a poll of 2556 persons released by Minasat on May 20, 2020, 59% of Moroccans believe COVID-19 was made in a lab, and 22% believe the virus was natural, while 5% think the virus is either a divine punishment or believe it was the product of pure chance.
It is important for all members of minority groups to realize for themselves, and also teach others, that the victims of hate filled scapegoaters are completely innocent of all responsibility for the actual problems that the scapegoater has.
Do not ever let children fall for the hate virus that claims the victims somehow brought this hatred upon themselves.
The idea that Jews are powerful and engaged in secret evil plots has historically emergedduring times of societal stress, such as periods of pandemic or high unemployment because they allow people to consolidate blame for a complex set of societal and economic circumstances on a single scapegoat.
The Coronavirus pandemic may be novel, but Jews have had a long and tragic history of being accused of spreading deadly viruses. During the Black Death which started in 1348, many dozens of Jewish communities in Western Europe were attacked, despite the intervention of Pope Clement VI, who pointed out that Jews were dying from the plague just like everyone else (although Jews were less likely to get the Black Death plague because their religion forbid eating any animal like rats that died of natural causes). Nothing like this happened in the Arab or Muslim world although the bubonic plague swept through it as well.
Since Jews are the religious community most accepting of Covid-19 vaccinations, they could be scapegoated again. A recent PPRI poll found that Jewish Americans (85%) are by far the most likely to be vaccine accepters, to have received a vaccine, or to say they will get vaccinated as soon as possible.
Of white Catholics (68%) are vaccine accepters, as are 64% of other Christians, 63% of white mainline Protestants, and 63% of other non-Christian religious Americans. Majorities of religiously unaffiliated Americans (60%) and Hispanic Catholics (56%), are also vaccine accepters.
Mormons (50%), Black Protestants (49%), other Protestants of color (45%), white evangelical Protestants (45%), and Hispanic Protestants (43%) say they have gotten or will get vaccinated as soon as possible.
Among the religious groups least receptive to the vaccines, white evangelical Protestants stand out as the most likely to say they will refuse to get vaccinated (26%), with an additional 28% who are hesitant. About one in five other Protestants of color (20%), Black Protestants (19%), and Mormons (17%) say they will not get vaccinated, and another one-third of each are hesitant (35%, 32%, and 33%, respectively).
Among these less receptive religious groups, Hispanic Protestants are less likely to say they will not get vaccinated (15%) but more likely than any other religious group to be vaccine hesitant (42%)
The media must expose all scapegoating where ever it occurs.

2020-10-02,HOME MINISTRY READY TO STEP UP 'OP BENTENG' WITH COVID-19 SPIKE - HAMZAH,,"ByDr. Philip Dandolov
Euroscepticism is a multifaceted phenomenon that has increasingly been the subject of analysis by scholars of European integration since the 1990s. The European Union has faced a multitude of serious challenges in the past, such as the European migrant crisis, which peaked in 2015, as well as the fall-outs from the financial crisis of 2007-2008, that have negatively affected public perceptions of this political and economic union. However, the COVID-19 pandemic appears almost unique in terms of the likelihood of entrenching Eurosceptic sentiments through most of 2021.
One of the important potential sources of Euroscepticism is the economic performance of the nation-states that are part of the EU. A worsening of the leading economic indicators, or at least a perception that there is a trend in that direction, is likely to induce less favorable appraisals of the EU. In that regard, while the impacts of the pandemic have been uneven across countries, all of them have had to contend withsevere output lossesand areduced economic growth. Furthermore, recent research on the economic aspects of Euroscepticismsuggests thatthe economic and fiscal conditions in other EU countries may raise concerns among the domestic public about negative spillovers if the national economy appears to be doing well, thus reducing the trust in the EU and leading to elevated levels of Euroscepticism.
Few EU countries,among them Latvia and Slovakia, appear to have remained relatively unscathed from an economic standpoint while also dealing well with the medical aspects of the crisis. Even if COVID-19 is temporarily brought under control at a certain location, the nature of the virus' transmission presupposes that any new cases subsequently introduced from abroad that are not quarantined and properly traced may quickly bring about exponential spread. Such a scenario would in turn negatively affect the economic outlook because of the need for the imposition of new restrictions on businesses and the corresponding changes in the behavior of the consumers. In a sense, the belief that any victory proclaimed by the citizens of those nation-states who have been model pupils in handling COVID-19 would likely be short-lived (due to the interconnected nature of the EU) could invite Eurosceptic actors to fill the political void.
Another reliable predictor of Euroscepticism appears to be the degree to which citizens believe in their own national governments. This confidence expressed in the national authoritiestends to be extendedfrom domestic political contexts to the EU level. Policies in response to COVID-19 were not able to shield the populations of the EU states from serious health-related, economic, and psychological repercussions. This has resulted ina reduced trustin many national leaders, including Emmanuel Macron in France and Pedro Sánchez in Spain (notwithstanding the initial increase in their popularity in March 2020, attributable to the rally-round-the-flag effect in the days when the pandemic began unfolding), even in countriessuch as Swedenwhere authorities as a rule are regarded as trustworthy. Thus, with national governments not being in a good position to protect their citizensagainst insecurity, and EU officials themselves facing criticism for not beingespecially proactivein combating COVID-19, the EU will have to pay a legitimacy price in terms of its perceived competency to deliver crucial public goods. Given that most EU nation-states will likely not have the luxury to significantly relax the vast majority of pandemic-related measures at least for a few more months, there will probably be a dearth of opportunities for offsetting the negative attributes projected onto the EU, at least until mass vaccination has dramatically altered the epidemiological situation in individual countries.
Another salient aspect with regard to Euroscepticism concerns the reality that it is to a larger degree theprerogative of parties on the right or far-rightof the political spectrum, especially if there are citizen grievances with the EU project that go beyond narrow economic concerns. In relation to the COVID-19 pandemic, the emerging consensus among epidemiologists and public health experts appears to be that a strict approach that borders oneliminationism(rather than half-hearted restrictions inviting a long-term coexistence with the virus) is the proper course of action from the standpoint of both the overall health picture and the economy. Unlike in the case of the Americas where leadersespousing right-wing populismsuch as Donald Trump and Jair Bolsonaro weresharply criticizedfor their actions in relation to the pandemic, to a large extent because of the lack of willingness to close many sectors of the national economies and theiropposition tomask mandates, right-wing politicians in Europe have generally escaped the stigma of being in the anti-lockdown camp or lending an ear to the multitude ofconspiracy theoriessurrounding COVID-19.
Hungary's Prime MinisterViktor Orbánand Austria's ChancellorSebastian Kurz, to take two examples of prominent politicians with such leanings, have been more than willing to impose tight restrictions and stress the dangers of the virus. In fact, the country that was regarded as an outlier in the EU, Sweden, due to its no-lockdown approach (at least in terms of legal mandates), is governed by a red-green coalition that straddles the centre-left of the political spectrum. In the early phase of the health emergency one of the few dissenting political voices in the country thatpublicly questionedthe apparently hands-off manner of dealing with the crisis, in particular the decision not to close the schools, were the right-wing Swedish Democrats. While the perception among many citizens that Trump and Bolsonaro downplayed the pandemic played a large part in the shrinking of their domestic support base and probably cost the former his November 2020 presidential reelection, right-wing voices in Europe who tend to be the main drivers of Eurosceptic currents have not come to be associated with neglectful responses to the health aspects of the crisis and ineffectual strategies of mitigation.
One additional issue of paramount importance that is bound to provide fertile grounds for Eurosceptic narratives concerns the EU's exit plan for the crisis. The first steps that a government takes in tackling a national emergency are often more prone to misremembered in comparison to the measures adopted once there appears to be a clear end in sight and the crisis has entered its final stages. Recentism can be strong in the public mind, as demonstrated by thebounce in the personal ratingsof frequently maligned UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson during the month of January 2021, which has been largely courtesy of the expediency and efficiency demonstrated by the UK in administering vaccine doses to its citizens. In contrast, in recent weeks the EU has come under serious scrutiny concerning the amount of available vaccines for vulnerable citizens and the slow pace of the vaccination campaign, drawing unfavorable comparisons to non-member states such as Serbia, the UK, and Israel. The European Commission'spublic disputewith AstraZeneca pertaining to the supply of vaccines probably did little to alleviate the concerns of the European citizens that the EU officials are not really in the driving seat when it comes to paving the way for a return to pre-pandemic normalcy.
While COVID-19 may not have the markings of an existential crisis for the EU, from a theoretical standpoint it seems to tick virtually all the boxes when it comes to the potential for hardening Eurosceptic attitudes throughout the supranational community. The absence of a truly unified EU-level approach to the lock-downs, the quarantining of foreign arrivals, and a multitude of other pandemic mitigation measures set the tone for the divergent courses of action taken by the EU member states, which has ultimately resulted in COVID-19 continuing to dominate the national newspaper headlines. It remains to be seen whether the EU will be in a position to vindicate itself by demonstrating marked improvement with regard to the vaccine rollout over the coming months, though the reputational damage it has suffered will not be easy to repair.

2021-02-24,The Inevitable Rise Of Euroscepticism In Wake Of COVID-19 – OpEd,,"Mar 13, 2021( Deutsche Welle Germany: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/germany/s-1432 Delivered by Newstex)  Germany runs like clockwork — that was long the widely accepted cliche. Then came the coronavirus, and everything started crumbling. Zoran Arbutina says the wake-up call was long overdue.It's rare that anyone from my home country of Croatia asks me about everyday life in Germany. 
For the longest time I thought this was just because they had enough problems of their own to worry about.Then I realized that it actually came from their belief that they didn't have to ask because they knew enough about the country. To them — and many others around the world — Germany is a well-structured and organized country where everything works optimally. The people may be a bit reserved, but they are very disciplined. After all, it's common knowledge that German pedestrians stand and wait for the light to change before crossing deserted streets in the middle of the night.Once in a while I will tell them that's not quite how it is — for instance, the fact that the only thing you can rely on railway operator Deutsche Bahn to be is late. But then they accuse me of exaggerating, calling me a naysayer.Enter COVID-19Until recently, even Germans believed the efficiency cliche. Then came the coronavirus crisis.It started with face masks: When the decision to make them mandatory was finally made — after long, drawn-out debates about their usefulness — it became clear that there weren't enough of them available. Germany, the fourth-largest industrialized country on the planet, was then unable to secure enough supplies on global markets to make up for the shortfall. So people began sewing their own masks.When schools closed down, it quickly became evident that almost none of them could meet the technical criteria required to offer online classes.When the new academic year began in late summer, people saw — big surprise — that the virus was still there! But no one had thought to install ventilation systems while schools were empty.The same goes for well-functioning Wi-Fi systems. Digital learning platforms in several states, for instance, crashed on the first day of online schooling after schools were again forced to close in December. Many laptops earmarked for students from low-income families often went undelivered — this to children already becoming the victims of a looming education-policy catastrophe.Then came the vaccine disaster. True, the German company BioNTech was the first to offer an extremely effective coronavirus vaccine. The German government even funded the project — yet it failed to punctually order the doses it needed in sufficient quantities. The spectacular fumble segued straight into the country's poorly organized vaccination campaign: even with few doses available, many were left unused. Suddenly, Germans were looking at Serbia with envy.Germany's delusional self-imageThe latest fiasco is the confusion currently surrounding antigen tests. These were to be available in early March, before that date was pushed back. Now they're supposed to be available from mid-March. For free. But where? You can buy them at Aldi!Now, if not before, the bitter truth is beginning to show through the veneer of the smug cliche. When I talk to Croatians these days, they tend to ask: ""What's with you guys over there?""People in Germany, too, are wondering this with increasing disbelief. Their assessments of the situation range from ""not off to a smooth start,"" to ""disastrous"" and ""a total failure."" With each passing day, the splendid image the country had of itself is slowly melting away.Digital detox with Deutsche Bahn None of this is new. And this isn't just about Deutsche Bahn being the laughing stock of the nation for always running late. Take, for instance, one of the most common campaign promises in any German election: Digitalization is key to the country's future. Everyone can agree that we have to work hard to aggressively foster it — the problem is actually doing it.When, five years ago, Chinese investors bought the robotics company Kuka — a world market leader in the field — there was a huge outcry about cutting-edge German technology being sold off to foreign competitors. What critics often failed to see was that Germany lacks sufficient infrastructure to use Kuka's technology to its full extent. To this day, the 5G broadband network needed to fuel Industry 4.0 is still in its infancy in Germany.In Croatia, you have to head deep into the forests and first drive away the bears and wolves before you arrive at a place with no cell phone reception. In Germany, you just need to hop in the ICE high-speed train from Cologne to Munich. There are enough ""Funklöcher"" or ""dead spaces"" to make for an entirely relaxing trip: DB — offering digital detox with every business trip.Getting back to the front of the packMany of Germany's public authorities still send data via fax (younger readers will want to Google that). The Bundeswehr — a NATO army — has difficulty communicating within its ranks because of the myriad of software used by different sections.All of this is quite sobering for most Germans, because for them it is simply a given that Germany plays at the top of its class globally, whatever the discipline, be it building automobiles or playing soccer. Nevertheless, it doesn't seem right to overdramatize the situation either; a lot of things in Germany work better than in many places around the world. And the country is still playing in the big leagues, even if it isn't always at the front of the pack.In order to get back there, Germany will have to drop the nice but, alas, fallacious illusion of itself as a world champion organizer. A reality check is really overdue, as is a realization that being seen as just ""normal"" isn't an insult. They started doing it abroad long ago.

2021-03-13,Opinion: COVID-19 challenges German efficiency cliche,,"The World Health Organization (WHO), establish to tackle global health problems, is mobilizing for additional funds to overcome coronavirus which it declared pandemic late January 2020. The coronavirus pandemic has, undoubtedly, changed the ways of life, impacted on the capacities of health infrastructure and has disrupted the economic supply value chain with attendant negative impact on global economies.
As the world grapples with the challenges of the coronavirus, there is a need for solidarity, unity of purpose and better coordination to overcome this common enemy. In order to find long-term and sustainable solutions to the pandemic, WHO has been collaborating with the United Nations, the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, and regional organizations such as African Union, G20 and BRICS.
Besides, there is a strong cooperation in the format Russia-India-China (RIC). It is also making ways through bilateral and multilateral mechanisms. Foreign countries are contributors to the functioning of World Health Organization.
For example, U.S. is the single largest funder of the organization, providing more than $400 million each year – about 15% of its total budget. WHO has come under criticisms. Many countries especially the United States and Britain, believe that WHO's reluctance to confront China over its handling of the coronavirus outbreak is the reason it has now become a pandemic.
As the world leaders pledged to accelerate work on tests, drugs and vaccines against COVID-19 and to share them around the globe, the United States stayed away from an initiative launched on April 24 by the World Health Organization.
According to Reuters report, French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa were among those who joined a video conference to launch what the WHO billed as a ""landmark collaboration"" to fight the pandemic. Leaders from Asia, the Middle East and the Americas also joined the videoconference, but several big countries did not participate, including China, India and Russia.
The aim is to speed development of safe and effective drugs, tests and vaccines to prevent, diagnose and treat COVID-19, the lung disease caused be the novel coronavirus - and ensure equal access to treatments for both rich and poor.
""We are facing a common threat which we can only defeat with a common approach,"" WHO Director General, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, said as he opened the virtual meeting. South African leader Cyril Ramaphosa is the chair of the African Union.
Currently, Russia holds the rotating chair of BRICS. BRICS is also coordinating efforts of its members to help in finding solution to COVID-19. Russia, India and China are in very strong positions in the group or association. China and India have huge population. Despite its vast territory, Russia's population is slightly higher than Japan in the Pacific Ocean.
China, a leading global player and business footprint, said it would donate a further $30 million to the World Health Organization, which is seeking more than $1 billion to fund its battle against the coronavirus pandemic that has killed more than 180,000 people worldwide.
""At this crucial moment, supporting WHO is supporting multilateralism and global solidarity,"" Hua Chunying, spokeswoman of China's Foreign Ministry, said on Twitter.
The donation aimed to support the global fight against COVID-19, in particular strengthening health systems in developing countries, she said, adding that China had already donated $20 million to the WHO on March 11.
According to an executive decree posted to Kremlin's website, Russia will contribute $1 million to the World Health Organization (WHO) to fight the coronavirus. ""Allocate budget funding of $1 million from the federal budget for one-time voluntary contribution to the World Health Organization for coronavirus infection fight measures implementation,"" the document reads.
The same decree earmarks about $804,795 to fund expenses of the Vector Institute and the Central Research Institute of Epidemiology, ""connected to production and shipment of tools for laboratory diagnosis of the novel coronavirus infection, and material and technical support to countries of Eastern Europe, Trans-Caucasus, Central and Southeast Asia, the Middle East, Africa and South America.""
As stipulated by the guidelines, Russia assumed the rotating presidency of the BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) regional association since January, 2020. BRICS has established as a multilateral structure, and as reliable association pushing for fair, democratic and multipolar world order.
Russia continues to expand strategic partnership of the organization, working on strengthening foreign policy coordination on various multilateral platforms. Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov heads the foreign ministers of the BRICS association of countries. On April 28, this group plans to hold an extraordinary videoconference to exchange opinions on possible joint measures to oppose the coronavirus pandemic.
""At Russia's initiative, the foreign policy chiefs of the BRICS countries will hold an extraordinary conference in a video format under Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov's chairmanship on April 28,"" the Foreign Ministry said in a statement.
The foreign ministers will ""focus on aspects of the influence of the crisis prompted by the outbreak of the coronavirus infection on international relations. The ministers will exchange opinions on possible joint measures the five countries could take to oppose Covid-19 and address the financial, trade-economic, and social consequences of the pandemic,"" the statement said.
""The parties will also consider relevant aspects of the development of a five-sided strategic partnership, including a calendar of events during Russia's presidency of the BRICS this year,"" it said.
Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov said during an online launch of the Moscow-based Higher School of Economics' report on Russia's foreign policy, ""Our organization keeps an eye on the fight against COVID-19. Russia considers various aspects of the issue during its chairmanship of BRICS. Health experts maintain contacts. We will also consider various political aspects of the situation within BRICS.""
The Russian diplomat added that BRICS was an appropriate platform for such cooperation, ""given the scientific capabilities of its members, particularly in the fields of healthcare and pharmaceutical industry."" ""Each of the countries is making its own contribution to these efforts. We will bring it all together during our chairmanship so that at the end of the year we can say that BRICS has made another step forward,"" Ryabkov emphasized.
On April 23, TASS report said that BRICS member states could increase their funding of the World Health Organization and expand medical cooperation with other states due to the US decision to withdraw its contributions to the organization.
""A few days ago, the US announced that it would withdraw or suspend funding of the World Health Organization. BRICS states could make a statement, in which they would announce their increased contributions to this organization that plays a central role in the global anti-pandemic governance,"" according to Dmitry Suslov, deputy head of the Center for Comprehensive European and International Studies of the Higher School of Economics National Research University.
""BRICS states could announce further coordination in their approaches to aiding other states, states with weaker healthcare systems than those of BRICS states.""
The expert stressed that the spread of the disease in less developed countries would threaten the security of BRICS member states. Suslov, however, noted that BRICS is interested in strengthening the healthcare system in such states.
Cui Zheng, deputy head of the Research Center for the Economies and Politics of Transitional Countries at Liaoning University, expressed a similar opinion. He noted that China actively helps their partners within BRICS to combat the novel coronavirus pandemic.
""The most important thing for us is international cooperation within BRICS. The member states have clearly stated their solidarity, uniting in the fight against the coronavirus,"" the expert stated. ""Not only do China and Russia actively help each other, they are supplying materials needed to combat the coronavirus to other states.""
While coronavirus is currently the urgent task, reiterating here that, besides all, the BRICS is interested in increasing financial and economic cooperation among the participating countries, effective industrial interaction and practical cooperation in developing and implementing new joint energy, telecommunications and high-tech projects.
The coronavirus disease appeared first in 2019 in Wuhan city in China. The disease was, first identified in Wuhan and Hubei, both in China early December 2019. The original cause still unknown, it remains a puzzle and an enigma for the world scientific community.
Since then, cases of the novel coronavirus - named COVID-19 by the WHO - have spread around the world. According to the latest statistics, over 2,700,000 people have been infected worldwide and more than 191,000 deaths have been reported.
In addition, so far, over 750,000 individuals have recovered from the illness across the globe.
The BRICS member countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa) collectively represent about 26% of the world's geographical area and are home to 3.6 billion people, about 42% of the world's population and a combined nominal GDP of $16.6 trillion.

2020-04-26,"Understanding BRICS, WHO And COVID-19 – OpEd",,"By Joseph Sunde*
Before the COVID-19 crisis began, America was already facing a severeloneliness epidemic– marked by decades-long increases insuicideandchronic lonelinessand declines inmarriage and community attachment. Now, amid flurries of sweeping lockdowns, the struggle has become harder still, pushing any remnants of embodied community deeper into the confines of social media.
We are facing a ""social recession,"" argues the Manhattan Institute'sMichael Hendrix, driven by a mix of stress over public health, economic anxiety, and the isolating effects of physical distancing. ""Disasters often have a way of bringing communities together,"" he writes. ""But not this pandemic. The twisted logic of contagion means that safety comes through suffering alone. The places with the strongestsocial tiesand greatestconnectivityare the most vulnerable to the spread of Covid-19.""
Drawing from anew surveyfrom the Centers for Disease Control, he summarizes the scene as follows:
More than 40 percent of [survey] respondents reported some form of adverse mental or behavioral health this June, with symptoms of depression and anxiety up three and four times their 2019 levels, respectively. A quarter of young adults (ages 18 to 24) said they had considered suicide in the past 30 days, and a similar share say they are turning to drink and drugs to cope with the emotional toll of the pandemic.
The CDC's shocking findings are echoed elsewhere. Since the coronavirus pandemic began, more than one third of Americans havereported sufferingfrom severe anxiety. Fifty-five percent of those who have experienced financial hardship during the pandemic report the same. Today, just 14 percent of American adultssay they'revery happy, down from nearly one third in 2018. And half of Americans say they feel isolated. No wonder that so many Americans also say the coronavirus pandemic is harming their mental health. Texts to a federal mental health hotlinejumpedby 1,000 percent in April year-on-year. Suspected drugoverdosesrose by 18 percent in March, 29 percent in April, and 42 percent in May. And Covid-19 is still wreaking havoc on our lives and livelihoods. America is facing a public health crisis, an economic crisis, and a mental health crisis all in one.
In response, policymakers have proved predictably inept, relying on a tired mix ofso-called stimulusandmonetarist tweaksto curb the economic pain, all while demonizing those who attempt to gather in public – even those who adhered to the politicians' protocols. As has becomeparticularly evidentin the debates over school closures, even those who acknowledge the problem are not willing to take any risks to address it. Even whenpublic health officialsand theAmerican Academy of Pediatricswere keen to bring the issue to the forefront, all it took wasa few chirps from public-sector unionsfor all social side effects to become secondary line-item concerns.
Rather than acknowledging the full range of health risks at play – physical, mental, emotional, spiritual, and otherwise – our political class has opted for overemphasis on an excessively narrow set of concerns. Paired with the hum-drum incompetence we have come to expect from our governing officials, the cultural conversation has become misaligned on multiple fronts.
""Unfortunately,"" Hendrix observes, ""most our public leaders know far better how to pull a fiscal lever than to replenish social capital – or even tocoordinatecontact tracing, mass testing, selective quarantines, vaccine prizes, or other such signs of effective leadership during a pandemic.""
Those frustrations loom large. Yet outside of lifting restrictions or implementing effective testing regimes, policy will have plenty of limits when it comes to curbing loneliness. In turn, we would do well to direct our attention elsewhere. Hendrix points to the example of Hurricane Katrina, after which many survivors experienced severe emotional stress (known as""Katrina brain""), reminding us how ""the city's deep-rooted community helped many cope and recover."" According toNew York University historian Jacob Remes, who studied the aftermath in New Orleans, ""Dense social networks in communities save people. That's what makes communities resilient, and it's what then helps communities recover.""
What we need, it would appear, is renewed intentionality and innovation in actual, true community – not reactive resistance to the fruits of freedom, but faithful stewardship of each new blessing and opportunity as it arises. The idols of modernity have long tempted us towardisolation and individualism, but when it comes to this, the pandemic may serve as a wake-up call, helping us prioritize human connection where it's currently lacking – and see and appreciate itwhere it already exists.
This can occureven amid our current season of social distancing, as we have already seen across a number of spheres. Churches are innovating new ways of bringing people together and communicating the Gospel, challenging traditional constraints and demonstrating the value of embodied spiritual community. The increasing acceptance of virtual schooling is leading towidespread migrationto homeschooling, neighborhood co-ops, and private institutions – all of which is sure to inspirenew paradigms of community and connectionoutside of our stagnant, postwar bureaucracies. In the workplace, many are now making do with ""virtual happy hours,"" but more importantly, they are starting to realize that social connection is, indeed,a large part of economic lifeand always has been. In neighborhoods like my own, less interaction in public spaces has led each of us to deepen connections with our neighbors – creating ""isolation cells"" in small platoons as a way of coping with loneliness elsewhere.
As Hendrix explains, before and beyond any policy solutions, we need an attentiveness to human and community needs. Our hearts must place loving our neighbors over and above the temptation of narrow isolation and self-protection:
The charge to every American during this pandemic of Covid-19 should be to ask ""What particular role is my community asking me to play?"" It could be to serve, to give, to care, or to cure. Of course, the elites of our communities and our country have a unique role to play in helping combat the virus and restoring our civic health. But each of us also has a civic responsibility to seek the best for our neighbors without expecting anything in return.
Much of this is due to our current season, yes. But with continued investment, the revival of America's civic fabric may be closer than it's been in recent decades. ""In the meantime,"" Hendrix concludes, ""we must all do our part to sustain what binds us together: our families, faith, friends, and work, and every other such institution. These are the binding threads of America's social fabric, and we are the weavers. And, however weakened and frayed, they are what will carry us through this crisis together.""
We are called to ahigher freedomthan the isolationism of our age, one that fully and actively embodies the space between individual and state, but not only as a means to a political end or public-health objective. It is up to us, then, to be the moral witnesses of such freedom, investing in our neighbors and communities and tackling the challenge of loneliness where it begins.

2020-09-06,How To Beat The 'Social Recession' Of COVID-19 – OpEd,,"May 01, 2020( Ventureburn: http://ventureburn.com Delivered by Newstex)  Attracting media attention to a pivotal part of your technology startup's journey can be challenging even during normal times. This is especially for technical founders who may be great at discussing their product details among engineers but do not know where to begin when trying to convince a journalist they have a story worth sharing. But needless to say, these are not normal times. Journalists are working double time, industries are rapidly evolving, and no one knows what the future holds. 
Founders need to understand the best way to pitch journalists during this pandemic because drawing the right attention, at the right time, can play an instrumental part in the success of your company. Journalists are being bombarded with press releases and pitches about companies' 'unique' response to Covid-19 I recently spoke with four top media companies covering African tech startup news and asked for advice on behalf of startups trying to get media attention during Covid-19. Here's a summary of what I've learned:1. Covid-washing can hurt your credibilityJournalists are being bombarded with press releases and pitches about companies' 'unique' response to Covid-19. Stephen Timm, editor at Ventureburn referred to it as 'Covid-washing'#8212; something that everyone I spoke to echoed their frustration with in one way or another. The reality is, every company is responding and adapting to Covid-19 because you have to in order to survive. This doesn't make you unique and journalists can tell right away if you're trying to use the pandemic as your cornerstone just to get media attention. This is a poor choice in strategy and you may end up hurting your credibility with a journalist. Tip: Make sure your story is moving the conversation about Covid forward. Ask yourself, how will the African and global tech audience significantly benefit from the news I'm sharing?2. Journalists can still smell your BSTech journalists are working overtime right now from the prisons of their own homes. Exhausted and isolated, their investigative journalistic instincts are very much still intact. Timm commented that tech venture news is often 'full of hot air'. The Ventureburn editor shared that 'you have to take an investigative approach because founders either don't know how to share their story well or are trying to inflate the importance of their story. So I always pick up the phone and dig deeper.' Not all journalists are as generous with their time and willing to pick up the phone. If they are, make sure you can back up your claims and are not wasting you're or the journalist's time. The good ones will keep digging until they find the truth.3.Make it easy for journalists to do due diligenceJake Bright, a TechCrunch[1] journalist who covers African tech news, shared that he can usually tell from the subject line, or a two to three second email scan, if there is a story worth sharing or not. His advice for founders whose pitches don't end up in the trash folder? Make it as easy as possible for journalists to verify your credibility. Here are the tips he shared: Make sure your company's Crunchbase[2] profile is up to date. This is often the first place journalists look to verify your legitimacy. They're looking for funding history and previous content written about you. Promote relationships with your venture capital investors. Consider adding 'venture-backed' to your company bio or on your website if you're an early stage company. Build relationships with other credible players in the space who are able to make referrals.4.Journalists are humans tooThey have hopes, dreams and bosses they have to report to. Adewale Yusef's, CEO of TechPoint.Africa[3], advice for startups is to 'talk to journalists like they're humans and always keep in mind that journalists are looking for the best story to pitch to their editorial team'. Yusef also wanted founders to realise, 'journalists are always, always looking for stories. Good stories.' This means that if a journalist turned your story down in the past, it's because they weren't confident enough to bring it in front of their editorial team. This rejection shouldn't keep you from pitching an even better story in the future.5.Bring the field to themJournalists are being impacted by lack of opportunities for informal conversations with industry stakeholders. They usually rely on, in part, informal conversations during conferences, coffees, and happy hours to stay abreast of industry trends. Kay Ugwuede, journalist at TechCabal[4], shared that while 'virtual interviews have been surprisingly effective journalists are still definitely feeling more removed from what's really going on.' Now is a great time for startups to try and build a relationship with a journalist by sharing insider insight into their industry. Try sending an email saying 'I saw you've been writing about X, my company Y has boots on the ground in location Z. Let me know if you're interested in having a brief call to discuss what we've been learning.' Even if it doesn't turn into a story, you've now made a new genuine connection with a journalist in your field.6.Do your homeworkYou're busy, journalists are busy, we're all busy. But journalists are even busier now due to the pandemic. Spend 10-15 minutes of time researching a journalist before you pitch them. You can easily tell from previous articles what journalists are interested in covering. Also, take a quick look at their social media channels to learn how they prefer to be contacted. I was surprised to learn that editorial teams actually read and respond to their general inboxes. For example: editor@ventureburn.com, news@techpoint.africa, startups@techpoint.africa, or editor@techcabal.com; Tip: Email is never a bad idea because it allows journalists to easily forward your pitch to other members of their team who may be more interested in your story. Understanding the fundamentals of pitching to journalists remains a critical part of the process of getting your story into mainstream African tech news. So, nail the fundamentals but also understand how the field of journalism is adapting to Covid-19. Use this knowledge to sharpen your company narrative and how it relates to the pandemic, establish credibility, and build relationships. *Belle Raab is a Platform Manager at the impact investing firm Factor[e] Ventures.

2020-05-01,How African tech startups can pitch their story during Covid-19 [Opinion],,"With the worldwide spread of the pandemic COVID-19, the operations of e-commerce retail hit a road bump, this outbreak has not only threatened the human life but also switching on a red signal to the virtual business, given the weeks and months-long lockdown imposed in many countries across the world, the day to day business operations of the online retails hit a stumbling block in terms of fall in their customer size and the downward sweep of the financial performance.
On March 15, Flipkart, one of the biggest E-commerce company, proclaimed a temporary suspension of its business operations in view of the 21-day long nationwide lockdown in India because of the outbreak of COVID-19. The website of Flipkart went on for a temporary break showing "" Hello fellow Indians, We are temporarily suspending operations. Your needs have always been our priority and our promise is that we will be back to serve you, as soon as possible,"" as an emergency message. With the extension of the lockdown in India, Flipkart's official website further added to its previous message ""These are difficult times, times like no other. Never before, have communities stayed apart to stay safe, never before, has been at home meant helping the nation's safety. We urge you to stay home to stay safe. We will get there. And we will get through. Together.""
However, according to the media reports, the delivery of food items, pharmaceuticals, and medical equipment have been exempted from the lockdown, still, the halt in the supply-chain has caused a depressing situation both for the online retails and the prospect customers. the spread of the pandemic has not only dented the E-commerce in India, but the brunt of the outbreak is also borne worldwide by the online retails and is becoming uncontrollable as the days pass by. On April 10, Amazon suspended shipping its typical products, nevertheless, the company continued shipping safety and hygienic items to the people such as masks and cleaning equipment, ""our top concern is the health and safety of our employees. We made over 150 process updates to help protect employees, from enhanced cleaning and social distancing measures to piloting new efforts like using disinfectant fog in our New York fulfillment center,"" a tagline note by Amazon.
The findings of a recently conducted research reveal that the degree to which the general public has avoided flocking to crowded places depends on the severity of the outbreak in each country. For example, as of March 2020, according to a statistical survey conducted by You Go, 85% of internet users in China and 83% of those in Hong Kong have expressed that, they had avoided crowded public places in the past two weeks. Just more than a quarter (27%) of those in the US and 14% in the UK said the same. With such facts, as much as people avoid going outside, the trend line of the supply-chain for many E-commerce firms will collapse.
With the swiftness in continuous rise of COVID-19, other web-based businesses such as intellectual property and consulting firms have also witnessed a detrimental change in terms of consumer loss, as there have already been evident hints of negative change in the behavior of consumers, the virtual business firms fear the aftermath caused by COVID-19. Self-quarantines and escalating concerns about roaming outside in public places or delivering items other than safety equipment result in the loss of customers for many retail.

At such a critical moment in the global fight against COVID-19, we are gathered together in this Extraordinary China-Africa Summit. Friends old and new are connected via video link to discuss our joint response to COVID-19 and to renew the fraternity between China and Africa. I thank President Ramaphosa and President Sall for joining me in initiating the Summit, and I appreciate the participation of all colleagues present. I also want to send my regards to other African leaders who are not able to be with us today.The sudden onslaught of COVID-19 has taken a heavy toll on countries around the world, with the loss of several hundred thousand precious lives. 
Here, I suggest that we observe a moment of silence for those who have tragically passed away due to COVID-19 and express our condolences to their families.- In the face of COVID-19, China and Africa have withstood the test of a severe challenge. The Chinese people have put up a fierce fight and made enormous sacrifice to bring the situation in China under control. Still, we remain mindful of the risk of resurgence. In the same spirit, governments and peoples in Africa have put up a united front and, under the effective coordination by the African Union, have taken strong measures to effectively slow the spread of the virus. These are indeed hard-won results.- In the face of COVID-19, China and Africa have offered mutual support and fought shoulder to shoulder with each other. China shall always remember the invaluable support Africa gave us at the height of our battle with the coronavirus. In return, when Africa was struck by the virus, China was the first to rush in with assistance and has since stood firm with the African people.- In the face of COVID-19, China and Africa have enhanced solidarity and strengthened friendship and mutual trust. Let me reaffirm China's commitment to its longstanding friendship with Africa. No matter how the international landscape may evolve, China shall never waver in its determination to pursue greater solidarity and cooperation with Africa.Colleagues,We must mobilize necessary resources, stick together in collaboration, and do whatever it takes to protect people's lives and health and minimize the fallout of COVID-19.First, we must stay committed to fighting COVID-19 together. China will lose no time in following through on the measures I announced at the opening of the World Health Assembly, and continue to help African countries by providing supplies, sending expert teams, and facilitating Africa's procurement of medical supplies in China. China will start ahead of schedule the construction of the Africa CDC headquarters this year. China will work with Africa to fully deliver the health care initiative adopted at the FOCAC Beijing Summit, and speed up the construction of China-Africa Friendship Hospitals and the cooperation between paired-up Chinese and African hospitals. Together, we will build a China-Africa community of health for all. We pledge that once the development and deployment of COVID-19 vaccine is completed in China, African countries will be among the first to benefit.Second, we must stay committed to enhancing China-Africa cooperation. To cushion the impact of COVID-19, it is important to strengthen Belt and Road cooperation and accelerate the follow-ups to the FOCAC Beijing Summit. Greater priority needs to be given to cooperation on public health, economic reopening, and people's livelihood.Within the FOCAC framework, China will cancel the debt of relevant African countries in the form of interest-free government loans that are due to mature by the end of 2020. For those African countries that are hardest hit by the coronavirus and are under heavy financial stress, China will work with the global community to give them greater support, by such means as further extending the period of debt suspension, to help them tide over the current difficulty. China hopes that the international community, especially developed countries and multilateral financial institutions, will act more forcefully on debt relief and suspension for Africa. To help Africa achieve sustainable development is what matters in the long run. China supports Africa in its effort to develop the African Continental Free Trade Area and to enhance connectivity and strengthen industrial and supply chains. China will explore broader cooperation with Africa in such new business forms as digital economy, smart city, clean energy, and 5G to boost Africa's development and revitalization.Third, we must stay committed to upholding multilateralism. In the face of COVID-19, solidarity and cooperation is our most powerful weapon. China will work with Africa to uphold the UN-centred global governance system and support WHO in making greater contribution to the global COVID-19 response. We oppose politicization and stigmatization of COVID-19, and we oppose racial discrimination and ideological bias. We stand firm for equity and justice in the world.Fourth, we must stay committed to taking China-Africa friendship forward. The world is undergoing profound changes unseen in a century. Given the new opportunities and challenges we face, closer cooperation between China and Africa is needed, more than ever. On my part, I will stay in close touch with all of you, my colleagues, to consolidate our friendship and mutual trust, support each other on issues involving our respective core interests, and advance the fundamental interests of China and Africa and, for that matter, of all developing countries. This way, we will be able to take the China-Africa comprehensive strategic and cooperative partnership to a greater height.Colleagues,At the FOCAC Beijing Summit, we agreed to work together to build an even stronger China-Africa community with a shared future. Today's Extraordinary China-Africa Summit on Solidarity against COVID-19 is our concrete step to deliver the commitment we made at the Beijing Summit and to do our part in the international cooperation against COVID-19. I am convinced that humanity will ultimately defeat the virus, and that the Chinese and African people are poised to embrace better days ahead.

2020-06-17,Opinion| Defeating COVID-19 with Solidarity and Cooperation,,"Manila, March 5 -- The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is now looking to transport more coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines outside the National Capital Region (NCR) using its various land, air, and naval transport assets.
AFP chief-of-staff Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, in a statement Friday, said this is now being coordinated with the Department of Health (DOH) as regards to the protocol on handling and storage of the vaccines.
""We are one with the government and the Health Department in the full force implementation of the National Vaccine Deployment Program. I am urging all members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines to join this effort so that we will be able to convey to our people the need for their cooperation in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic,"" he added.
On Friday, a Philippine Air Force C-295 medium transport aircraft transported 600 vials of Covid-19 vaccines from Villamor Airbase, Pasay City to the Lumbia Airfield in Cagayan de Oro City.
It was then escorted by military and medical personnel to its destination at the 4th Infantry Division at its headquarters in Camp Evangelista. The vials were the first batch of vaccines that were delivered by the military outside the NCR.
Around 100 out of the 300 front-liners assigned at the 4th Infantry Division were inoculated during the ceremonial vaccination.

2021-03-05,AFP readies more transport ops for Covid-19 jabs,,"The COVID-19 pandemic is arguably one of the biggest disruptors to modern day life as we know it. The economic and social disruption caused by the pandemic is devastating; millions of people have lost their lives, tens of millions of people are at risk of falling into extreme poverty and nearly half of the global work force is at risk of losing their livelihoods. Africa is facing its first economic recession in 25 years due to the impact of the pandemic.
In a continent where agriculture accounts for 23% of the GDP and about 40% of the workforce is engaged in the sector, agriculture has not been spared from the worst impacts of the pandemic.
Across the globe, it has been inspiring to see prior investments in empowering women-led agribusiness begin to pay off--and that the measures have enabled women farmers to contribute to the fight against COVID-19. This could be the case for Africa too
Border closures, trade restrictions and confinement measures have been preventing farmers from accessing inputs such as seeds and fertilizers, markets and agricultural workers from harvesting crops, thus disrupting domestic and international food supply chains and reducing access to healthy, safe and diverse diets.
Through all this, about 50% of the global population has been disproportionately affected by the pandemic, women.
The pandemic has exacerbated existing structural economic, social, and technological inequalities that women face as they struggle to perform their multiple roles in society. These inequalities undermine women's capacity to respond and recover from the disruptions that result from the pandemic. Women are a key pillar in the Africa's food and agricultural systems.
They constitute 50% of the agricultural workforce and own one-third of the small and medium enterprises (SME's) that produce, process and trade in agricultural products and services. The pandemic not only affected their livelihoods and agri-business enterprises, but also increased women's workloads, threatened their families' wellbeing, and increase incidences of gender-based violence.
As we commemorate the International Women's Day this year, we are acutely aware that as the narrative now shifts to building back better, we must ensure that women are at the center of short term and longer term recovery efforts to create a more equal and resilient society.
Over the course of my career as an agricultural economist and development practitioner and, I have seen the change that can be realized when women receive the support, they need during times such as these. A growing body of evidence demonstrates the power of interventions designed for and targeted to women in agriculture that can help protect their lives and livelihoods in the context of the COVID-19 pandemic.
African governments need to design and support such interventions. This means providing avenues for continued access to inputs such as seeds, fertilizers, pesticides, mechanization and advisory services. It also means women accessing knowledge and skills to make best outcome of their labour inputs.
As economies open after months of lockdowns and restricted movement, access to financing, grants for those that closed due to pandemic and flexible loans for those that kept going albeit in a small way- is key for recovery. Accessing high value markets is an important factor, not only for recovery, but for higher incomes that help build financial resilience in women's agri-enterprises.
During the pandemic, digital services have provided a crucial lifeline for businesses. Women business managers have used social media to market their products while accessing information on production, weather and agronomic advisories, financing and accessing markets. Deploying digital capacity building at scale and increasing women entrepreneurs' participation in the digital economy through digital finance, digital marketing and digital trade is key as we rebuild economies.
Initiatives such as VALUE4HER, a platform whose aim is to increase incomes and employment opportunities for women by linking women-led agribusinesses with competitive high value regional and global markets, and improving women business leader's technical and managerial skills, with training on market dynamics are key to growing women-owned agribusinesses further.
Currently hosting over 750 users from 36 countries across the continent, the platform provides real-time access to relevant knowledge, market information, buyers, financiers, business development services, technical assistance, capabilities and social networks.
These services hosted under one roof provide a conducive ecosystem for female owned agribusinesses to access the tools they need to become profitable businesses.
Also key is providing tailored training and capacity building for women to respond, recover, and build resilience. With low literacy levels and limited networks, women's access to relevant information and support mechanisms is curtailed.
Programs such as the African Resilience Investment Series for Women Executives (ARISE), which AGRA kicks off today in celebration of international women's day- seeks to equip women-owned and women-led SMEs with the necessary tools and practical management skills, needed to recover from the impact of COVID-19 pandemic.
Across the globe, it has been inspiring to see prior investments in empowering women-led agribusiness begin to pay off--and that the measures have enabled women farmers to contribute to the fight against COVID-19. This could be the case for Africa too. Investing in women makes good business sense; it leads to increased incomes for women and boosts the wellbeing of their families, which means better lives for families, communities and society as a whole.

2021-03-06,Women Are the Future of Africa's Covid-19 Recovery [opinion],,"A coronavirus recession in Liberia is inevitable. COVID-19 commonly known as the coronavirus could lay siege and overwhelm critical socioeconomic sectors in the country. The pandemic poses an existential threat to public health as much as an unprecedented socioeconomic danger to every Liberian. Urgent actions desperately need to be taken to mitigate the severe impact of the pandemic. Like most other countries in the Global South, Liberia, has gotten a reprieve from COVID-19 since the outbreak of the pandemic ravaged China and now spreading across Europe and the United States. 
The country's grace period was over on March 13 when a government official returned from Europe and tested positive for the virus; paired with transmission to others and successive positive testing of visitors to the country. The shock of COVID-19 to the Liberian economy will be enormously dire. Therefore, the spread of the pandemic in Liberia should not be taken lightly because the worst is yet to come. The unprecedented socioeconomic depression of COVID-19 will sooner or later reach deep into the country's major commodity trade in rubber, iron ore, gold, diamond and raw timber; further dragging down GDP growth and depressing economic performance in public spending, employment, food security, tropical markets, retailing, transportation and supply chain sectors. This will exacerbate livelihood and living conditions to uncontrollable proportions exposing and highlighting the country's structural inequality, social exclusion, marginalization, wealth imbalances and workforce underdevelopment. It could indeed be far worse than the country's two bloody civil wars.
The public health and social based intervention deployed by the George Weah-led CDC government may be ineffective and impracticable due to framework and timetable implementation strategy issues. Liberia needs more vehement education with accurate public health information propagation to protect and safeguard families and local communities from the spread of COVID-19. Training of volunteers, religious and traditional leaders, coupled with community and civic organizations on surveillance for COVID-19 case management and infection prevention need to immediately be put into effect by going door-to-door to proactively widen factual public health awareness. It is also critical to explain the importance of social distancing, sheltering-in-place, self-quarantining, and adequate WASH (water, sanitation and hygiene) to access safe running water for drinking, cooking, hand-washing with soap and sanitation. Prevention against the spread of COVID-19 is the best way that the George Weah-led CDC government can protect the Liberian people against the spread of COVID-19. Furthermore, the government needs to ensure the availability of ample stockpile of medical and laboratory supplies; including, pharmaceuticals and medical equipment, disinfectants for medical waste management and personal protective equipment (PPE) for both healthcare workers and public safety personnel.
The response and action of the George Weah-led CDC government will determine how deep the economic shock is, how long it lasts, and how rapidly the economy bounces back. The pandemic is on a trajectory of uncertainty with the possibility of provoking sweeping slump across the economy with the propensity of producing a vicious downward spiral that could ruthlessly distress every Liberian man woman and child. When the Ebola virus erupted in 2014, out of the reported 11,325 deaths that occurred in the sub-region, over 6,500 innocent souls were Liberians, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Accordingly, the George Weah-led CDC government must now awaken to the enormous threat that COVID-19 poses to Liberia, and formulate and implement innovative policy initiative and structural guidelines to curb the spread of the pandemic. Liberia is one of the least equipped countries in the sub-region to combat COVID-19 on its own due to its weak healthcare delivery system that has completely been abandoned over the past two years.
Certainly, Liberia will face a catastrophe should the COVID-19 outbreak becomes widespread in rural townships and densely populated peri-urban communities. This could very likely lead to the collapse of the CDC government, and it demise will solely be due to inaction and incompetence. Hitherto, a handful of COVID-19 cases have been reported in the country, and while these cases remain extremely low, there is absolutely no place or time for officials to masquerade and exhibit arrogance by patronizing and encouraging privilege, favoritism and corruption, whilst censoring and mistreating poor, underprivileged and vulnerable Liberians. Calming and enlightening the Liberian people on ways to mitigate the socioeconomic shocks of the virus is imperative.
Additionally, health workers in densely populated peri-urban communities and rural townships needs to be educated and trained on best practices in hygiene promotion, regular hand washing with soap, social distancing; shelter in place and self-quarantine to mitigate the spread of the virus. Consequently, tangible preparations to mitigate the inevitable socioeconomic disaster must come from the leadership. The George Weah-led CDC government must utilize and improve the community disease surveillance health systems formulated during the 2014 Ebola virus crisis to defeat the spread of COVID-19 by ensuring extensive and equitably testing, treatment and service delivery across the country. The apex of COVID-19 is on course of ripping through the Liberian economy ruthlessly disrupting critical sectors like, public spending, import-export trade, employment, healthcare system, retail, tourism, remittances, livelihood, consumer spending, food security, smallholder farmers, petty trading, community selling and transportation; all of which could further depress socioeconomic performance by dragging down GDP growth, causing redundancy to uncontrollably swell out of proportion.
COVID-19 will account for the lack of critical supplies in the country's regional and neighborhood tropical markets. A drag on the supply chain sector will impact livelihoods, consumer goods and the businesses sector causing Liberians to scramble for alternatives that may be extremely challenging. Moreover, the Liberian workforce will indeed feel the excruciating pain of COVID-19. Health workers, smallholder farmers, market-women, merchants, vendors, traders, building trades and construction workers will dangerously run low on finding work, obtaining equipment, supplies and goods. Consequently, the George Weah CDC-led CDC government cannot remain dormant and complaisant. The government must carefully reflect upon the significant impact that COVID-19 could inflict upon the country, not to mention the irregularity and unconventional behavior that could lay siege to livelihood and well-being.
President George Weah needs to formulate and implement policies to reboot the economy. This means, effective and innovative governance on demand with genuineness and all hands on deck to defeat COVID-19. Widespread outbreak of COVID-19 in poor rural and peri-urban communities will progressively speed towards an uncontrollable socioeconomic cataclysm. Consequently, early warning and rapid response systems needs to be established to prevent the spread of COVID-19. Similarly, ample medical equipment, supplies and power to guarantee uninterrupted flow of electricity to hospitals, clinics and community health centers must be provided. Actions undertaken in the West African sub-region and internationally cannot simply be duplicated or blindly followed without streamlining specific benefits to Liberia. Public hand-washing facilities in public markets, transport depots, business districts, institutions, municipal buildings and community centers needs to be constructed in order to flatten the curve and minimize the spread of COVID-19. This includes extensive circulation of information throughout local community to prevent those infected from infecting family members and the community at large. Official policies need to be broadcast in traditional languages and colloquial speech to debunk and keep misinformation from spreading as is customary in Liberia due to the prevalence of illiteracy.
Liberia needs resiliency to fight the COVID-19 pandemic through a national mobilization effort. There needs to be instructions on ways to prevent COVID-19 from spreading. The George Weah-led CDC government has a wide window to really make a difference in the lives of Liberians and the economy. The government cannot just imitate other societies or blindly follow global directives simply to take advantage of international institutional funding to line the pockets of George Weah and his friends and cronies. If the George Weah-led CDC government wavers in any way-shape-or-form, the opposition should be ready to force the hand of the government whenever an iota of neglect occurs in addressing pertinent issues and concerns of the Liberian people regarding COVID-19. COVID-19 should strengthen and unite all Liberians. The opposition should not allow George Weah to use the virus to tilt the playing field in his favor, especially regarding suppressing critique, evaluation of how the government handles the virus. Moreover, President George Weah should not be allowed politization of COVID-19 through the use of paramilitary force, public rhetoric to intimidate, or songs to deceive, and cheering rallies to give the wrong impression will not suffice for what is yet to come.
Congratulations to all personnel of the Ministry of Health, the National Public Health Institute, and the Chief Medical Officer of Liberia for the excellent job, professionalism and leadership demonstrated during the challenging period of the COVID-19 pandemic.

2020-04-06,Mitigating Socioeconomic Impact of COVID-19 [opinion],,"The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a great deal of vulnerabilities in our world and our way of life that we never imagined we had. But in this time, technology has revealed itself to be an invaluable tool to help us to continue to meet our basic needs even as we stay home and socially distanced. Whether it is e-education for our kids, tools to help us work from home, or services that allow us to get the products that we need to survive, our reliance on technology has deepened during the pandemic, and it has accelerated the technology takeover.
The Four Stages of Pandemic Behavior
The patterns of altered behavior brought about by the virus can be divided into four stages. The Danger Zone is the period when the country goes into lockdown to try to contain the virus and flatten the curve. What follows this is the New Normal; the period in which countries try to open up a little again while continuing to keep schools closed, work from home and maintain social distancing. After that, we have the period when we adapt to the virus, we start to go back to more normal lives because we have developed a deeper understanding of how to live with the virus. Finally, after a vaccine is discovered, scaled and distributed, our behavior can return to how it was before the virus.
Post Vaccine Period: Return to normal 
We have seen different companies react to this period differently, and we can predict certain trends going forward:
These companies can broadly be divided into four groups. The first are those completely unable to operate in the danger zone, such as companies in the travel, hospitality and ride sharing industries. These companies have suffered during the pandemic predominantly because the industries that they operate rely on direct services to people.
The second group are companies with low long-term stickiness. Companies that prop themselves up during the pandemic by creating a simple business that can address the needs created by the pandemic. They take advantage of the space left open by large companies that struggle to react to the crisis rapidly or effectively. Ultimately, these companies are unable to hold onto all the market share given due to a customer experience that is lacking. Larger players also catch up as the pandemic eases. Companies like small grocers making home deliveries, WhatsApp-run businesses, etc. fall into this category.
Then, there are businesses with high stickiness. These businesses see an increased patronage during the lockdown, and only experience a small drop when it ends. Ultimately, the momentum gained through the new customers won during the lockdown may allow them to continue to grow their customer base, even after the lockdown ends. These include video conferencing software like Zoom, online retailers like Walmart or Amazon, and paid online streaming services like Netflix. Companies like this may thrive as they are well positioned to provide good customer digital experiences and only increase market share from pre-COVID19 situations.
The biggest successes of all though are those new outliers whose business is based on changing consumer behaviors. Once behavior has been changed due to the lockdown, they feel far more comfortable continuing to operate that way post-lockdown. These companies include gaming company PUBG and last-mile delivery companies like China's Meituan, that have reached a $100 billion valuation during the crisis.
Two Sri Lankan companies that succeeded well in this environment are PickMe Delivery and oDoc. oDoc, a company that provides telemedicine software, saw a 374% increase in new customer registrations during the lockdown period in March growing at 10% per day. They became the official telemedicine provider for the government of Sri Lanka and released an online COVID-19 symptoms checker. While patients may opt for physical consultations in post-pandemic, the adoption of video-based consultations has increased, and some patients - now having experienced both options - may now prefer the convenience of telemedicine.
The Digitization Acceleration
So just how much has digitization increased? According to Forbes, e-commerce retail orders in the US have increased by 146% while revenue has increased by 68% during this pandemic. Amazon and Walmart have both reached their highest market caps to date at $1.23 Trillion and $376.54 Billion respectively. But it isn't just retail where e-commerce has exploded. If this trend continues, US online grocery sales are set to double by 2021 from $14.2 Billion to $29.7 Billion.
With 1.2 billion children outside the classroom, e-learning services have grown too. Google Classroom alone has experienced a 150% increase in its user base, and this is all on top of a pre-pandemic prediction that Forbes made; forecasting that the e-learning market would reach $325 Billion by 2025.
The digitization of banking has seen a significant change as well. In many countries, the use of ATMs has dropped by 60% while 63% of customers have been inclined to try out their bank's mobile application.
The rise of online gaming has been a major trend with the annual revenue generated through online gaming reaching $18 Billion. Leading games like Fortnite are earning over $2 Billion annually. Usage is up during the pandemic as the amount of non-virtual entertainment available declines.
The AI and Automation acceleration that we have been witnessing over the last few years has only accelerated during the pandemic. The use of AI to handle unforeseen loads in critical situations has been useful during the pandemic, as chat-bots have dealt with high traffic in the healthcare sector and beyond. The deployment of robotics in supply chain management has also allowed work to proceed with indirect physical involvement from human employees.
The Shorter Supply Chain
Another change that we have seen in this pandemic situation is the shortening of the supply chain. To get products to struggling consumers faster, companies have focused on simplifying their sales process and causing a merging of the B2B and B2C supply chains. Many businesses in the middle of the chain are brick and mortar establishments that have not been able to remain open in the midst of the pandemic, so manufacturers and suppliers are selling directly to consumers online. For example, Chinese cosmetics company Lin Qingxuan closed 40% of their retail outlets and converted their in-store sales staff to online influencers.
Changes to How Businesses Run
In addition to these industry level changes, it is likely that we will see changes to how businesses operate internally. Many companies were afraid to allow their employees to work remotely, fearing drops in productivity and efficiency. However, as the pandemic spread; 88% of employers encouraged their teams to work from home. Companies found that in most cases productivity did not decrease meaningfully; provided the employee had the prerequisite hardware tools at their disposal and the company had the necessary cloud architecture.
Remote work has increased so much that business apps which facilitate it reached 62 million downloads from 14-21 March, their biggest week ever. Video calls over Microsoft Teams have increased by 1000% and Zoom has reached a market capitalization of $48.78 Billion as usage went up by 3000%.
This has increased the belief in the effectiveness of working remotely. Now, remote work can mean something as simple as employees commuting less to the office, but it can have deeper consequences too. Many startups and small companies may forgo the need to have physical premises, relying on co-working spaces that can be rented out by the hour for days when they need to have meetings, and having their teams work remotely the rest of the time. Remote work can also mean that the hiring pools of companies have suddenly become global, as the geography in which your team members are located ceases to be a major consideration.
Along with this comes greater investment in cloud architecture. The use of cloud platforms to allow team members to work collaboratively regardless of where they are has proven its worth in the pandemic, and the lessons learned will continue to be valuable in a post-pandemic world.
The Strategic Role of the CTO/CIO
The role of the CTO/CIO has been traditionally seen as a support role, serving the needs of the core business. But as companies deepen the use of technology to meet customer needs, the role of the head of technology in companies will gain greater importance. CTOs and CIOs have been key players in responding to this crisis, leading the teams that have allowed business to continue to operate where possible, and creating new digital possibilities for doing business where necessary.
As more of the workforce becomes remote and the reliance on cloud infrastructure deepens, more of the workload will be handled online, increasing security concerns that this data could be hacked. It will be the responsibility of the CTO/CIOs to both spearhead this cloud transformation and ensure that it happens safely.
CTOs/CIOs will also have to play a leading role in guiding the way their organizations face future trends. The emphasis on analyzing data from within the organization and data on how the organization interacts with its external stakeholders will become a core focus of decision making in the future and tech innovation will drive how this data is collected and utilized. Likewise, the tech takeover will drive the major trends of the near future in most, if not all industries; and having a visionary CTO/CIO is vital to understanding these trends and gaining a competitive advantage.
Tech and the Customer Experience
Now although it is easy to misinterpret this as a phenomenon brought about by the pandemic, a closer analysis reveals that it is simply an acceleration of a trend that we were already witnessing: the increased use of tech to meet customer needs.
In truth it isn't a question of tech vs. non-tech, but a question of how technology can empower a company to provide a superior customer experience. In truth, Uber didn't kill the taxi business through technical wizardry, it simply increased access to cabs, provided customers with greater transparency over their fares, and a more convenient way to make bookings. Likewise, Airbnb didn't disrupt the hospitality industry through rocket science, it simply used technology to increase the availability of accommodation and offer a greater array of pricing options.
Although we may perceive the trend as a 'tech-takeover', it is really a 'customer-experience' takeover driven by technology. The shifts in cash, and the changes in customer behavior caused by the COVID-19 crisis are simply accelerating this trend. At the end of the day, the customer is still key and as a business, being able to adapt to changing behavior patterns of the customer will define the success of the company.
""Software is Eating the World"" - Marc Andreessen
As the quote from one of the founding members of Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most renowned venture capital firms in the Silicon Valley suggests, business models are changing and being disrupted by tech companies. More and more, engineers are heading companies that become industry leaders, tech companies are growing exponentially, and traditional companies are deepening the use of technology in how they serve their customers.
As the table shows, the five largest companies in the world by market cap are all tech companies: Apple ($1.4 trillion), Microsoft ($1.39 trillion), Amazon ($1.2 trillion), Alphabet ($984 billion), and Facebook ($642 billion). These companies have continued to earn revenue during the pandemic while other companies have struggled to survive. Today, they have a combined cash reserve of $458 billion; so, a likely trend is the acquisition of struggling non-tech businesses by these tech companies who will then work on transforming them into businesses that harness tech to meet their customers' needs.

National insurance credit card payments set for May 20 were generally unchanged.
Corona grants
Self-employed individuals whose monthly sales revenues averaged NIS 1,500 – NIS 24,000 in 2019 but fell by 25% in January-February 2021 or March-April 2021 may claim still corona grants. Grant amounts for them range from NIS 3,000-6,000. Special rules apply when calculating the average in the case of maternity, reserve duty or businesses started in January-February 2020.
Other businesses and major company shareholders may receive larger grants according to different rules.

2021-05-20,"Emergency financial compensation for rockets, COVID-19 - opinion",,"In Nigeria, this has proven to be costly. The vacuum created by the government has been filled by merchants of faith, spell-binders and mercenaries engaged in a ""Plandemic war"" - a war of misinformation by anti-vaxxers. Their main arena is the social media and the pulpit where they spew conspiracy theories about how COVID-19 is an artificial creation by Big Pharma and a greedy, cross-border capitalist elite...
Nigerians are playing with COVID-19, and in so doing they are playing with fire and death. Why are we so blest and yet so suicidal? When the index case of the virus was announced on February 27, 2020, and the government proceeded to adopt lockdown measures at both national and sub-national levels, the people were gripped by fear and anxiety. COVID-19 was something strange that they could not deal with. The fact that it turned out to be a global pandemic, spreading like wildfire, burning down lives and hopes, made the situation more frightening. When government, following the pattern observed elsewhere, decided to ease the lockdown, and businesses were allowed to re-open in order to save the economy from total collapse, Nigerians heaved a sigh of relief and began to run their lives in spite of the virus. They respected the non-pharmaceutical interventions which government prescribed for a while, but in due course all the masks disappeared. Even the isolation centres that were set up in different parts of the country became inactive. Many of those isolation centres were shut down and the healthcare workers re-assigned.
We began to hear less and less of those phrases that defined the pandemic at its peak: Contact tracing, physical distancing, social distancing, use of sanitiser. When the lockdown was eased, the Presidential Task Force and the state governments rolled out a number of prescriptions. Religious bodies were required to reduce their gatherings to half the capacity of the halls in which their events took place. The registers of those who attended such gatherings were expected to be kept so that in the event of an outbreak of infections, it would be possible to trace contacts and contain any form of community spread. I love going to the market to buy vegetables, sea food and other items. Over the years, this has provided me the opportunity to mix and mingle with the real people of Nigeria. A typical Nigerian market has a life of its own.
As the pandemic raged, there were local government officials manning the entry points to the markets. I recall being sent back to the car more than twice, with a very polite reminder that without a mask, I could not be allowed entry. I dutifully obeyed with apologies, or I promptly fished out my mask and wore it, following which I would stretch out my hand for a shower of sanitiser. Supermarkets insisted on the same protocol, but that didn't impress me, because once you got into the store, you could see all manners of reckless persons yanking off their masks. Because there were no sanctions and Nigerian leaders who made the rules did not show the example, the people themselves gradually began to conclude that COVID-19 is a scam, some form of ""play-play"" (that is a Nigerian term) with which Nigerian politicians siphon money from the state treasury. They could see politicians organising rallies at which they disregarded COVID-19 protocols. They could see government officials walking about as if they had a form of divine immunity. The religious leaders did not help matters. Some of them pointedly told the people that there is nothing called coronavirus, and that a Christian is covered by the blood of Jesus. For some reason, the prevalence rates in Africa was quite low, except perhaps in the colder parts of the continent (the Cape Province and Gauteng in South Africa and in the countries of North Africa). Every one relaxed. Coronavirus became classified as a rich man's affliction, from which the poor were allegedly protected.
I recall attending a small family get-together at the time when everyone was almost forgetting about the virus. I arrived at the event wearing a mask. Really modest gathering, to honour a friend who had recorded yet another significant milestone in his life. The moment my friend welcomed me into his compound, he kept telling me to remove my mask. I refused. I wasn't prepared to take any risk. He then asked me to look around and see if anyone was wearing a mask. Indeed, nobody else wore a mask. The jollification was in full swing. I looked around. There was this woman gyrating like a cone on the dancing floor, thrusting her chest and derriere in a tantalising, mermaid-like, manner, enough to distract a man of gentlemanly manners. I got carried away for a moment as I fixed my gaze on her wondrous assets.
""Dr., I say remove this mask. You can't be the only one wearing a mask at this gathering. People will laugh at you.""
""No. I will keep it on. Coronavirus is real. It has not gone yet. Have you not been following what is going in the United States and Europe? We even hear that the situation could get worse before the end of the year.""
""That is in those places. They are the ones who know what sin they have committed that God is punishing them for. In this our own town, there is no corona here. Evil is not our portion in the name of Jesus!""
""There is Corona in this your town, my brother. Every day on Arise TV, we track the coronavirus trend, and offer analysis. I know what I am talking about.""
""That is television. You people must have something to say every morning. Even if nothing exists, you will create it and use sweet mouth to convince people. I beg, come and sit down and eat and drink. Let me see whether you will drink through the face mask. Mr. Co-ro-na!""
The people rang in the New Year on their own terms. They trooped to the beaches in large numbers. One video showed a sea of heads at a beach in Lagos! Entertainment spots were filled up. End of the year parties were held. On cross-over night, the churches welcomed end-of-year revelers who brazenly advertised their violation of the law. We stepped into the year 2021 against the background of fears that the numbers will rise and there may be chaos lurking around the corner.
When it was time to take pictures with my friend and his family, and I showed up in front of the camera, still with a face mask, he was the one who personally removed my mask with his hands. ""My friend, respect yourself, you want to take pictures with me, you are wearing a mask. How would I convince anybody that you travelled all the way from Lagos to honour me?"" It was the last community, family-oriented event that I attended in the year 2020. As if I knew..!
As the year drew to a close, we began to hear reports of a second variant of the virus that is deadlier, more dangerous and 70 per cent more transmissible than the original virus named COVID-19. The mutant variant was reportedly sighted in the United Kingdom, where a Third Wave had already forced the authorities to impose a tiered system of lockdown on the entire country. The same variant was also sighted in South Africa and in due course in other countries of the world: 33 as at the last count. Many countries began to shut their borders again as the virus remained capricious. Meanwhile, the emergence of a new variant of coronavirus abbreviated the joy that the world had experienced with the emergence of vaccine candidates with impressive safety, efficacy and immunogenicity profiles, which had already been granted emergency authorisation and deployed across the world. Pfizer-BioNTech, Moderna, Astra-Zeneca-Oxford and the vaccines they came up with raised hopes that humanity would at last beat the virus. In the U.S., U.K., Canada, UAE, Russia, China and across Europe, clinical trials and vaccinations were in progress. Scientists worked round the clock to reduce and checkmate the terror of the virus. There were hiccups and concerns, but it was instructive to see the amount of devotion that the war against coronavirus generated across boundaries.
Nigerian authorities would eventually wake up. They began to warn afresh about the need to #take-responsibility. The Presidential Task Force and the Nigeria Centre for Disease Control (NCDC) announced that the infection rate in Nigeria was going up. They further disclosed that the new variant that was reported in the U.K. in September had actually been identified at a Genomics Laboratory at Redeemer's University, Ede, Osun State, Nigeria, in a research led by Professor Christian Happi and his team. If the U.K. had probably not raised the alarm, Nigeria would not have drawn attention to this fact. By the last week of the year 2020, the country was already recording over 1,031 infections per day, and that grew steadily to 1,074 cases per day. Still, the people couldn't be bothered. They defied government counsel and continued to hold all kinds of parties: Weddings, funerals, house-warmings, naming ceremonies. The counsel that people should stay away from large gatherings during the Yuletide and New Year season was ignored. Lagos and other state governments re-imposed curfews and threatened that there would be sanctions. Lagos declared what it called ""Operation No Tolerance"". Government could well have been talking to the deaf.
The people rang in the New Year on their own terms. They trooped to the beaches in large numbers. One video showed a sea of heads at a beach in Lagos! Entertainment spots were filled up. End of the year parties were held. On cross-over night, the churches welcomed end-of-year revelers who brazenly advertised their violation of the law. We stepped into the year 2021 against the background of fears that the numbers will rise and there may be chaos lurking around the corner. When reminded of their own folly, the average Nigerian would tell you that COVID-19 had disappeared with the year 2020! When told that in one week alone, 20 doctors died and that more celebrity deaths were recorded, the people ignored the message. To have a community where the people do not care whether they die or not is a classic representation of Nigeria's descent into anomie.
It must be possible for the congregation to interrogate pastors and ask cogent questions. No pastor should be allowed the affectation of Solomonic imperialism that we now see in Nigerian churches. It is even more disturbing that some politicians have joined the trend. There is this other video showing Senator Dino Melaye speaking evangelically about COVID-19 and the vaccine.
In one word, Nigerians refused to take responsibility. The government failed to enforce its own rules. I used to urge the Nigerian government to pay more attention to public communication and adjust its strategies. At this point, I am beginning to doubt my own prescription. It may now be difficult to convince anyone that strategic communication is the problem. One year after the virus, I do not think that there is anyone in the world who has not heard of COVID-19. People in the rural areas have relatives and friends living in the cities. Both rural and urban residents know at least one person living in Europe or North America and Asia. The No. 1 topic in the media has remained the scourge of COVID-19. We are paying the price for the lack of trust between government and the people. Why should Nigerians trust the same political leaders who kept COVID-19 palliatives for themselves and used them as birthday gifts? Some of the most enduring images of 2020 was that of poor Nigerians forcing warehouses and the homes of politicians open to liberate COVID-19 palliative materials. Thus, when government officials talk about saving the people, nobody takes them seriously. The people would rather resort to self-help.
In Nigeria, this has proven to be costly. The vacuum created by the government has been filled by merchants of faith, spell-binders and mercenaries engaged in a ""Plandemic war"" - a war of misinformation by anti-vaxxers. Their main arena is the social media and the pulpit where they spew conspiracy theories about how COVID-19 is an artificial creation by Big Pharma and a greedy, cross-border capitalist elite, or as they argue, unconscionably, a ploy to create a World Government under the control of the Illuminati. There are now about 31 million people following anti-vaccine groups on Facebook and YouTube. The church is part of this anti-corona movement. Pentecostal pastors are particularly notorious. They hide under divine immunity to mislead their congregation and impose their own alternative facts. There is a video in circulation, for example, of Pastor Chris Oyakhilome where he tells his captive audience: ""Let me show you something. A calendar."" And then he goes on to indoctrinate the people relying on a calendar nobody else has seen.
It must be possible for the congregation to interrogate pastors and ask cogent questions. No pastor should be allowed the affectation of Solomonic imperialism that we now see in Nigerian churches. It is even more disturbing that some politicians have joined the trend. There is this other video showing Senator Dino Melaye speaking evangelically about COVID-19 and the vaccine. He asked people pointedly not to take any vaccine. I thought the man in the video was a body double. But he looked like Melaye quite alright. I was alarmed. Melaye was not dancing, singing, or making comedy, for which he is well known. He was dead serious. That is the reality of our situation. I won't be shocked if my carpenter suddenly shows up tomorrow as the Anthony Fauci of Nigeria and he gets a sizeable following!
It is the failure of government and the crisis of leadership that is at play. Towards the end of 2020, we had the untidy situation whereby the Presidential Task Force openly blamed state governments for failing to sustain the interventionist pathways funded by the Federal Government and the Organised Private Sector under the auspices of CA-COVID and the Central Bank of Nigeria. The states were asked to reopen the isolation centres. But how many of those isolation centres and laboratories are still functioning or in good shape? They have probably been looted. The Federal Government also asked the states to suspend the re-opening of schools till January 18, 2021. Some of the states are insisting they would re-open schools anyway. One state government's spokesperson reportedly said they would listen only to the governor of their State. So is this about ego then? What does this tell us? Lack of synergy. The Federal Government says we should expect vaccines by the end of January. How? Which vaccines? Are we on any waiting list? Have we made orders? Is there an operational plan in place? We are in January already. Nigeria needs to learn how other countries, like Greece for example, manage these things. And then the other day, the Federal Government published a list of 100 passport numbers, travellers who failed to observe the seven-day post arrival, mandatory PCR test. Of what use are those passport numbers? Is it not better to name the owners of the passports? Nigeria needs to get its acts together. We are far behind. We need new thinking.

2021-01-06,Nigeria - Playing With Covid-19 [opinion],,"Apr 30, 2020( Ventureburn: http://ventureburn.com Delivered by Newstex)  One of the positive impacts of Covid-19 on the global economy, is that it is accelerating the pace of digital transformation within public and private organisations. Health authorities, like the Health Professions Council of South Africa (HPCSA), that have otherwise been slow to adopt telehealth or virtual care have now approved digital platforms for patient care; government too has released the long-awaited additional spectrum to support data requirements and telecommunication companies. What's interesting to me is how this global pandemic is catalysing digital transformation across industries. 
As the New York Times noted recently on the progress of telemedicine, '10 Years of Change in One Week'. The effects of the Covid-19 lockdown, or part thereof, will likely persist for the foreseeable future and unfortunately for a lot longer than we all previously envisaged. Covid-19 is catalysing digital transformation across industries in a number of areas, venture capitalists should be prepared What it means to us as people is that we will become accustomed to a new way of living. The measures we put in place to tackle the coronavirus will usher in the new normal, in a post-Covid-19 world. As tech investors it's our role to look at the ever-changing landscape and identify solutions that will shape the future. As famously said by Winston Churchill, 'never waste a good crisis'. So, here are my top 10 temporary relief measures that I believe will likely leave a permanent mark on the way we live and do business: Last mile distribution and e-commerce solutions: Last mile delivery services and online shopping has become top priority for retail stores. As a retailer, if you don't have it — you'll not only lose the sale, you'll also lose the customer. Physical in-store presence won't be as important for future consumers. Future of work: Virtual work from home, digital work boards, digital productivity tools and task managers will become critical for the future of work. Remote working environments won't just be reserved for millennial business owners or senior management anymore; we expect to see this become more mainstream as staff increasingly desire flexibility to work from home and businesses look to reduce operational expenses by reducing the size of office spaces. The acceleration of telemedicine or virtual healthcare: The coronavirus pandemic has seen a reduction of face-to-face doctors' consultations. Hospitals have had to halt the intake of patients due to staff being infected and adjust to remote testing and virtual care. This will become more prevalent and widely accepted. Plus, wellness and personal hygiene will matter a whole lot more. People that spend this much time at home are becoming more self-aware. Digital payment platforms: No one wants to hold physical cash, a debit or credit card, a POS device that requires entering a pin, or hold anybody else's pen to sign for a payment. All means of payment will move to no/low-touch and eventually migrate to fully digital. The use of facial recognition and mobile phones as means of payment will become more widely used. Online learning tools: What none of us signed up for was home-schooling our children during this crisis. Parents will see the benefit of online learning. Once over the adoption hurdle (which is forced on all of us) it will become a tool we cannot live without. When kids go back to school, expect to see more online classroom tools making their way back home. Manufacturing tech: Localising global supply chains will become important to reduce dependencies on a single market. Manufacturing technology (using Fourth Industrial Revolution technologies) will become important to enable local manufacturers to complete globally. Human-less manufacturing pioneered by companies like Tesla will become more necessary for business continuity planning in the face of reduced production. Financial Inclusion: Once we are over the crisis, financial inclusion will become front and centre at a whole new level. Especially, useful and affordable financial products and services that individuals and businesses can access to reduce deficits or bridge the gap between the formal and informal economy. SME's are not being properly serviced in the traditional lending sector due to perceived credit risk resulting in a large funding gap. There isn't yet a properly formulated credit scoring model for SME's in a digital economy. Everyone will realise that traditional financiers credit scoring mechanisms are so out of touch with SME's in a digital world. Data analytics: with more and more people online, data tools, data analytics and AI will become instrumental to improve decision making. Increased data can enable business to tailor solutions to specific customers. Govtech and e-services: Government's adoption of technology will continue to rise to better serve citizens. The adoption of e-services can increase efficiency and decrease timelines for basic services for bureaucratic government departments. Innovative tech collaborations: Large corporates like Vodacom and Discovery have partnered to deliver an online healthcare platform for the benefit of all South Africans during the Covid-19 pandemic. These type of partnerships as well as partnerships with the public sector can be used to develop tech solutions for socio-economic issues that have been exacerbated by Covid-19 such as inequality and unemployment.

2020-04-30,10 things venture capitalists should invest in during Covid-19 [Opinion],,"Oct 25, 2020( Deutsche Welle Germany: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/germany/s-1432 Delivered by Newstex)  The health minister tested positive for COVID-19 after meeting with colleagues. Officials implore Germans to stay home for their communities — but often fail to practice what they preach, writes DW's Rosalia Romaniec.When the news that Health Minister Jens Spahn had tested positive for the coronavirus was made public last week, many in Germany expected that half of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Cabinet would have to isolate as well. In the morning on the day he tested positive, Spahn participated in a meeting of government ministers. 
There was certainly a vocal exchange — possibly loud at times — and maybe even some laughter. Not everyone present would have worn masks the entire time. And is a meeting like that even safe? It's the federal government, after all.There is a risk wherever people meet. And these are German leaders who are accompanied by security personnel and government staff to several meetings a day as part of their job governing a country of 83 million people. Even more concerning is that nobody decided to isolate after hearing of Spahn's positive test — not even as a precautionary measure. In the end, a single minister decided to have herself tested.Read more: Coronavirus deaths in Germany pass 10,000On the day Spahn's infection was confirmed, his spokesperson said the health minister had had ""no fever,"" but that ""cold symptoms"" were present. Excuse me? Did Spahn go into the Cabinet meeting with cold symptoms? The reassuring answer came two days later: no — in the meeting, Spahn had just noticed a hoarse throat, but the cold symptoms didn't come until later, which is why he decided to test that very day.Read more: German lawmakers urge shorter coronavirus quarantinePrecaution 'whenever possible'Merkel did not recommend that all who were present at the meeting be tested — but her spokesperson did clarify the hygiene policies of the chancellery and noted that the meeting had been held in a large open room with modern ventilation. That which is not wrong, is not automatically right, of course. Possible doubts could quickly have been clarified. A government that is urging Germans to follow strict measures could have offered a helpful display of caution.Perhaps Merkel is tired of the pandemic. The otherwise-disciplined chancellor even allowed herself a small slipup last week. ""Whenever possible,"" Merkel said on her weekly podcast, ""please stay home."" Shortly after, she was spotted shopping in Berlin — though with a mask.Read more: Should Germans should panic-buy during the pandemic?Some people who see the otherwise-admonitory Merkel in line for the register might simply think it's nifty to have caught the chancellor out shopping. Others might decide that the pandemic is not so dangerous, after all, if Merkel thinks shopping is still safe. It's not an easy time for politicians, but they may be underestimating the value of setting an example.Read more: Journalists document German officials' wasted weeks early in the pandemicWho's the spreader?Up until the beginning of summer, the only people wearing masks at the Reichstag, the seat of the German parliament, were the facility's staff and journalists. Politicians walked the halls as if they were immune. For the first months of the pandemic, the Bundestag was its own universe. Masks have only been required in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, since October 6.Which brings us back to Spahn. Last week, he met with several people. From whom he caught the coronavirus could not be traced. It seems odd that Berlin's city-state health officials would say the matter is back under control. For a while, they have not been able to promptly inform people who need to isolate. In fairness, several leading German politicians have self-isolated out of concern for the people around them, including Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.On Twitter, Spahn told the people whom he had encountered during the period that he hopes they ""stay healthy."" In April, he had offered a bit of foreshadowing when he said: ""We are likely going to have to forgive each other for a lot."" He was so right.","EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (99%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (91%); CABINET OFFICES (90%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); TALKS & MEETINGS (90%); CORONAVIRUSES (89%); EPIDEMICS (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (89%); COMMON COLD (88%); GERMAN CHANCELLORS (78%); ISOLATION & QUARANTINE (78%); VIRUSES (76%); PANIC BUYING (73%); Opinion (%)

2020-10-25,Opinion: COVID-19 hits the Cabinet and German leaders shrug,,"Sydney: University of New South Wales has issued the following news release:
In Australia and internationally, older people are more likely than younger people to die of COVID-19. Some of the most worrying clusters of cases are in residential aged care facilities, including so-called hotspots Newmarch House and Dorothy Henderson Lodge in Sydney.
In response, many aged care facilities have taken steps to restrict contact between residents and visitors. Some have imposed voluntary lockdown. Yet some family members of residents say the restrictions have gone too far because their loved ones are facing the end of life alone.
There have been countless reports during the coronavirus emergency of people dying alone, both because older people are separated from their families, and because resource-constrained healthcare systems struggle to maintain presence at the bedside of a person approaching the end of life.
These reports have touched a nerve across our communities. Dying alone has come to signify not only a harrowing aspect of the pandemic, but also the strained capacity of our health and care systems to cope with the new circumstances.
Dying alone – although it may be a preference for some – challenges our cultural norms and ideals about the end of life, namely being surrounded by loved ones.
Being denied access to a dying loved one – a husband of decades or a mother – also has profound psychological and practical consequences for families. And distancing measures during the pandemic have unsettled our cultural practices after death, as family members have been unable to physically congregate to grieve.
Concern about the separation of older people with the virus and their families has prompted some health workers to go to great lengths to keep people connected, such as setting up regular phone calls and video links.
Some hospitals have appointed specialist staff to keep families in contact and uphold cultural and spiritual rituals and practices. According to the Daily Mail one family was with their ageing father on video stream as he died in a Melbourne hospital.
According to a report in the Sydney Morning Herald, Intensive Care Unit director at the Austin hospital in Melbourne, Dr Stephen Warrillow, said: “If somebody is dying we would always try and find a way so there is human connection. No one ever dies alone in ICU. Ever.”
While for most Australians, social distancing has been a challenging disruption from normal work and family life, many residents in aged care facilities are all too familiar with the suffering imposed by isolation.
Previous estimates have suggested that up to 40 per cent of aged care residents have no visitors, even in normal circumstances. So even outside of the current pandemic, many older people face the end of life without the sense of social, relational and cultural connectedness that most of us would hope for and expect.
Why doesn't this generate the same horror in the community?
Social isolation at the end of life in residential aged care has complex causes, and devastating effects. Many contemporary families are widely dispersed and geographical separation makes visiting more difficult. As older residents' bodies and minds deteriorate, fear, shame or lack of understanding can lead to less interaction between residents and their loved ones.
An absence of social connection can lead to feelings of worthlessness, hopelessness and depression for those approaching the end of life. As residents are exposed to the deaths of peers or co-residents, this also severs social ties, affecting their sense of belonging and community.
As the bodies and minds of older people change, they need more support to maintain social and relational connection and cultural and spiritual identity. So too, families need more support to remain connected to their older members through these changes, and through the geographical separation now common in contemporary families. This will provide older people with wellbeing, identity and dignity in death, as well as in life.
Over the last decade, Australia's frameworks and guidelines for palliative and end-of-life care for older people have more adequately recognised the importance of social relationships. Yet the relational, spiritual, cultural and social needs at the end of life among people in residential aged care and their loved ones are in need of much greater attention and resourcing in policy and practice.
While hospital and residential aged care staff find new and creative ways to help their residents connect with others, perhaps the pandemic can serve as a timely reminder of the need to support all efforts to improve social and cultural connection for our older residents as they approach the end of life. After all, one day that might be us.","DEATH & DYING (93%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); EPIDEMICS (90%); FAMILY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); SENIOR CITIZENS (89%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (89%); AGING (78%); GRIEF (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (77%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (77%); INTENSIVE CARE UNITS (77%); SOCIAL ISOLATION (77%); LEVELS OF CARE (75%); VIRUSES (74%); CUSTOMS & CULTURAL HERITAGE (66%)

2020-06-02,Opinion COVID-19 places spotlight on dying alone,,"Corby: The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport has issued the following press release:
The latest Government Business Insights report reveals that the transportation and storage sector has been hit hardest by Covid and Brexit.
ParcelHero says the shock result shows that more supply chain companies have closed and fewer surviving firms are currently trading than in any other sector.
The latest Office for National Statistics (ONS) Business Insights report reveals the shock news that the transportation and storage industry has been hardest hit of all sectors by Covid and Brexit. The home delivery expert ParcelHero says that even hotels, food services, arts and entertainment have fared better.
The logistics and supply chain sector is a trusted barometer of the economy and that these results come as a shock. The report – “Business insights and impact on the UK economy” – reveals that, between 17-30 May, 9.6% of “Transportation and storage” category companies reported they had now closed permanently; 15% were still temporarily shuttered and just 75.4% had resumed trading. These trading status figures are grim reading and highlight the double whammy of the pandemic and Brexit on the transport and supply chain sector.
To put the results into context, we might have expected the “Accommodation and food service activities” sector to have been significantly more damaged by lockdowns than transportation and storage. After all, no one was able to go on holiday or eat out for months. That proved not to be the case, however. During the latter half of May, only 1.6% of eateries and hotels reported they had closed their doors permanently; 15.1% remained closed temporarily and 83.3% had resumed trading.
Likewise, even the “Arts, entertainment and recreation” sector fared better, despite long periods of lockdown. No entertainment companies contributing to the report said they had closed permanently, although 14.3% were still temporarily shut. An impressive 85.4% of arts and entertainment organisations are now open again.
Both the arts and the accommodation and food sectors actually reported worse financial performances than transport and storage firms, but significantly fewer organisations actually failed.
The report is obviously grim news for transport and storage companies. It also strikes a warning note for anyone hoping to see evidence of an economic recovery. The logistics sector is an indicator of the economy. When manufacturers and retailers are doing well, their transport providers are busy; similarly, when UK companies begin to struggle, transport and warehousing is the first sector to show an immediate decline.
The root of the problem is that freight transport companies are particularly exposed to the impact of Brexit. This is on top of issues caused by the pandemic. It's extremely concerning that Customs problems have not got any better since Brexit regulations first hit in January. Says the report: “The proportions of businesses experiencing challenges in importing and exporting are broadly unchanged since January 2021. ” That is a damning indictment of current Government policy.
During the period 3-16 May, 38.2% of exporters reported increased challenges around additional paperwork; 26.8% reported challenges with new Customs duties; 15.2% indicated reduced demand for products and 8.6% complained of disruption at UK borders. Brexit issues remain a hurdle for exporters and their transport providers.","EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (99%); BREXIT (91%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT (90%); TRANSPORTATION SECTOR PERFORMANCE (90%); BUSINESS CLOSINGS (89%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (88%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (78%); GOVERNMENT STATISTICS AGENCIES (78%); CLOSINGS (77%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (77%); IMPORT TRADE (76%); STATISTICS (76%); FOOD SECTOR PERFORMANCE (75%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (74%); PRESS RELEASES (73%); ECONOMIC RECOVERY (69%)

2021-06-11,THE OPINION: Covid-19 and Brexit have hit transportation and storage harder than any other sector,,"Iran's Cyber Police has arrested thousands of Iranians during the coronavirus epidemic for exposing the regime's mismanagement of the COVID-19 crisis.
Two senior officials told state-run TV that criminal charges had been filed against the detainees who had ""spread rumors"" about the coronavirus epidemic.
Yesterday, the head of the Cyber Police Diagnosis and Prevention Center told state-run TV that the detainees had said the regime was covering up the number of deaths from the virus.
""Before COVID-19 even entered the country and before it was officially announced, we had numerous reports and rumors from videos that showed coronavirus patients hospitalized or patients that had collapsed on the street,"" Colonel Mohammad Ali Rajabi said.
The Cyber police official said that people had started criticizing the regime for not closing its borders with other countries and not implementing quarantine, adding that there were efforts to ""cause despair among the people"".
""For example, they wanted to make it seem as though the (state) was not transparent in this regard and that the people were not given the truth,"" he told state-run TV.
""At the same time, they tried to imply that the government was inefficient and that the country's health and the administrative system could not manage the COVID-19 epidemic,"" the Cyber Police official added.
Colonel Mohammad Ali Rajab said that the Cyber Police had identified more than 2,000 websites and social media channels that had shed light on the regime's shortcomings.
""We have introduced 370 cases to the judiciary, and these include arrests, summonses, and pledges,"" he added.
An IRGC commander also told state-run TV that 3,600 citizens were arrested for ""spreading rumors"" about the COVID-19 crisis.
General Abolfazl Shekarchi, the spokesperson for the General Staff of the Armed Forces of the Islamic Republic of Iran thanked the Cyber Police for countering ""rumors"".
""As for the actions taken to confront those who spread rumors, the Cyber Police have done a great job,"" he told state-run TV on April 28.
""3,600 people who spread rumors on social media were arrested by the police and the (Paramilitary) Basij forces, and 1,136 lawsuits have been filed against them,"" he added.
Today, Iran's Ministry of Health announced the death toll from COVID-19 as 6,028.
But an opposition group that accuses the regime of covering up death toll figures said that 37,600 people had died in 308 cities across Iran.
The National Council of Resistance says its death toll figures have been gathered by reliable sources inside the country.

COVID-19 pandemic has forced more than 1.5 billion students in 165 countries out of school, enforcing the global academic community to explore new ways of teaching and learning, including distance and online education, according to UNESCO estimates.
This has proven challenging for both students and educators, who have to deal with the emotional, physical and economic difficulties posed by the illness while doing their part to help curb the spread of the virus, notes United Nations Academic Impact (UNAI).
UNAI is an initiative that aligns institutions of higher education with the United Nations in supporting and contributing to the realization of United Nations goals and mandates, including the promotion and protection of human rights, access to education, sustainability and conflict resolution.
""The future is uncertain for everyone, particularly for millions of students scheduled to graduate this year who will face a world crippled economically by the pandemic,"" UNAI alerts.
In the COVID-19 and higher education series, United Nations Academic Impact talked to students, educators and researchers in different parts of the world to find out how the pandemic has affected them and how they are coping with the changes.
Bowen Xu, a student of Chinese-English Language Translation at the Graduate Institute of Interpretation and Translation, Shanghai International Studies University, is in his final year of graduate school, scheduled to graduate in summer 2020.
He moved from China to New York for at internship at United Nations Headquarters in January; weeks after that, the COVID-19 outbreak disrupted the celebration of the 2020 Spring Festival in all parts of China.
As Bowen approached the end of his internship, the situation in China had improved, but his return flight was cancelled and it became extremely difficult to book a flight, as New York rapidly became the epicenter of the pandemic.
Listen to the interview with Bowen, in which he shares his story of not being able return home, and the different ways in which COVID-19 has impacted his life. He also talks about the overwhelming sense of loss that all graduates are experiencing, unable to have a traditional celebration for their graduation or say goodbye to their friends and professors, and the feeling of uncertainty about their professional aspirations as they graduate into an economic recession.
Despite all the difficulties, Bowen remains positive and has used the time to develop new skills and do things he normally didn't have enough time to do. 
Another person UNAI talked to is Talitha Dias, a Brazilian lawyer currently pursuing a master's degree in International Contractual Relations at the Federal University of Pernambuco in the Northeast of Brazil.
Talitha's master's program was scheduled to begin in March, but classes have been postponed due to COVID-19. With the unexpected changes in her 2020 calendar, Talitha had to quickly devise a plan B: she started teaching English online, began taking online courses for her professional development, and explored new skills such as cooking. This new routine has helped Talitha remain patient and positive despite all the uncertainties about her future.
Like many countries, the pandemic has had a devastating impact on Brazil and Talitha shared her concerns about the capacity of the country's public health system to handle the number of coronavirus cases. It has also been difficult for many Brazilian schools and universities to pivot to distance learning and it is taking time for them to adapt to the new virtual learning landscape, while some Brazilian students have misgivings about the quality of online education.
Despite the challenges, Talitha believes this difficult time will pass and it will teach us some important lessons such as the value of time spent with loved ones and empathy for and solidarity with others. Listen to the full interview with Talitha here.
UNAI also talked to Hana Ibrahim, a medical student at the University of Paris, who has been volunteering at the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) of the Lariboisière Hospital in Paris during the COVID-19 outbreak.
Hana is 21 years old and is in the middle of her practical training, but when the pandemic started many departments of the hospital, including the Department of Endocrinology and Diabetology where she works, were closed and those resources diverted to treating patients with COVID-19.
Seeing the struggle that the Intensive Care and Infectious Disease departments were going through with the overwhelming number of patients pouring in, Hana decided to volunteer for the ICU, despite her heavy academic commitments.
Hana shared with UNAI her story of being a medical student and a volunteer during a global health emergency, including the extraordinary levels of mental and physical pressure and concerns that many members of the public don't realize the gravity of the situation. Hana has also thought about changing her medical specialty as a result of this experience.
In an interview, Madalitso Kamenya, a student pursuing his master's degree in Agricultural Economics at the University of Pretoria, South Africa, said the e lockdown caused by COVID-19 has created great challenges.
Trapped in a student bedroom at his university, he has been trying to keep a daily routine that includes physical exercise, conversations with family and friends in his home country of Malawi, and academic assignments. For him, being alone and isolated is one of the most difficult parts of this pandemic, but technology has played an important role in helping him stay connected with people.
Madalitso remains optimistic and believes the world will be a better place after COVID-19, but he also doesn't believe this is the last pandemic we will face. He believes this situation presents opportunities for us to change the way we do things and universities should continue exploring new ways of teaching so we will have systems in place if there is another pandemic.Listen to the full interview with Madalitso Kamenyahere.
Listen to the full interview with Marina Romanova.She is an undergraduate student of International Relations at the Lomonosov Moscow State University in Russia. The COVID-19 outbreak began in the middle of her exchange program in Switzerland and she was forced to leave the country and return to Russia due to the uncertainty of the situation.
Despite the stress created by the pandemic, Marina is grateful that she and her parents are healthy, and she has the tools necessary to continue her studies remotely. Her classmates in Russia had to go through a much more challenging time, as Moscow State University did not have online learning platforms prior to the lockdown. However, the situation is improving, and new platforms are being developed for the students.
Read and listen further UNAI interviews:
Interview with Heba Hany, Helwan University (Egypt)Interview with Pablo de Castro,University of Chile (Chile)Interview with Dr.Michael Krüger,Ludwigsburg University of Education (Germany)Interview with Dr. Michael Moore, Adelphi University (United States)Interview with Dr. Bushra Naeem,Balochistan University of Information Technology, Engineering, and Management Sciences (Pakistan)
Marina is scheduled to graduate next year, but the pandemic has made her future uncertain as it is now more difficult to travel overseas and to do an internship or pursue a master's degree. Marina has been able to find the positive aspects of the pandemic, saying the quarantine has helped her study habits and she has developed a deeper understanding of the interconnectedness of the world and the importance of good healthcare systems for citizens.

2020-07-11,The Path Forward For Higher Education After COVID-19 – OpEd,,"For most of the world, the anniversary of the Tiananmen Square massacre recalls familiar yet macabre vignettes of hopeful students and the iron tanks that crushed them, along with their cries for freedom. In China, however, there is nothing to recall on June 4th because, as far as the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) is concerned, nothing happened. In his chilling book We Have Been Harmonized: Life in China's Surveillance State, Kai Strittmatter details the pains the CCP has taken to whitewash this day—not just from the history books, but from the minds of the Chinese people: ""You will find entries on Baidu Baike [China's Wikipedia] for the years 1988 and 1990—but 1989 doesn't exist. An entire year has been erased from history.""
The party's crusade to rewire the memories of 1.4 billion people has been largely successful. In exchange for thinking the right thoughts and living pacified lives, the CCP has delivered the economic goods. But General Secretary Xi Jinping and his comrades aren't taking any chances, particularly as economic growth slows and the nation's demographic outlook dims. Through incentivized self-censorship and conformity with the help of its social credit system, the party believes it can forestall more ""incidents"" like Tiananmen Square.
Every so often, though, the facade breaks, and the regime's brutality is exposed. Tiananmen Square was one such event, but the United States misread the moment. As former National Security Council official Michael Green put it, President George H.W. Bush sought ""to show the Chinese leaders and the U.S. Congress that the United States could not continue with business as usual, but in a way intended not to obstruct the core of U.S.-China relations."" Under President Bill Clinton, the bilateral relationship quickly got back on track, propelled by a pollyannish hope that increasing wealth would change the Communist Party's soul.
The Trump administration was right to jettison this assumption, and it appears that President Biden agrees. Even so, with notable exceptions, neither Democrats nor Republicans have seemed interested in holding China accountable for its modern-day Tiananmen moment: the COVID-19 pandemic.
In the wake of the viral outbreak, the party's veneer cracked again, and Chinese citizens saw that the CCP was more concerned with political survival than public health. This agenda led Xi and his comrades to initially focus on containing information instead of the virus. Had it acted expeditiously, China could have reduced its number of early 2020 cases by 95 percent, by some estimates. Instead, officials censored medical professionals and prohibited researchers from publishing anything about COVID-19. The results were disastrous, and an epidemic morphed into a pandemic.
Initially, the Trump administration appeared poised to punish the CCP. In July 2020, then-secretary of state Mike Pompeo warned that ""the world will absolutely make [China] pay a price"" for the coronavirus. President Donald Trump mused publicly about slapping Beijing with tariffs amounting to a trillion dollars. Meanwhile, senators and representatives drafted legislation that would expose China to U.S. litigation over pandemic damages. Other members suggested waiving interest payments on U.S. debt to Beijing. All told, more than 350 China-specific bills were filed between January and June 2020.
Even so, Washington refrained from taking direct steps to punish Beijing—a hesitancy that has persisted into the Biden administration. In an interview on March 28, Secretary of State Antony Blinken punted when asked whether China should face repercussions: ""I think the issue for us is to make sure that we do everything possible to prevent another pandemic."" The following week, President Biden brushed off similar inquiries, indicating that he had not spoken with Xi about China's pandemic responsibility.
If, as Blinken says, preventing the next pandemic is a top priority, then America has already failed. The 2002-2004 SARS outbreak, in many ways, foreshadowed COVID-19, especially in the pains the CCP took to conceal the disease, silence medical professionals and punish those who raised concerns. The CCP is hardly a first-time offender.
That's why the president's apparent refusal to even discuss the issue with Xi is so concerning. Biden will presumably have no excuse to avoid the conversation once he receives the intelligence community's report on the origins of COVID-19, slated to be completed by August. China's leaders have taken great pains to ensure that their own people receive a sanitized version of history in which the CCP emerges heroic and blameless—first on Tiananmen and now on COVID-19. There's no reason the rest of the world should accept their version of the story.

2021-06-02,What Tiananmen Square Can Teach Us About COVID-19 | Opinion,,"By Klaus Kotzé
After years of decay and deficiency, South Africa's executive has stood up to the COVID-19 pandemic. Its reflexive information campaign has dominated national news cycles; its narrative has sought command over the crisis. The executive's approach appears to have calmed the national mood. And though it has been active and determined, there remains an unclear picture of where exactly the nation will emerge once the pandemic has subsided.
The declaration of a state of disaster on March 15th has placed democratic South Africa in unchartered territory. In terms of its Disaster Management Act, the executive is afforded sweeping powers. The first regulations issued in terms of the Act on March 18th indicated a bellicose response. Though it included no mention thereof, the regulations paved the way to the national 'lockdown' that was declared on March 23rd. South Africa's would be a securitized path of command and constraint. The Department of Defense was instructed to ""release and mobilize any available resources."" The closure of schools, the limitation of gatherings and visits to correctional and other facilities, as well as a ban on the sale of alcohol all contributed to a framework of control. Additional directives are increasingly justified by the narrative of waging ""war"" on the virus.
Given the country's turbulent past, war-like analogies and approaches are dangerous. The evasion of war has been central to the democratic state; the national ethic is one of peace and reconciliation. South Africa's brutalized long-term and corrupted short-term history have resulted in a traumatic and broken present. Today the state, the institutional capacity, the nation is vulnerable. Cyril Ramaphosa has made this a central goal of his presidency: building a capable state. A frail state cannot easily handle the rhetoric and implications of war, whose effects are unpredictable and often uncontrollable.
Owing to the pandemic's global and exceptional nature, the executive has looked abroad to find ways to deal with it. As many others have, South Africa has followed the Chinese path of restriction. But South Africa is not China and while this avenue appears effective epidemiologically, the broader consequences of a strategy based on forced restrictions has implications that beg existential questions. What will lockdown do to the country's fragile socio-economic situation? The economy has been brought to a stand-still. The resulting broad-based downturn, job losses, and bankruptcies will have a dastardly effect on all – and the poor will be hardest hit.
On Thursday April 9th, President Ramaphosa declared that the initial 21-day lockdown will be extended by 14 days. Lockdown, especially applied to over-crowded informal areas, cannot be a lasting strategy. However, a simple return to normality will negate all the costly efforts made by South Africans. When it eventually emerges from the lockdown, the battle will not be over. While it helps to curb the spread of the virus, a lockdown can only really buy time for more extensive plans to be put into place. Without these efforts the benefits of lockdown will be short-lived. Extended securitization presents serious questions to the functioning of social order. The lasting effects on law and order, presently unknown, could be devastating.
While the executive has decisively led the campaign, critical questions have emerged regarding the role of the judiciary and the legislature. In true Ramaphosa style, the president has corralled opposition parties to support the efforts of the government. While the State of Disaster is no time for antagonism, opposition parties do hold important roles in asking tough questions of the government's approach and actions. As for Parliament, its check on the executive has virtually ground to a halt. The Disaster Management Act meanwhile does not impose requirements on the executive to report its actions to Parliament. The lockdown has come at a time when parliamentarians are required to work with communities around the country under the scheduled Parliamentarian Constituency Programme. Lockdown must not be used as an excuse not to execute their mandated oversight of the government's actions. Direct engagement with the people in a safe or even digital realm will afford members of Parliament critical insight into the realities on the ground.
By intervening in the functioning of the courts, declaring their partial closure, the Justice Minister arguably encroached upon the powers of the judiciary. In doing so he underscored the need for concordance between the executive and the judiciary during the ongoing crisis. In a reported letter from Justice Mogoeng, the Constitutional Court Chief Justice rebuked the minister. He reportedly asked whether the executive's interpretation of the Disaster Management Act does not afford it ""more extensive and restrictive powers"" than those provided under the more severe State of Emergency. ""Even in the case of the state of emergency"", said Mogoeng in an earlier letter to colleagues, ""the constitution empowers the courts to pronounce on the validity of the declaration… courts therefore have to stay open."" Herein, the chief justice reminds the executive that all exercise of power remains subject to the law and the review of the courts. The speaker of parliament will do well to follow this example. In executing her constitutional duties, she must ensure that Parliament continues to function not through the haphazard interpretation of its members, but as an institution. For one, as has been widely suggested, Parliament could establish a committed ad hoc committee that oversees the execution of Disaster Management Act regulations.
In his April 9th speech, President Ramaphosa laid out a three-part strategy to deal with ongoing effects of the pandemic. These include an ""intensified public health response"" ""a comprehensive package of economic support measures"" and ""a program of increased social support."" The measures are certainly welcome. Their introduction, however, does not present a new vision but a response to ongoing problems.
While data crunching and statistical modelling are useful tools through which to understand the problem, these remain inside a worldview of control, suggesting what should be avoided. The executive has not come up with a strategic vision that extends bureaucratic management to chart a path forward. This orientation does not address the transition from containment to liberation. Government's focus on lockdown as opposed to opening up threatens the South African economy and democracy. At present the state is simply copying from others who often have different ethical foundations and geopolitical interests. A successful strategy would reside in an honest and thorough comprehension of the national realities; South Africa continues to struggle to define its national interest and character post-Apartheid. Thus far, South Africa's tactics in addressing the pandemic have contributed to a tilt towards authoritarianism. This approach is in direct contradiction to the democratic ethos of its widely praised constitution.

2020-05-13,Assessing South Africa 's Response To COVID-19 – OpEd,,"There is a real risk that women will not be able to take advantage of new green jobs as countries overlook gender in pandemic stimulus
COVID-19 recovery plans present a historic opportunity for a green transition. But as of July, few countries seem to have seized upon it.
Only the EU, France, Germany and the UK - of 17 countries analysed in a new CARE Report, Building Forward - had included funding to enhance nature or tackle climate change in their pandemic recovery plans.
Even worse: plans in five countries - China, India, Indonesia, Russia and the United States - lacked a clear green response to the crisis and could even have negative implications for climate change.
Annual fossil fuel subsidies continue at a scale equivalent to 20 to 30 times the estimated cost of climate change adaptation in developing countries for 2030. So clearly, while the evidence is there, real commitment is missing.
In each of the last five years, more people have been internally displaced due to extreme weather events than as a result of armed conflicts and war, says a recent report by Oxfam. And if we don't put a quick brake on emissions, and especially stop burning fossil fuels and other natural resources, these extreme weather events will not only increase but also become even more severe.
Climate injustice is the reality we live in, especially for low-resource and income countries, which cause just a small fragment of rising emissions, but are the ones suffering the most. The average U.S. citizen, for example, produces as many emissions as 35 people in Bangladesh.
Now COVID-19 is putting even more pressure on people in poorer nations, forcing them to hide in crowded cyclone shelters, unable to socially distance and limiting their ability to access aid.
LEFT OUT
Ensuring women's and girls' rights, leadership and participation is critical for an effective, just and accountable response to COVID-19 - and for building a more resilient and inclusive post-pandemic world.
Unfortunately, gender and economic empowerment for women and girls seem to have been omitted in most climate-relevant COVID-19 recovery measures. For its new report, CARE reviewed nearly 350 measures and policies from the G20 countries identified as climate-relevant in the Energy Policy Tracker database. None was found to have an explicitly gender-differentiated approach or would specifically support women in the workforce.
Most of the climate solutions needed exist today and are ready to be implemented at a larger scale. Many of them can provide joint benefits to both the COVID-19 response and climate action in terms of mitigation and adaptation. Shifting to a low-carbon economy could create a $26 trillion economic opportunity and 65 million new jobs by 2030, according to a New Climate Economy report.
However, there is a real risk that women will not be able to take advantage of these opportunities. Much of the jobs growth is predicted in sectors that are traditionally male dominated, such as construction, energy, infrastructure and mining.
Without proactive investment in women's skills and girls' education, development and training, not much will change. This is especially so if systemic issues - such as hiring discrimination, gender-based job segmentation, lack of representation in decision-making bodies and persistent gender pay gaps - are not addressed.
The pandemic, with its serious economic repercussions, also poses a grave risk to maintaining the quantity and quality of climate, development and humanitarian financing, which are essential to confronting the crises.
Using COVID-19 as an excuse to reduce funding levels will exacerbate the effects of the pandemic and eradicate global progress. To turn the tide, we must act now. Recovery strategies must focus on ecosystem protection, climate-resilient agriculture and climate adaptation in a gender-transformative way and align with the Paris Agreement 1.5°C global warming goal.
Donor governments also need to deliver on official development assistance and climate finance commitments, while redirecting harmful fossil fuel subsidies towards a greener economy. At the same time, they should ensure that public money does not fund gender-ignorant policies or programmes but is used rather to make COVID-19 recovery plans work for both women and the climate.

2020-10-07,Opinion - Covid-19 Recovery - a Missed Opportunity to Fight Climate Change and Gender Inequality? [opinion],,"Sri Lanka, July 27 -- by Shanil Fernando (Co-founder & MD of Sysco LABS)
The COVID-19 pandemic has revealed a great deal of vulnerabilities in our world and our way of life that we never imagined we had. But in this time, technology has revealed itself to be an invaluable tool to help us to continue to meet our basic needs even as we stay home and socially distanced. Whether it is e-education for our kids, tools to help us work from home, or services that allow us to get the products that we need to survive, our reliance on technology has deepened during the pandemic, and it has accelerated the technology takeover.
The Four Stages of Pandemic Behavior
The patterns of altered behavior brought about by the virus can be divided into four stages. The Danger Zone is the period when the country goes into lockdown to try to contain the virus and flatten the curve. What follows this is the New Normal; the period in which countries try to open up a little again while continuing to keep schools closed, work from home and maintain social distancing. After that, we have the period when we adapt to the virus, we start to go back to more normal lives because we have developed a deeper understanding of how to live with the virus. Finally, after a vaccine is discovered, scaled and distributed, our behavior can return to how it was before the virus.
Post Vaccine Period: Return to normal
We have seen different companies react to this period differently, and we can predict certain trends going forward:
These companies can broadly be divided into four groups. The first are those completely unable to operate in the danger zone, such as companies in the travel, hospitality and ride sharing industries. These companies have suffered during the pandemic predominantly because the industries that they operate rely on direct services to people.
The second group are companies with low long-term stickiness. Companies that prop themselves up during the pandemic by creating a simple business that can address the needs created by the pandemic. They take advantage of the space left open by large companies that struggle to react to the crisis rapidly or effectively. Ultimately, these companies are unable to hold onto all the market share given due to a customer experience that is lacking. Larger players also catch up as the pandemic eases. Companies like small grocers making home deliveries, WhatsApp-run businesses, etc. fall into this category.
Then, there are businesses with high stickiness. These businesses see an increased patronage during the lockdown, and only experience a small drop when it ends. Ultimately, the momentum gained through the new customers won during the lockdown may allow them to continue to grow their customer base, even after the lockdown ends. These include video conferencing software like Zoom, online retailers like Walmart or Amazon, and paid online streaming services like Netflix. Companies like this may thrive as they are well positioned to provide good customer digital experiences and only increase market share from pre-COVID19 situations.
The biggest successes of all though are those new outliers whose business is based on changing consumer behaviors. Once behavior has been changed due to the lockdown, they feel far more comfortable continuing to operate that way post-lockdown. These companies include gaming company PUBG and last-mile delivery companies like China's Meituan, that have reached a $100 billion valuation during the crisis.
Two Sri Lankan companies that succeeded well in this environment are PickMe Delivery and oDoc. oDoc, a company that provides telemedicine software, saw a 374% increase in new customer registrations during the lockdown period in March growing at 10% per day. They became the official telemedicine provider for the government of Sri Lanka and released an online COVID-19 symptoms checker. While patients may opt for physical consultations in post-pandemic, the adoption of video-based consultations has increased, and some patients - now having experienced both options - may now prefer the convenience of telemedicine.
The Digitization Acceleration
So just how much has digitization increased? According to Forbes, e-commerce retail orders in the US have increased by 146% while revenue has increased by 68% during this pandemic. Amazon and Walmart have both reached their highest market caps to date at $1.23 Trillion and $376.54 Billion respectively. But it isn't just retail where e-commerce has exploded. If this trend continues, US online grocery sales are set to double by 2021 from $14.2 Billion to $29.7 Billion.
With 1.2 billion children outside the classroom, e-learning services have grown too. Google Classroom alone has experienced a 150% increase in its user base, and this is all on top of a pre-pandemic prediction that Forbes made; forecasting that the e-learning market would reach $325 Billion by 2025.
The digitization of banking has seen a significant change as well. In many countries, the use of ATMs has dropped by 60% while 63% of customers have been inclined to try out their bank's mobile application.
The rise of online gaming has been a major trend with the annual revenue generated through online gaming reaching $18 Billion. Leading games like Fortnite are earning over $2 Billion annually. Usage is up during the pandemic as the amount of non-virtual entertainment available declines.
The AI and Automation acceleration that we have been witnessing over the last few years has only accelerated during the pandemic. The use of AI to handle unforeseen loads in critical situations has been useful during the pandemic, as chat-bots have dealt with high traffic in the healthcare sector and beyond. The deployment of robotics in supply chain management has also allowed work to proceed with indirect physical involvement from human employees.
The Shorter Supply Chain
Another change that we have seen in this pandemic situation is the shortening of the supply chain. To get products to struggling consumers faster, companies have focused on simplifying their sales process and causing a merging of the B2B and B2C supply chains. Many businesses in the middle of the chain are brick and mortar establishments that have not been able to remain open in the midst of the pandemic, so manufacturers and suppliers are selling directly to consumers online. For example, Chinese cosmetics company Lin Qingxuan closed 40% of their retail outlets and converted their in-store sales staff to online influencers.
Changes to How Businesses Run
In addition to these industry level changes, it is likely that we will see changes to how businesses operate internally. Many companies were afraid to allow their employees to work remotely, fearing drops in productivity and efficiency. However, as the pandemic spread; 88% of employers encouraged their teams to work from home. Companies found that in most cases productivity did not decrease meaningfully; provided the employee had the prerequisite hardware tools at their disposal and the company had the necessary cloud architecture.
Remote work has increased so much that business apps which facilitate it reached 62 million downloads from 14-21 March, their biggest week ever. Video calls over Microsoft Teams have increased by 1000% and Zoom has reached a market capitalization of $48.78 Billion as usage went up by 3000%.
This has increased the belief in the effectiveness of working remotely. Now, remote work can mean something as simple as employees commuting less to the office, but it can have deeper consequences too. Many startups and small companies may forgo the need to have physical premises, relying on co-working spaces that can be rented out by the hour for days when they need to have meetings, and having their teams work remotely the rest of the time. Remote work can also mean that the hiring pools of companies have suddenly become global, as the geography in which your team members are located ceases to be a major consideration.
Along with this comes greater investment in cloud architecture. The use of cloud platforms to allow team members to work collaboratively regardless of where they are has proven its worth in the pandemic, and the lessons learned will continue to be valuable in a post-pandemic world.
The Strategic Role of the CTO/CIO
The role of the CTO/CIO has been traditionally seen as a support role, serving the needs of the core business. But as companies deepen the use of technology to meet customer needs, the role of the head of technology in companies will gain greater importance. CTOs and CIOs have been key players in responding to this crisis, leading the teams that have allowed business to continue to operate where possible, and creating new digital possibilities for doing business where necessary.
As more of the workforce becomes remote and the reliance on cloud infrastructure deepens, more of the workload will be handled online, increasing security concerns that this data could be hacked. It will be the responsibility of the CTO/CIOs to both spearhead this cloud transformation and ensure that it happens safely.
CTOs/CIOs will also have to play a leading role in guiding the way their organizations face future trends. The emphasis on analyzing data from within the organization and data on how the organization interacts with its external stakeholders will become a core focus of decision making in the future and tech innovation will drive how this data is collected and utilized. Likewise, the tech takeover will drive the major trends of the near future in most, if not all industries; and having a visionary CTO/CIO is vital to understanding these trends and gaining a competitive advantage.
Tech and the Customer Experience
Now although it is easy to misinterpret this as a phenomenon brought about by the pandemic, a closer analysis reveals that it is simply an acceleration of a trend that we were already witnessing: the increased use of tech to meet customer needs.
In truth it isn't a question of tech vs. non-tech, but a question of how technology can empower a company to provide a superior customer experience. In truth, Uber didn't kill the taxi business through technical wizardry, it simply increased access to cabs, provided customers with greater transparency over their fares, and a more convenient way to make bookings. Likewise, Airbnb didn't disrupt the hospitality industry through rocket science, it simply used technology to increase the availability of accommodation and offer a greater array of pricing options.
Although we may perceive the trend as a 'tech-takeover', it is really a 'customer-experience' takeover driven by technology. The shifts in cash, and the changes in customer behavior caused by the COVID-19 crisis are simply accelerating this trend. At the end of the day, the customer is still key and as a business, being able to adapt to changing behavior patterns of the customer will define the success of the company.
""Software is Eating the World"" - Marc Andreessen
As the quote from one of the founding members of Andreessen Horowitz, one of the most renowned venture capital firms in the Silicon Valley suggests, business models are changing and being disrupted by tech companies. More and more, engineers are heading companies that become industry leaders, tech companies are growing exponentially, and traditional companies are deepening the use of technology in how they serve their customers.
As the table shows, the five largest companies in the world by market cap are all tech companies: Apple ($1.4 trillion), Microsoft ($1.39 trillion), Amazon ($1.2 trillion), Alphabet ($984 billion), and Facebook ($642 billion). These companies have continued to earn revenue during the pandemic while other companies have struggled to survive. Today, they have a combined cash reserve of $458 billion; so, a likely trend is the acquisition of struggling non-tech businesses by these tech companies who will then work on transforming them into businesses that harness tech to meet their customers' needs. ""Software is eating the world"" just got accelerated.

2020-07-27,Opinion: COVID-19 is accelerating the technology takeover,,"Addressing the need to share resources and knowledge to combat the deadly coronavirus, Jack Ma, the Chinese tech billionaire and co-founder of the Alibaba tweeted: ""As members of the global community, it would be irresponsible of us to sit on the fence, panic, ignore facts or fail to act.
Speaking in reference to the devastating outbreak of the novel coronavirus that has so far killed and what the world must do to combat the deadly disease'.
So, on Sunday, Jack Ma through the Alibaba Foundation walked the talk by redeeming a pledged he made to provide aid to Africa and other nations worldwide to combat COVID-19.
The foundation has since followed up with donations of medical supplies to countries such as Japan, South Korea, the U.S., Italy, Spain, Belgium and this week landed on the continent with medical masks, test kits as well as protective suits for distribution to every country in Africa.
""We cannot assume this continent of 1.3 billion people will blissfully escape the crisis. The world cannot afford the unthinkable consequences of a COVID-19 pandemic in Africa,"" he said in a statement.
In all, he pledged a total of 1.1 million coronavirus test kits, 6 million masks and 60,000 medical protective suits and face shields for distribution to each of the 54 countries of the African continent.
As expected, the medical supplies arrived on the continent on Sunday 22 March, in Ethiopia with 1.5 million test kits, 5.4 million face masks and tens of thousands of medical supplies and distribution has started in earnest.
Ghana, yesterday took delivery of its share of 100,000 masks, 20,000 test kits and 1,000 medical protective suits. They were received on behalf of the country by the Minister of Health, Kwaku Agyeman-Manu.
It is important to note that Ghana and three other African countries including Gabon, Congo and the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC) are the latest to benefit from the third round of distribution of the medical materials.
Although there are still fewer coronavirus infections in Africa than in other parts of the world, WHO figures show that the continent now has more than 1,300 cases of COVID-19 in 43 countries and 40 deaths across the continent.
This is clear evidence that the disease is creeping into Africa and there is the need for countries on the continent to redouble their efforts, if the fate that befell other countries were not to befall us.
It is also evident that there is a lot of information, knowledge and experience now for us to share in combating the disease but it is also true that most countries on the continent have weak health infrastructure and lacked equipment.
Therefore, donations such as these can only be welcome news not only for the continent but the whole world.
Now that we have the needed medical supplies, it is time for us drawing from the experience of others to speedily and accurately test and provide adequate personal protective equipment for medical professionals which the experts say, are the most effective way of preventing the spread of the virus.
While we comment Jack Ma and his foundation for the gesture we urge all to see the availability of the items as the beginning redoubling of efforts to contain COVID-19","COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (91%); VIRUSES (91%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); PROTECTIVE CLOTHING (88%); EPIDEMICS (78%); GLOBALIZATION (78%); MEDICAL CHARITIES (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (77%); DEMOCRACIES (73%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (73%); Ghana (%); Coronavirus (%); Health and Medicine (%)

2020-03-26,We Need to Take Action Now to Contain COVID-19 [opinion],,"The details of how the billions of naira donated under the Nigerian Private Sector Relief Fund Against COVID 19 (CACOVID) was spent remain hazy and unaccounted for till date.
Worldwide evidence of large-scale corruption during the pandemic affected the resources destined to fight it. Transparency International found that five months into the pandemic, the government purchased some goods at 25 times the original prize. Corruption in service delivery was identified in more than thirty countries.
The outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic took the world unaware, tested the resilience of global health systems, and almost brought countries with ill-equipped health systems to collapse. It brought unprecedented disruptions in the worldwide supply chain that precipitated upheavals in society. As of early September, about 605 million persons have been infected by the virus, leading to about 6.5 million deaths globally. The coronavirus was novel, as well as the interventions to contain it. Even as the virus was raging, many citizens were very doubtful of the sincerity of government efforts due to the low public trust in government institutions. For a country like Nigeria, where government corruption is rampant, public distrust is deep, fueled by past experiences of decades of failed promises. Declining trust was one of the critical factors that affected the country's overall response to the pandemic.
Just Like Ebola, Containment Measures Did Not Produce the Expected Results
Although the pandemic has been devastating to the health and economy of the world, corruption worsened it. There were reported cases of artificial inflation, the proliferation of fake and counterfeit goods and wastage of public resources under several guises in the name of COVID responses. This is in addition to the fact that corruption in the health sector already costs the world an estimated $500 billion per year, with severe consequences on access, quality and efficiency of health services. Governments made rapid policy decisions and incurred huge public expenditures to fight the pandemic. Just like the case of the Ebola crisis in 2013, where about $1 billion in international public and private funds were disbursed to contain the pandemic, corruption contributed to the mismanagement of funds and diversion of relief supplies compromised containment measures.
COVID-19 has left a legacy of rising poverty and widening inequality. According to estimates from the World Bank, 97 more people will be living on less than $1.90 in 2021 due to the pandemic. Documented corrupt practices during the COVID-19 pandemic include grand corruption schemes involving highly placed political actors, petty corruption involving service delivery personnel and corruption in procurement and contracting processes. Many emergency scenarios are characterised by fast responses and lax checks and balances. The government loosened the regulatory environment to expedite responses.
The details of how the billions of naira donated under the Nigerian Private Sector Relief Fund Against COVID 19 (CACOVID) was spent remain hazy and unaccounted for till date. The Nigerian government's claim that it paid N5 billion worth of palliatives to the transportation sector is still surrounded by controversy. Another N56 billion was allegedly disbursed to small and medium-scale enterprises as a survival fund.
Hastened Procurement and Waived Processes Provided Fertile Ground For Corruption
In many countries with weak institutions, the response to the virus provided new opportunities to exploit the weaknesses in the system to divert funds and food supplies away from the ordinary people who need them most. In the bid to hasten procurement, the usual processes, such as open competition and scrutiny, were waived to obtain essential supplies quickly. Justifiably, many governments had to act in haste without verifying suppliers or determining fair prizes. This allowed dishonest merchants and collaborators to bring in faulty products. There were cases of informal payments, favouritism and nepotism.
Worldwide evidence of large-scale corruption during the pandemic affected the resources destined to fight it. Transparency International found that five months into the pandemic, the government purchased some goods at 25 times the original prize. Corruption in service delivery was identified in more than thirty countries. The sense of urgency, increase in demand, and shortage of essential supplies like ventilators and personal protection equipment (PPE) necessitated the relaxation of checks and balances. It caused a strain on the global supply chain, making them vulnerable to corruption. Many contracts were issued without competitive bids.
Details of Expenditure of Resources Mobilised Remain Sketchy Amidst Many Blunders
Massive resources were mobilised nationally and globally to address both what was a health crisis and its economic side effects. For instance, Nigeria received $3.4 billion in emergency support to address the COVID-19 pandemic from the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Furthermore, a total of $6 billion was raised by other donors as complementary support to the Nigerian government. The World Bank approved an additional $400 million credit as additional financing to support vaccine acquisition. Official sources said that N20,000 each was distributed to 2.6 million households between January and April 2020 under the conditional cash transfer programme. The details of how the billions of naira donated under the Nigerian Private Sector Relief Fund Against COVID 19 (CACOVID) was spent remain hazy and unaccounted for till date. The Nigerian government's claim that it paid N5 billion worth of palliatives to the transportation sector is still surrounded by controversy. Another N56 billion was allegedly disbursed to small and medium-scale enterprises as a survival fund. The distribution of cash grants and food support to food-insecure communities was wrought with irregularities.
Media reports indicate how the disbursement of the N50 billion COVID-19 loan to small businesses was negatively affected by a lack of transparency and inefficiency. Stakeholders further complained that the implementation of the N1 trillion meant to be disbursed to manufacturers fell short of expectations.
Palliatives Were Diverted for Partisan Purposes Away from those Who Needed Them Most
Civil society organisations like BudgIT revealed how palliatives meant for the public were hijacked by politicians and distributed only among party loyalists. Although a six-month expiry date is required for imported vaccines, the story of how about one million doses of vaccines were procured by the Nigerian government just before their expiration still remains a mystery. Although official sources confirmed that N500 billion was injected into the budget to fund emergency expenditure during the pandemic, there were no detailed disclosures about the processes undertaken to procure the items mentioned. The Independent Corrupt Practices and Other Related Offences Commission (ICPC) confirmed discrepancies and infractions in the procurements and payments made by government agencies after the disbursement of COVID-19 funds.
Anecdotal Evidence of Corruption Points To the Need for More Scrutiny
Anecdotal evidence indicates that corruption affected the response to the pandemic, but the extent must be determined. Prominent human rights lawyer Femi Falana decried the hoarding of palliatives and accused the Nigerian government of being neither transparent nor accountable in their management of the pandemic. Media reports indicate how the disbursement of the N50 billion COVID-19 loan to small businesses was negatively affected by a lack of transparency and inefficiency. Stakeholders further complained that the implementation of the N1 trillion meant to be disbursed to manufacturers fell short of expectations. All of these point to the need to comprehensively interrogate and evaluate the response to the pandemic to bring out lessons for the future. Civil society groups have pushed for this in the past, and one had gone to court seeking relief to compel the Central Bank of Nigeria to account for how donations received were spent. Many people remain concerned, while others have called for either a probe or a comprehensive audit. Either way, it is clear that new investments should be made to strengthen our institutions and enhance relevant anti-corruption policies. For instance, Nigeria's whistle-blower protection policy needs to be more robust and citizen-friendly. Specific multi-stakeholder initiatives that include civil society and the searchlight of transparency in the health sector could be potentially helpful.

COVID-19: The World Opinion Right Now is COVID-19 is a Human-to-Human Disease Partnership between Trupanion, The Association for Animal Welfare Advancement (AAWA), the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA), and Maddie's Shelter Medicine Program at the University of Florida address more than 10,000 veterinary and shelter professionals in exclusive webinar / EIN News / -- SEATTLE, March 29, 2020 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Leading experts in animal health recently joined forces to provide guidance to veterinary and shelter professionals around the globe on pets and the current pandemic.  Brought together by Trupanion , the leader in medical insurance for cats & dogs, the experts spoke on a wide range of topics in response to COVID-19 with the underlying theme that, to date, this is a people-to-people disease and that pet-to-people transmission is unlikely.
“The purpose of this webinar was to bring our community together to align in confronting a global enemy through education and fact-based insight,” said Dr. Steve Weinrauch, BVMS, MRCVS, chief veterinary officer at Trupanion, Founder of MightyVet and webinar moderator. “These forces aligned can achieve great things.” Michael Lappin, DVM, PhD, DACVIM (SAIM), and Chair of the WSAVA One Health Committee commented that the current situation is changing not just day by day but minute by minute, but for now, this is a human-to-human disease. “The world opinion right now is there is no evidence that pets can transmit COVID-19 to people,” said Dr. Lappin. Lappin noted that while more data is needed, the potential fomite transmission should be low. To date, there has been no documented transmission from a dog or cat to a human. The original inference that pets may be affected by the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-19) causing COVID-19 started when two of 17 dogs in Hong Kong housed with owners with COVID-19 tested positive for the RNA of the virus.  One of the dogs ultimately developed serum antibodies suggesting that subclinical infection did occur.  None of the eight cats isolated in Hong Kong were positive at the time the webinar was recorded and none of the dogs became clinically ill. Shortly after the webinar was recorded, a cat with transient vomiting and diarrhea housed with a COVID-19 patient in Belgium tested positive for RNA of the virus. Studies are ongoing to determine whether the cat was infected with the virus or just exposed from sharing the same environment. Experts in animal welfare and shelter medicine agreed that there is no evidence at this time that pets can transmit COVID-19 to people; yet critical steps must be taken to navigate this unprecedented time. “As soon as this pandemic reared its ugly head, leaders came together, they saw the writing on the wall and immediately mobilized,” said Jim Tedford, president and CEO for The Association for Animal Welfare Advancement (AAWA). “Working together we have come up with global strategies that would work for any animal sheltering organization, anywhere.” Shelter medicine expert, Dr. Julie Levy, also pointed to five critical steps that shelters should be taking as they navigate this unprecedented time, including the need to preserve a shelter's critical functions. “Animal shelters and animal control officers are first responders to meeting societal needs,” said Dr. Levy, DVM, PhD, DACVIM, DABVP, Fran Marino Endowed Professor of Shelter Medicine Education at the University of Florida. “It's imperative that we reinforce with policy makers and elected officials that animal shelters, animal control officers, and veterinary clinics are essential services that need to have the opportunity to stay open when shutdowns occur.  However, these organizations should suspend non-emergency activity to support public health initiatives calling for the public and personnel to stay at home.” The webinar, co-hosted by Covetrus, was free and RACE approved for veterinary professionals. More than 10,000 animal health professionals have viewed or registered for the webinar in under 72 hours. To view a playback of the webinar on Facebook visit MightyVet or Not One More Vet . A second webinar to discuss additional information and updates to any new developments will take place the week of March 30, 2020. About Trupanion

2020-03-29,COVID-19: The World Opinion Right Now is COVID-19 is a Human-to-Human Disease,,"The following information was released by the U.S. Air Forces Europe:
By Staff Sgt. Devin Nothstine, 435th CRG
The 435th Contingency Response Group conducted airborne operations to maintain proficiency and qualifications at Ramstein Air Base, Germany, April 7-8.
The 435th CRG is the only contingency response force in the Air Force that maintains an airborne insertion capability. Adding such a vital capability to the U.S. Forces in Europe-Air Forces Africa retinue requires CRG Airmen to maintain currency in training as well as remain ready, resilient Airmen who can execute the mission anytime, anyplace.
The medical team assigned to the 435th Contingency Response Support Squadron met with the paratroopers in the morning to first ensure they were in good health in order to perform their airborne jumps. Independent Duty Medical Technicians provided a coronavirus disease 2019 preflight screening and briefed risk mitigation techniques prior to boarding the aircraft.
Our IDMTs are the front line of medical care for a majority of our missions and exercises, said Capt. Talon Miner, 435th CRSS director of medical operations. Our people are the reason we are able to do the things we do and why we are able to do them so well.
Proactive measures limited exposure and spread of COVID-19 while still allowing them to train.
We are taking extra precautions to mitigate the risk of COVID-19 transmission during this global pandemic, Miner said. We work closely with several units including 86th Medical Group and 37th Airlift Squadron to ensure we are all following the latest guidance to keep our members protected and healthy.
While COVID-19 is a threat, it must be treated just like any other threat: training will limit the degradation of Air Forces readiness, responsiveness and lethality. The 435th CRG continues to take every step to ensure the wellness of their Airmen while also safeguarding their national mission capabilities.
There arent a lot of units that are jumping in the Air Force right now, said Maj. Doug Dinkins, 435th Security Forces Squadron commander. We want to continue to execute these operations. Thats why we are going through extra precautions to ensure our members safety and health stay as a top priority.
Each Airman wore protective cloth masks, disposal rubber gloves and had a heightened awareness of the physical distancing regulations during training. The 435th CRG Airmen are on a 72-hour response time to answer any call which emphasizes the importance of their health.
We ensure our nation, partners, allies and those who would choose to be our adversary understand that it is impossible to deny the employment of airpower anywhere in this area of operation, said Col. Jason Terry, 435th CRG commander.
Airborne operations provide combatant commanders added flexibility when they request assistance to open an airbase in uncertain austere environments.
The team of airborne qualified Airmen can drop into an airfield and then rapidly assess it for aircraft suitability, said Master Sgt. Jim Burke, 435th Contingency Response Squadron operations superintendent. Operations like these demonstrate the continued readiness of the 435th CRG and remind all parties that we still have the ability to insert paratroopers into any place at any time even during a global pandemic.
Military free fall requires a skill set which can diminish if its not continually practiced, Burke added.
The jumps allow paratroopers to assess and hone their skillsets while under canopy and control parachute landing fall procedures. A lot of coordination goes into planning airborne training opportunities. The 37th AS and 86th Operational Support Squadron compliment this training by partnering with the CRG to provide airlift for proficiency jumps over Ramstein Air Base.
Leveraging partnerships is of critical importance to the 435th CRG, said Maj. Brad Seehawer, 435th CRS operations officer. These jumps are a direct reflection of the outstanding support weve received from the 37th Airlift Squadron, 86th Operations Support Squadron, 721st Air Mobility Operations Group, and 5th Quartermaster Theater Aerial Delivery Company. We wouldnt be able to be who we are without the support they provide.
The CRG diligently works to find a way to get a yes to continue training during difficult times for their units; and for good reason.
Airborne members must make at least one exit out of a high-performance aircraft to stay qualified, said Staff Sgt. Mark Melchiori, 435th SFS jump master. Wearing masks, keeping a 6-foot physical distance and following the extra precautions doesnt change the way we train but adds another level of safety.
Its vitally important the CRG conduct these operations so they can continually provide expeditionary airfields on demand with agility and lethality.
Every unit in the Air Force can take on a difficult task, but the impossible tasks are reserved for the light, lean and lethal Airmen of the CRG, said Chief Master Sgt. Carey Jordan, 435th CRG superintendent.
Together, the military will adapt to combat any threat. The COVID-19 pandemic is no different. The safety precautions were put into place to relieve any stressors caused by this global threat and to protect the health of the community. The U.S. Air Force remains committed to rapid, global mobility in order to safeguard and preserve U.S. national interests as well as the interests of its allies and partners.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); AIR FORCES (90%); ARMED FORCES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); US AIR FORCE (90%); SAFETY (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (76%); SKYDIVING (74%); PANDEMICS (73%); CORONAVIRUSES (70%); PROFESSIONAL WORKERS (70%); RISK MANAGEMENT (68%); TECHNICIANS & TECHNOLOGICAL WORKERS (68%); VIRUSES (68%)

2020-04-09,"COVID-19 OPS: LIGHT, LEAN, LETHAL",,"Jul 09, 2020( City Limits: http://www.citylimits.org Delivered by Newstex) ;;;; Seattle Municipal Archives Firland Sanitorium, Seattle, in 1920. On February 1st, 1901, New York City's Board of Health marshalled 125 doctors and 125 police for a vaccination raid[1] on an Italian neighborhood where officials had uncovered a smallpox outbreak. That night, the doctors went door to door vaccinating everyone, and taking away anyone they found with the trademark sores. The police were stationed at all the building exits to catch people who tried to flee.Some residents still got away, but several doctors managed to chase down a man in his pajamas who tried to escape down an alley by 114th street. When they caught him, the doctors found he was already vaccinated for smallpox. 
The man spoke no English, and didn't know the purpose of the raid. He ran to get away from violent government officials. CityViews[2] are readers' opinions, not those of City Limits. Add your voice today![3] The healthcare system has long played an important role in policing people's bodies, forcing vulnerable people to weigh their health against their autonomy. Babies die[4] because pregnant drug users are afraid to access prenatal care. Trans people don't call suicide hotlines[5] because an operator might contact emergency services, and get them taken to a psych ward against their will. Immigrants forego healthcare[6] for fear of deportation.Amid the pandemic, lawmakers are making this problem even worse by criminalizing sickness itself. The Yonkers Police Department[7] is hoovering up the addresses of everyone who tests positive for covid-19. New York City's contact tracing data could easily end up[8] in the hands of the NYPD. Some jurisdictions are fining, arresting, and even jailing[9] sick people who break isolation orders. These policies are part of a longstanding pattern with dangerous consequences for public health. If cooperating with contact tracers might mean getting surveilled by the police, people won't cooperate. If testing positive for COVID-19 puts people at risk of being criminalized, many won't get tested. When healthcare is bound up with policing, more people get sick, and more die.* * * *In 1911, Washington opened Firland Sanatorium, one of the first facilities in the state for people with tuberculosis. Firland, built on the outskirts of Seattle, filled a clear need and soon had a waiting list. The facility was able to be choosy about its clientele—its management preferred women who had dependent children[10].After World War II, the state reorganized and expanded its network of sanatoria. Firland moved into a building in Seattle with more than five times its old capacity. By 1948, there were enough beds in Washington for everyone with tuberculosis.Firland had long rejected 'Skid Roaders[11]' who sought treatment back when space was tight, but now homeless people with tuberculosis were finally able to get a bed. These new patients were sometimes unruly. Public health officials were particularly concerned about people who left the facility before the end of their course of treatment, which put them at risk of developing a strain of tuberculosis resistant to antibiotics.Washington had a 1903 law[12] on its books authorizing prison-style isolation of sick people who endangered public health, but until then, the state never had enough beds to bring it into force. Firland moved quickly to take advantage of the old law to control their new patients. By 1949, the facility had built one of the first locked wards in a sanatorium in the country. Administrators expected to only use the cells occasionally, as a last resort. But by 1960, Firland was jailing 30 percent[13] of its patients.These policies alienated patients—several tried to burn down Firland—and deterred people with tuberculosis from seeking treatment. Those people needed to be hunted down and cured by force, argued Washington public health officials in a 1952 paper[14]. Every 'flophouse district' had to be canvassed for tuberculosis, and the sick needed to be locked in medicalized jails.'It will be necessary for every metropolitan area to seek cases 'on the other side of the tracks,'' the public health officials wrote. 'In consequence it will be mandatory to set up in every city a facility for the detention of this type of patient.' * * * *On June 23, 1987, Joseph Markowski tried to grab a gun from a bank guard and yelled 'kill me! Kill me! I have AIDS![15]' He was psychotic and suicidal; he had tried to kill himself at least six other times[16] over the previous four months. When police arrived, they happened to find a receipt in Markowski's pocket from a local blood bank, and contacted the company in case he returned to give blood again. Soon after his release from a psychiatric unit Markowski went back to the same blood bank, and police arrested him. Markowski was homeless—he gave blood to earn $9[17], not to give other people AIDS. Blood donations were screened for AIDS anyway, and California didn't even have a law barring people who knew they had AIDS from giving blood.In spite of the harmlessness and legality of Markowski's actions, The Los Angeles District Attorney decided to charge him with attempted murder. 'We can either throw up our hands and say there's no law to deal with this or do something to try to protect the public[18],' said DA Ira Reiner.The case was part of a wave of prosecutions[19] of people who knew they had HIV. Consensual sex, spitting, biting, and donating blood abruptly became serious crimes for people who had tested positive for the disease. Accordingly, many vulnerable people chose to not get tested—knowing one's status was a legal liability. HIV infected many more people as a result.* * * *Criminalizing sickness fulfills lawmakers' desire to 'do something,' as Reiner put it. Society's fear of disease is redirected onto a handful of sick, hapless, and vulnerable people. Controlling their bodies stands in for controlling disease itself. These punitive rituals harm public health—sick people quickly learn to act as though they aren't, which worsens the spread of sickness and death.The fix is simple: healthcare must be completely confidential and consensual. It's outrageous that it isn't already.F.T. Green is a reporter based in Toronto. His website is ftgreen.xyz[20].

2020-07-09,Opinion: Criminalizing COVID-19 Will Only Worsen its Toll,,"April 16 -- Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Government of Singapore issued the following news release:
Op Ed, jointly submitted by Her Excellency Ms Shirley Ayorkor Botchwey (MP), Her Excellency Ms Retno L.P. Marsudi, Her Excellency Dr Katrin Eggenberger, Her Excellency Ms Ine Eriksen Sreide, His Excellency Dr Vivian Balakrishnan, His Excellency Mr Ignazio Cassis, the Foreign Ministers of Ghana, Indonesia, Liechtenstein, Norway, Singapore and Switzerland:
""We the peoples of the United Nations..."" reads the immortal opening line of the Charter of the United Nations (UN). It paints a picture of the creation of an organisation from the ashes of WWII. A coming together of nations to overcome adversity.
Now 75 years on, in the face of a global pandemic, we must again live up to our founding principles. As the Secretary-General of the UN, Antonio Guterres has underlined, COVID-19 is the greatest test that we have faced since the formation of the United Nations. A virus that is oblivious to national boundaries or immigration procedures in its trajectory of destruction and pain across our world. A formidable threat to the human race, this challenge undoubtedly requires a multilateral response for meaningful impact.
This is why our countries Ghana, Indonesia, Liechtenstein, Norway, Singapore and Switzerland have come together at the UN to draft the first resolution on the fight against COVID-19 (A/RES/74/270 ""Global Solidarity to fight the COVID-19"").
While a resolution on the given crisis of the day is to be expected from the UN, this one represents much more. It is a signal of global solidarity. It is a show of force.
It is the first intergovernmental statement from the UN on COVID-19 but it certainly will not be the last. This resolution is an overdue first step, to convey a message to people around the world that the UN is responding to this crisis.
Beyond the words of the General Assembly, we must now give our full support to the UN's operational work at the service of the countries and the people most in need of international cooperation. This human crisis has proven to be a monumental national challenge for every government, to re-allocate their resources, and reformulate their priorities. While on the frontline, our health care professionals and other essential workers are risking their lives - literally, to save humanity.
The UN system, in particular the World Health Organisation (WHO), is playing a central role in mobilising and coordinating the worldwide response to this pandemic and supporting national efforts. Beyond the short term, the WHO, in addition to addressing urgent humanitarian needs, is also dealing with the inevitable long-term economic, social and developmental consequences of this crisis, and building future resilience.
The UN with its convening power, and resources on the ground is best placed to bring together not just every country, but also every possible partner, from civil society to the private sector. To overcome this health emergency with a spirit of solidarity, we need to promote action without stigma or discrimination, and to ensure that no one in our society is left behind.
It is imperative to underscore that personal and individual efforts are required to complement national and international response to the pandemic. The world's population is, therefore, reminded that the first frontline of the fight against COVID-19 is your front door. Hence, the call on people to stay at home for better containment. It is vitally important that every individual adheres to the social distancing and enhanced hygiene protocols.
The challenges we face remain vast. Nevertheless, the resolution adopted on 2 April 2020 expresses our optimism. We have put on record our conviction that the unprecedented crisis caused by the COVID-19 pandemic can be mitigated, and successfully reversed, through leadership and sustained global cooperation. We hope this resolution is one of ""we the peoples"", towards a new kind of multilateralism, where the UN again rises to face a global challenge with a truly united response.

New Delhi: Maharashtra Chief Minister Uddhav Thackeray will meet the COVID-19 task force today to assess the situation in the state.
The CM will chair the meeting at 12:30 pm to seek opinions from the experts before easing further curbs.
Meanwhile, the state's weekly positivity rate has dropped to 3.8 per cent indicating a downward trend of the second COVID-19 wave. Last week, the positivity rate was 4.36 per cent.
As per the reports, Pune, Thane, Kolhapur, Sangli and Satara together account for about 60 per cent of the total active cases while the state's 24.84 per cent active patients come from Mumbai, Ahmednagar, Solapur, Beed and Ratnagiri.
84.80 per cent of the state's active cases come from these 10 districts.
Today, in the COVID task force meet, Chief Minister will take the final call on our suggestions. We have suggested that COVID relaxation should be given to 25 districts where the positivity rate is much lower than the state average: Maharashtra Health Minister Rajesh Tope  pic.twitter.com/VLemt6kbNT - ANI (@ANI)  July 29, 2021 
On Wednesday, Maharashtra had recorded 6,857 new cases with 286 deaths. The state's COVID-19 tally has reached 6,282,914, while the death toll stands at 132,145.
Several senior ministers including opposition leaders are of opinion that the curbs should be relaxed wherever possible. Last week, Deputy Chief Minister Ajit Pawar had said that shop timings might be extended till 7 pm in Pune.
He also said that the government was mulling giving relief to people who have received both doses of the COVID-19 vaccine.
Opposition leader Devendra Fadnavis has also written to the CM to unlock cities like Nagpur where coronavirus where caseload is less.
On Wednesday, Maharashtra Cabinet Minister Aslam Shaikh said that fully vaccinated passengers could be allowed to travel unrestricted in suburban train services within two to three days.
Talking to ANI, Shaikh said in the state cabinet meeting, a detailed discussion took place over the opening of Mumbai local train and Brihanmumbai Electric Supply and Transport (BEST) buses for fully vaccinated individuals.
""As a Minister, I am also of the view that person whose two doses are completed should be allowed to travel in Mumbai local, we have also informed Chief Minister about this. After studying the report by the task force, a decision on Mumbai local will be taken in next two to three days,"" he added.
He also informed that timings in restaurants must be increased and a decision will be taken soon.

2021-07-29,CM Uddhav Thackeray to seek opinion from COVID-19 task force today on easing COVID-19 curbs in Maharashtra,,"(TNSPol) -- Concerned Women for America issued the following news release:
Attorney General Jason Miyares issued a legal opinion today that Virginia colleges cannot require their students to receive the COVID-19 vaccine as a general condition of students' enrollment or in-person attendance.
Miyares highlights the opinion that ""as recognized in the prior opinion, '[t]here is no question that the General Assembly could enact a statute requiring the COVID-19 vaccine for in-person school attendance.' As of this writing, it has not done so. Over the course of the COVID-19 pandemic, the General Assembly has amended other statutes to address pandemic-related issues.""
Penny Nance, President and CEO of Concerned Women for America (CWA), gave the following statement responding to today's release:
""Attorney General Miyares' opinion proves that he respects the rule of law and listens to students, parents, and school employees. His first opinion as Virginia AG is a huge step in the right direction to personal freedom in education in the Commonwealth of Virginia. No student should be denied admission to an institution or admittance to class because of their vaccine status.
""Nothing in Virginia law empowers public universities to make such requirements, and therefore we urge them to immediately rescind their policies: https://vtx.vt.edu/articles/2021/08/president-vaccine-statement.html
""We are grateful to Gov. Youngkin and Attorney General Miyares and urge them to continue prioritizing education, parents, and students in Virginia and continue to push back on the authoritarian establishment.
""Concerned Women for America applauds Attorney General Miyares and will continue to stand up for individual freedom and civil rights for Americans.""

2022-01-29,Concerned Women Applaud Va. A.G. Miyares for His Public Universities COVID-19 Vaccines Opinion,,"rendering the religion as an archaic, violent, and whatever ill one could think of the religion, COVID-19 pandemic has presented itself as a key example for the world to see Islam in a different light than the Fox News, CNN, NPR, and BCC's portrayal of Islam. Many Western networks' discussion about Islam with so called ""Islamic experts"" is without actually inviting the scholars of Quran and Sunnah (the saying and actions of Allah's Messenger, Muhammad, Peace be Upon Him) to truly explain the religion to laymen. As a result, the West and some nations around the globe continue to misinterpret Islam and its rulings, which are not just for Muslims but the entire mankind, should they choose to understand the religion and adhere to its principles. So how does COVID-19 pandemic and Islam's prescribed ways, especially Islamic ruling on Halal (permissible) food related?
COVID-19, also known as SARS-CoV-2 first emerged in Wuhan, China. According to the Center for Disease Control (CDC), ""Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is caused by a new coronavirus first identified in Wuhan, China, in December 2019."" Although the exact source of virus and its precise location of emergence is still being investigated, the World Health Organization (WHO) reported ""Environmental samples taken from this market in December 2019 tested positive for SARS-CoV-2, further suggesting that the market in Wuhan City was the source of this outbreak or played a role in the initial amplification of the outbreak.""
Furthermore, the Humane Society of United States noted, ""The strongest evidence of the virus's origin points to a section of the Huanan open-air market where more than 75 species of stressed wildlife were stacked in wire cages and slaughtered on-site for buyers. ""You almost couldn't design a more perfect setting for the transmission of disease,"" says Teresa Telecky, HSI vice president for wildlife. ""Animals are crowded together, and you have all these fluids—blood, saliva, feces."" The live animals, edible and non-edible, the food being sold and eaten in Wuhan and similar markets alike, it brings attention to the idea that Islam's legislations are with a meaning and a purpose, and if mankind had adhered to what the Creator (the One and Only, without any partners or associates) legislated, COVID-19 could have been preventable. This is what continues to be amiss in the West and some Asian countries that see Islam as a violent and an outdated religion whereas Islamic ruling, not just on Halal food but many other aspects of life stand the test of time because of its wisdom, backed by intellect and science.
In Islam, Allah commands those who have believe in Him as the sole Creator (One and Only, worthy of Worship alone), ""O you who have believed, eat from good things which We have provided for you, and be grateful to Allah if it is [indeed] Him that you worship"" (al Baqarah 2:172). In another verse of Quran, Allah commands, ""Say: Have you seen what Allah has sent down to you for provision of which you have made [some] lawful and [some] unlawful? Say: Has Allah permitted you [to do so], or do you invent [something] about Allah"" (Yoonas 10:59).
Islam prescribes a very defined legislation on food and commands its followers to eat what is considered pure and edible, food that human body is made to tolerate. Under Islamic jurisprudence, pure food is defined as being free from any filth or poison. Additionally, one of the Islamic legislations pertaining Halal food is that the animal is not killed by strangling or electric shock or drowning in water. Whether a Muslim or a non-Muslim who slaughters or kills an animal in inhumane way, it is impermissible for him to consume such animals.
The animals being sold at the Wuhan market and many alike contain animals that are impure and poisonous. The list of animals includes but are not limited to: Peacocks, Snakes, Crocodiles, Kangaroos, Squirrels, Snails, Foxes, Pheasants, Civet cats, Cicadas, Frogs, Centipedes, Hedgehogs, Bats, etc. All these types of wildlife are either poisonous or constrain certain bacteria that can cause serious sickness or death. Why did it take COVID-19 for the Chinese government and the world to realize that they must ban the sale of wildlife that is impure and an easy carrier of deadly viruses? In a world that has refused to learn about Islam and refused to look into principles on the permissibly of various matters that range from maintaining hygiene to eating pure types of food to enjoining good and forbidding all types of evil, the world would have benefitted quite a lot by learning from the Islamic jurisprudence on what Halal means.
With Halal food legislation clearly defined in the Quran, the final prophet Muhammad (Peace be upon him) also taught the very message to the mankind. Allah's final Messenger, Muhammad (Peace be upon him) stated that, ""The Messenger of Allah (ﷺ) said, ""Allah the Almighty is Good and accepts only that which is good. And verily Allah has commanded the believers to do that which He has commanded the Messengers. So the Almighty has said: ""O (you) Messengers! Eat of the tayyibat [all kinds of halal (legal) foods] and perform righteous deeds (40 Hadith, Nawawi, 10). Some of key benefits of Halal food include:
Complete animal care, which entails keeping animals clean and fedSick animals are considered impermissible for consumption and must be kept away from healthy animalsHumane way of slaughtering the animal for consumption, requiring complete drainage of blood from the animal bodyHalal meat is healthier and less prone to contamination; hence, no bacteria growthHealthy and balanced consumption of meat, which means Halal meat supports the immune system and metabolic function because of its cleanliness
COVID-19 has resulted in 1.47M deaths, plunged the global economy into a recession, shut down all activities that we once considered normal—all because of poor decisions to eat impressible foods that people made permissible for themselves despite knowing how filthy and deadly the wild animals are for consumption. Islam, if its legislation were given a serious consideration and respect from the mindset of understanding it rather than attacking it with false propaganda, the world would not have to face such a dangerous pandemic today. As our society moves forward and ignores Islam and its wisdom in all aspects of the life, such pandemics and various other types of diseases will continue to spread. Islam legislates very practical solutions to resolving many matters of our life. It should not take pandemics and spread of fatal diseases to realize that certain wildlife has to be banned for consumption or certain acts or behaviors have to be stopped. Islam differs from other religion such that it calls for balance whereas other religions are on an extreme end of the spectrum, either calling for veganism or allowing for all types of food to be permissible. It is about time that world directs its attention to learning about Islam, thinking and believing that this religion does actually offer great practical solutions to many issues that our society faces either through its commandments.

2020-12-03,Concept Of Halal Food And Why It Matters Amidst COVID-19 – OpEd,,"We must confront one of the most serious healthcare crises to hit the world in recent times as a global challenge, together, not as individual countries
In the battle against COVID-19, we all have a common goal: to save lives, reopen our societies and rebuild our economies. New diagnostic tests, treatments and vaccines offer the best hope of achieving this - but only if they are deployed when and where they are needed most. This is not just the right thing to do; it is the smart thing to do. Against a foe that respects no borders, national solutions are bound to fall short.
This week, global leaders are meeting at the United Nations General Assembly to discuss the global solution that is here for the taking. We call on world leaders to use significant moments like UNGA to commit investment in - and cooperation with - the ACT-Accelerator programme, a global push to develop COVID-19 tests, treatments and vaccines. By doing so we are leading our people and the world directly towards the exit of this crisis by replacing fear with hope.
Our two countries, Norway and South Africa, may lie at different ends of the planet - and stand on different rungs of the economic ladder - but we have a long-standing relationship and we rely on each other to escape from this crisis. The same is true for every country on Earth.
Countries that only focus on ensuring supplies of vaccines, drugs and diagnostics for their own populations must wake up to the fact that they risk delaying the end of the pandemic for everyone. The pandemic transcends national borders - our efforts should be aligned to fight this pandemic collectively. Vaccines, drugs and diagnostics must be made available for all in need. If not, we risk delaying the end of the pandemic for everyone.
In our shared desire for a rapid global solution, earlier this month we co-chaired the inaugural meeting of the ACT-Accelerator Facilitation Council with over 30 heads of state and ministers, economic cooperation groups, international partners and civil society. Launched in April by the World Health Organization with the European Commission, G20 countries and other partners, the ACT-Accelerator offers a joint exit strategy from the COVID crisis based on global cooperation and equitable access. Crucially, it promises excellent value for money.
The unprecedented speed at which ACT-Accelerator is accelerating the development and rollout of new tools is testament to the incredible advances in science and technology of recent years and shows what can be achieved when we work together.
These tools play an equally important role in ending the pandemic. Diagnostics are the eyes and ears of the COVID response - and are essential to limit the spread of the virus. Better, more effective treatments for all stages of disease are essential to prevent death and serious illness. A safe and effective vaccine will protect populations, in particular high risk and vulnerable groups.
As the world awaits the results of large-scale clinical trials on vaccines and therapeutics, it is vital that we take the opportunity to ensure that they will be used to maximum effect.
Immunising people in a limited number of high-income countries will not fix the problem. In fact, new research suggests that unequal distribution of vaccines could result in almost twice as many COVID-19 deaths than if the same volume of vaccines were shared out equitably. That has grave implications for countries at all income levels in both North and South alike.
In an inter-connected world, tackling the virus everywhere is our best chance not only of saving the largest number of lives but also of restoring social and economic activity globally and nationally. Until the threat of COVID-19 recedes, the global economy will continue to suffer, supply chains will remain broken and travel will be disrupted.
What is more, we risk losing decades of development progress, with 100 million more people around the world facing the possibility of being driven into poverty, millions of children in low-and middle-income countries lacking access to schooling, and healthcare systems across resource-poor regions in danger of being overwhelmed.
Resurgences of the virus now evident in many countries underscore the precarious state of affairs. With up to 95% of the global population still at risk of catching the virus, there is a continuing danger that COVID-19 will flow back to countries currently under control - whatever unilateral steps they may have taken to suppress transmission - creating more economic uncertainty and shocks.
In just five months, the ACT-Accelerator and its four pillars have built an unrivalled research and development portfolio of tests, treatments and vaccines, alongside an advance purchasing system to get them to the places they are needed, and a global distribution network to get them to the people who require them. It is the ideal mechanism to deliver a coordinated global response by bringing together governments, health bodies, scientists, businesses, civil society and philanthropists.
The ACT-Accelerator has shown us the potential for an exit from this crisis, but a gear change in funding is necessary if we are to reach that door. To date, just $2.7 billion has been given to its work - enough to ensure a robust start-up phase, but this covers less than 10% of the overall needs. To meet the goal of producing and delivering 2 billion vaccine doses, 245 million treatments and 500 million diagnostic tests, world leaders must use the window of opportunity to scale-up the initiative over the next three months.
The investment case is compelling. With the global economy expected to contract by $7 trillion in 2020 alone, fully financing the remaining $35 billion needed by partners of the ACT-Accelerator to shorten the duration of the crisis would pay for itself in just 36 hours once global travel and trade alone are restored. The alternative path of ""vaccine nationalism"", and a lack of innovation for and access to effective tests and treatments, would hold up the recovery of all countries.
We must confront one of the most serious healthcare crises to hit the world in recent times as a global challenge, together, not as individual countries. The case for united action has never been stronger. Nor has it been more urgent.
Prime Minister Erna Solberg of Norway and President Cyril Ramaphosa of South Africa are co-chairs of the ACT-Accelerator Facilitation Council.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); VACCINES (90%); ALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPS (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); EPIDEMICS (89%); NEGATIVE NEWS (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLE (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH (88%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (78%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (78%); INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS & BODIES (78%); MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS, SCREENING & TESTING (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (77%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (77%); TERRITORIAL & NATIONAL BORDERS (77%); DRUG FAST TRACKING (76%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (75%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (74%); UNITED NATIONS (74%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (74%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (70%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (69%); ECONOMIC POLICY (65%); DEATH & DYING (60%); South Africa (%); Coronavirus (%); International Organizations and Africa (%); Europe and Africa (%)

2020-10-02,"North to South, Countries Must Collaborate to End Covid-19 [opinion]",,"If there will ever be a time to dig deep into our core as Salesmen to sell, then it is now. And If there will ever be a time to handle great objections to sell, it is now. Lastly, if there will ever be a period of time to experience rejections and delays in closing, it is now.
2020 is certainly a turning point in modern human history. The impact of the pandemic is having a ravaging effect on businesses across the world.
Here are some suggestions that you can apply as you sell during the pandemic.
You are on the frontlines.
Sales professionals have always been onthe frontlines. Do not be afraid toapproach prospects and clients to offer solutions. There are many people, and organizations out there thatneed solutions to their problems. Step out there and offer that solution. Front liners are brave despite the obvious odds.
Use the soft approach
With the avalanche of information at the disposal of the client, the days of pushy sales are long gone. This is not the time to do pressure selling - it has never worked and will never work. You must be a sympathetic and empathetic sales professional. Some of the accounts and pay points are dealing with dwindling revenues and escalating overheads. Don't add to their headaches. When you get in touch ask about the welfare of their businesses and their families. When the situation improves, you will be rewarded.
Do not be a lamenting Sales professional.
Ask the average sales person why he missed his imperatives. He will blame everything except himself. The economy, exchange rate, the competition is offering something better, the weather, inflation, poor customer service, no selling literature, our prices are in the roof, commissions are low, no training, management bureaucracies, etcetera etcetera.
And now we have the novel and mother of all excuses - C19.Do not try to write another version of the book of Lamentation of the Bible. Instead explore ways you can become better. Sales is scientific, with no short cuts. The only way to stop lamenting is to follow the rudiments of sales.
Be positive minded
I dare say that our minds are under siege. We have been arrested by the barrage of negative information propagated by mainstream and social media. It is as if there is a trophy to be won for the media house that will be first to break C19 story. Social media is the worst culprit, where a lot of fake news is being circulated creating fear and panic. The effect of all this on the sales professional can be damaging. We have to be mentally strong to handle objections and deal with sales related issues. We cannot allow our minds to be damping sites.
Denis Waitley in his book - Safari to the Soul talks about the placebo effect. Volunteers are treated with experimental drugs whose effect is tested by measuring the difference in response to the powerless placebo and to the drug. Some group of volunteers who had just had their wisdom teeth extracted were given morphine to alleviate their pain, the others swallowed a placebo they believed to be a powerful pain killer. Many of the placebo recipients said they experienced dramatic relief from their pain, believing they had been given morphine too. However, when a drug that blocks the effects of the natural endorphin was given to them, the pain returned almost immediately. That test, and many others, have confirmed something very important: When a patient believes he has been given a pain reliever, the brain releases chemicals to substantiate their belief. In short, the placebo effect is an act of faith.
Feed your mind with positive things. Read the books that will make you strong. Listen to country or jazz music to calm you down. Everything starts from the mind, and so be positive.
Maybe we are in for the long haul, this is the time that all frontline sales professionals must rise up to deliver.
Go make it happen.

2020-05-27,How to Sell During COVID-19 [opinion],,"The Armed Forces of the Philippines (AFP) is now looking to transport more coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) vaccines outside the National Capital Region (NCR) using its various land, air, and naval transport assets.
AFP chief-of-staff Lt. Gen. Cirilito Sobejana, in a statement Friday, said this is now being coordinated with the Department of Health (DOH) as regards to the protocol on handling and storage of the vaccines.
We are one with the government and the Health Department in the full force implementation of the National Vaccine Deployment Program. I am urging all members of the Armed Forces of the Philippines to join this effort so that we will be able to convey to our people the need for their cooperation in the fight against the Covid-19 pandemic, he added.
On Friday, a Philippine Air Force C-295 medium transport aircraft transported 600 vials of Covid-19 vaccines from Villamor Airbase, Pasay City to the Lumbia Airfield in Cagayan de Oro City.
It was then escorted by military and medical personnel to its destination at the 4th Infantry Division at its headquarters in Camp Evangelista. The vials were the first batch of vaccines that were delivered by the military outside the NCR.

2021-03-08,Philippines : AFP readies more transport ops for Covid-19 jabs,,"While the effects of the coronavirus continue to ricochet across the globe, some parts of the world are just beginning to see the economic effects of the virus. For those of us with an interest in China's sustainability ambitions, one important question to ponder is how the health crisis could potentially impact those ambitions.
The direct short-term environmental impact of China's production engine being slowed to a halt looks likely to mean that China's demand for natural resources in 2020 as well as its emissions will be lower than in most years prior.
As China gradually gets back to business throughout March and April, fears are that this respite will be short-lived and then offset by the economic stimulus designed to achieve a rapid economic recovery. An easing of requirements for environmental protection will likely happen in the short run to reduce red tape. This will allow for an acceleration of the construction of infrastructure, including roads, rail and real estate. At the same time, the stimulus will possibly also boost further progress in green and digital technologies in China.
If the virus has had any positive effects, it has certainly increased awareness of the imbalance between the human and natural ecosystems. One thing is for certain - awareness and behavioral change are crucial if China is to lead the sustainability trend.
One crucial realization, which is fortunately clear to most Chinese people, is that the illegal wild animal trade and society's increasing invasion of wildlife habitats are signals of an unsustainable imbalance between the human world and animal ecosystems. Tackling climate change and striving for a sustainable balance between the natural ecosystem and human activity are critical to preventing future virus outbreaks.
Most indications point to the virus having first appeared at a wildlife market - a fact that should cause us to demand the regulation of (parts of) these activities. China has the world's largest wildlife markets and the coronavirus pandemic provides a significant opportunity to stem and regulate wildlife consumption.
China's top legislature - the National People's Congress - decided on Feb. 24 to eliminate the bad habit of eating wild animals and crack down on the illegal wildlife trade to better protect people's health.
While it is an overdue move, it remains to be seen whether the scope of the law will be as impactful as hoped for. Several kinds of animals are not covered (e.g. aquatic animals) and there is a lack of clarity about how it will be applied to the consumption of wildlife for traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) or for ""scientific purposes.""
Furthermore, the coronavirus crisis has slowed progress toward meeting two of the biggest promises of the Communist Party of China - a doubling of GDP and GDP per capita compared with the year 2010, and the total eradication of poverty.
Accordingly, stimulus is likely to be directed to infrastructure and real estate development, which are expected to result in employment, allowing the government to raise much-needed funds while increasing homeowners' wealth. However, such stimulus will likely also have a negative sustainability impact resulting from materiality risks associated with the outsized role of steel and cement production.
Chinese inventiveness has been omnipresent over the last two months: from companies changing their business models overnight, remote working and learning, to a boom for Chinese medtech and health care platforms.
It will be interesting to observe the possible upcoming global growth of companies in the business of monitoring and tracking environmental data such as water quality, air pollution and now also online platforms tracking people's movement.
The spread of the coronavirus shows the global mutual dependency we are all facing. In the struggle for developing a society that is robust in the era of climate - and nature - crisis, the coronavirus outbreak couldn't have made it clearer that we will pay the highest of prices if we insist on a nation-centric vision in the wake of ecological challenges. In the absence of global leadership, this might still be a moment when China rises to the challenge.

2020-03-20,Opinion: Covid-19 Challenges China's Sustainable Development Agenda,,"Rarely in the world have women's and girls' rights been challenged as they have been in Afghanistan. The latest developments give cause for great concern. The European Union has made it clear that future EU development assistance to Afghanistan will depend on the respect for the international legal framework and for norms on human rights, including women's and girls' rights. The EU is determined and committed to continue to support the women and girls of Afghanistan and worldwide, sticking to our values and beliefs.
Together with human rights, freedom and democracy, equality represents one of the core values that make the EU what it is. It enriches our societies and strengthens their resilience. Gender equality is a core part of peace, security, economic prosperity and sustainable development. Moreover, defending and promoting gender equality is required by the EU treaties.
That is why working politically, operationally and financially to promote and safeguard progress on gender equality is a political priority and a key objective for the EU. The EU Gender Action Plan III and the new EU external action budget provide a road map for global action towards a gender-equal world. We work closely together with multilateral, regional and bilateral partners, including civil society organizations, to achieve those objectives. We still have a long way to go; there is no room for complacency. However, we are stronger together while many challenges remain.

In many countries, the COVID-19 crisis has exacerbated existing gender inequalities across different areas: education, vocational training, health, security and safety, sexual and reproductive health and rights, decision-making and economic opportunities.
The COVID-19 lockdowns have often seen an increase in gender-based violence, in particular domestic violence, while women and girls' access to sexual and reproductive health services has been reduced. At the same time, a significant part of the care burden has fallen on women and girls. Workers in the informal economy and in low-skilled jobs (most of whom are women), migrants, and those belonging to minorities, have been more at risk and face multiple and intersecting forms of discrimination.
Moreover, school closures have exposed girls to an increased risk of sexual exploitation, early pregnancy, child labor, and forced marriage. The Malala Fund estimates that 20 million more girls risk dropping out of school, adding up to a total of 150 million girls – equivalent to a third of the EU population – without educational prospects.Israelis demonstrate against gendered violence at Habima Square in Tel Aviv. (credit: AVSHALOM SASSONI/MAARIV)
According to a recent United Nations report, military spending in 2020 still outplaced the worldwide expenses on health, even in a year that was dominated by the corona pandemic. For a sustainable recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, we need to redouble our efforts to promote gender equality.
Now is the time to do more.
 This challenge requires a global response and needs to be tackled now, when we are building the future we wish for our children and grandchildren to grow up in a post-pandemic world that is more equal, more diverse, and where equal opportunities are a reality. We need to address the root causes of gender inequality and gender-based discrimination in order to achieve sustainable change.
The EU and its member states, as well as the European financial institutions, have stood with the women and girls of the world throughout the pandemic. As Team Europe, we have already mobilized €46 billion in support of over 130 partner countries, with a particular focus on women and youth.
Three examples as an illustration: In Nepal, we helped one million girls and boys continue their education through radio-based learning. In Togo, we supported the creation of a universal income scheme and the appointment of women to head new municipalities. Worldwide, the EU-UN Spotlight Initiative has helped 650,000 women and girls prevent or address violence against them, and educated 880,000 men and boys on positive masculinity, non-violent conflict resolution and parenting.
Still, to meet the growing challenges, we need to do more and better. That is the purpose of the Gender Action Plan III. It promotes leadership and meaningful participation of women, girls and young people in political, economic, social and cultural life, as well as in all matters related to peace and security, worldwide.
We work to get human development back on track.
We are now making this plan a reality with the help of the new €79.5b. 
NDICI-Global Europe instrument that will support the EU's external action for the next seven years.
 Support for education and particularly girls' education will have a central role. Just as we support education in emergencies, the EU has worked with partner countries throughout the pandemic to minimize its impact on learning and the well-being of children, and to facilitate a safe return to school.
We already provide more than half of all global aid to education as Team Europe. But we will increase funding further, to promote gender equality through quality education at all levels. Our joint €1.7b. pledge to the Global Partnership for Education in July – to transform education for girls and boys in up to 90 countries and territories – is part of this new beginning.
We are multiplying our efforts across the board, from supporting women's and girls' education and economic opportunities to improving their access to sexual and reproductive health services. By 2025, 85% of all the EU's new external actions – across all sectors – will contribute to gender equality and women's empowerment.
This is now being finalized with our partner countries based on close consultation with civil society organizations, women's rights activists and youth.
We need to put human development back on track and achieve the Sustainable Development Goals by 2030, leaving no woman or girl behind.
It is crucial we get it right.

2021-11-24,Gender equality crucial for recovery from COVID-19 - opinion,,"For those who live in slums and informal settlements, the Covid-19 pandemic has brought to the forefront their greatest vulnerabilities. But they are fighting back; organising, and coming up with creative ways to protect their communities.
Regular handwashing with soap and water is a first line of defence in protecting from deadly diseases, but in sub-Saharan Africa, 63 per cent of people in urban areas - that's 258 million people - lack access to decent handwashing facilities.
Globally, there are 3 billion people who do not have access to soap and water to wash their hands at home.
Other preventative measures employed by governments such as lockdowns and curfews are equally implausible for those living in slums and informal settlements.
It's often so crowded that there is often no space for physical distancing, especially for those who need to leave their homes to collect water or use communal toilets.
When businesses are informal and your economy functions on a day-to-day basis, advice to work from home, or close your business is unworkable. In many places informal markets have been cleared and people evicted in response to COVID-19, ignoring the rights of the urban poor and the role they play in the rest of the city.
Despite all these barriers, those living in informal settlements are organising to fight back against COVID-19.
Some of the most inspiring responses to the pandemic we are seeing have been led by residents of informal settlements. They are installing handwashing stations, producing maps and situation reports, and even highlighting isolation areas.
We must learn from, and scale up, these community-led activities, and empower people to protect themselves.
At WaterAid, supported by partners such as H&M Foundation, we have been working with groups within informal settlement in their work to bring handwashing facilities, clean water and decent toilets to everyone in their community.
In Kamwokya II, in Kampala, Uganda's capital city, which is home to more than 6,000 people in less than half a square kilometre of land, Christopher Tumwine leads a community action group called 'Weyonje' (clean yourself'), supported by WaterAid and the Kampala Capital City Authority.
For Chris, clean water, good hygiene and decent toilets are always front of mind. Weyonje goes house to house talking to people about how to use toilets properly and dispose of the waste safely.
Worried that advice and programmes aimed to protect the population against COVID-19 are leaving informal settlements behind, they are now also teaching people about the importance of hygiene and handwashing.
To create long term change, Chris needs the support of government, business and his neighbours, and in recent years, he has spent his time campaigning for a sustainable solution to protect his community's health, safety and dignity from overflowing sewers, filthy water and disease.
Chris said: ""Our settlement is densely populated, and houses are near each other. Social distancing is a myth in the slums, it is something designed for people living in affluent places of the city. We have shared toilets, bathrooms and public water taps, and our children always get out of the houses to play with other kids in the neighbourhood. We are just lucky that Coronavirus has not reached the slum.""
Chris believes community groups like Weyonje are crucial to stopping the spread of diseases such as COVID-19 in the area:
""In Kamwokya, we have created a Weyonje WhatsApp group during the lockdown where group members share information on how best we can help the community. This is a good platform that we can use to counter misinformation about COVID-19 that is circulating on social media. Using megaphones, we carry out house to house community education; teaching the community residents that proper and regular handwashing with water and soap is a defence against the spread of coronavirus.""
As many in the community don't have a water source close to home, they create makeshift handwashing stations, filling a plastic bottle with soap and water and tying it to their front door with string, so they can wash their hands before entering their homes.
Across the world there are groups and organisations just like Weyonje, working tirelessly to protect their communities from the spread of illness and convince the public and government alike that clean water and decent toilets must be a priority.
In Kenya, for example, Muungano wa Wanavijiji - which means 'united slum dwellers' - are using their knowledge of the country's informal settlement to help track cases of COVID-19 and communicate government messages about preventing the spread of the disease to those who are the most vulnerable.
In 2019, and before the Covid-19 pandemic started, WaterAid followed Weyonje and its leader Chris to film their work and witness an exciting moment for Kamwokya. Watch the film, supported by H&M Foundation, to see what the team achieved here.
*WaterAid and H&M Foundation are working with communities, governments and partners, to create long lasting change, and bring clean water, decent toilets and good hygiene to communities around the world.

2020-10-14,The Urban Poor Are Fighting Back Against Covid-19 [opinion],,"Americans are divided over the distribution and severity of the Covid-19 virus. A wide swath of Americans view the virus as a variant of flu with its dire effects greatly overstated. On the other hand, mainstream public health officials and establishment media emphasize the dangers and risks of the virus and its threat to health and well-being. What is the reality?
The US Experience
A problem in sorting out the reality is sudden and devastating waves of infection that afflicted Italy, Spain, France, the UK, and the Northeastern US. Covid-19 was easily transmissible and quickly afflicted large numbers of people. Hospitals were overwhelmed. Elderly individuals were the bulk of patients, but also affected were younger and middle-aged persons with pre-existing health issues.
Americans were facing this crisis with little sense of what awaited and little control over the outcome. In an environment of unknowing, theories abound. Early estimates of the lethality of Covid-19 Case Fatality Rate (CFR) based on hospital records and afflicted cohorts varied from 2 percent to 6 percent. For many especially the elderly and persons with preexisting health conditions, Covid-19 seemed like a death sentence.
In the US, testing and contact tracing to limit the spread of the disease that had been implemented with great success in China, Hong Kong, Singapore, New Zealand, Australia, Finland, and other European countries lagged. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) seemed ill-prepared. The administration largely ignored the early stages of the infection as it took root in the US.
Viral Reproduction (R0), Case Fatality Rate (CFR), Infection Fatality Rate (IFR)
To appreciate the arguments put forward by different sides in this debate, some definitions are important. R0or R zero is the basic reproduction rate that conveys the expected number of cases generated by one person among susceptible individuals. R0less than 1 means a diminishing number of persons infected, and R0greater than 1 means an increasing number. Case Fatality Rate (CFR) is the proportion of deaths from a disease in relation to the total number of peoplediagnosedwith the disease. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) represents the proportion of deaths in relation to the total number of peopleinfectedby the disease. The CFR is based upon diagnosed cases solely while the IFR includes diagnosed, undiagnosed, and asymptomatic infections.
Infection Fatality Rate
Early in the pandemic, estimates of death following infection varied between 2.4 to 5.4 per hundred, mirroring the Case Fatality Rate (CFR). Gradually, studies began to appear in districts and cantons of Italy and Switzerland that suggested up to 10 times the number of persons than had been hospitalized had serological evidence of previous infection and experienced no symptoms. In the same vein, about half the infected passengers quarantined on the Princess Cruise Ship were symptom free. As more people were identified with the virus, epidemiologists began to ratchet down the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) of Covid-19. Following inclusion of undetected cases,the IFR is now generally agreedto range from 0.06 to 0.10 per hundred across age groups. The revised estimates are still grim and compare with the average seasonal flu IFR that hovers around .01. The Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) suggests that Covid-19 is 6 to 10 times more deadly than the flu.
US 2020 Influenza Deaths
Figure 1: Cumulative US Influenza Deaths by Age Group. Data compiled from the CDC database.
The total number of influenza cases from January 1stto July 22, 2020 is 6,553. The median value for influenza deaths per year during the past five years is 38,230. The current value is well below expectations, perhaps due in part, to following public health guidelines that limit aerosol and droplet transmission, and to vulnerable individuals succumbing to the more infectious Covid-19. Influenza's Reproduction Rate (R0) is calculated between 0.9 and 2.1 in contrast to Covid-19's with values between 2.2 and 2.7. Like Covid-19, however, influenza more grievously afflicts persons with pre-existing conditions, the middle aged, and the elderly.
US 2020 Covid-19 Deaths
Figure 2: Cumulative US Covid-19 Deaths by Age Group. Data compiled from the CDC database.
The total number of US deaths attributed to Covid-19 through July 22, 2020 was 143, 868. The CDC updated the number one week later on July 28, 2020 to 147,672. Covid-19 deaths gradually ramp up beginning in the 20-year-old group then rise exponentially starting in the 45 to 54-year-old group. The rise continues into old age even as populations in later cohorts' decline.
The reasons for the observed Covid-19 distribution of deaths by age profile are various. As persons age, immune response declines. The number and severity of chronic disease increase. Older persons are increasingly likely to be in retirement homes or managed care facilities which have become Covid-19 ""hotspots"", and potent vectors for disease transmission.
Preexisting Health Conditions and Covid-19 Deaths
Figure 3: Percent Distribution of Health Conditions Associated with Covid-19 Deaths Note: The data is based upon 8,060 death certificates filed by US states with the CDC. The distribution of major categories of pre-existing conditions associated with Covid-19 deaths is complete through July 22, 2020. The report reflects a fraction of deaths due to differences in filing time and compliance. The CDC offers more refined data about causes of death, including ICD diagnoses, through a spreadsheet available at its website.
In order of severity, the major categories of preexisting health conditions related to Covid-19 deaths identified by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention are Alzheimer's Disease (2.55%), obesity (3.11%), intentional and unintentional injury (3.09%), malignant neoplasms (3.57%), vascular and unspecified dementia (3.7%), renal failure (4.48%), sepsis (4.55%), diabetes (5.13%), other causes (7.2%), corona virus disease (7.66%), respiratory diseases (27.3%), and circulatory diseases (27.67%). Clearly, circulatory, and respiratory disorders are in the foreground followed by diabetes and associated complications. The presence of Alzheimer's and dementias reflect the high incidence of deaths among older persons in assisted living facilities. But any condition that compromises immune function increases the likelihood of death.
Racial and Ethnic Covid-19 Disparities
Black and Hispanic Americans are more likely to beinfected by Covid-19, hospitalized, and die than white Americans. Depending upon locality, Black and Hispanic Americans are twice to three times more at risk. Members of these groups are more exposed to infection by virtue of living arrangements, occupation, and forms of social interaction. Exposure is often compounded by pre-existing health conditions, such as diabetes, obesity, and emphysema. Health care for chronic conditions may be marginal or unavailable due to absence of local facilities, poverty, or immigration status.
Estimated Number of Asymptomatic (Subclinical) Covid-19 Infections
Since the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) from Covid-19 now includes asymptomatic individuals, and spans the young and the old, the number of persons who have been infected may be calculated from the number of deaths. The CDC lists the current total number of deaths from the virus in the US on July 22, 2020 as 143, 868 persons. If the IFR equals 0.06, only 6 percent of all infected persons are represented. Adding the additional 94 percent yields a total of 13,667,460 persons or 4.1 percent of the US population. If the IFR equals 0.10, adding the additional 90 percent yields a total of 13,091, 978 persons or 3.9 percent of the US population. This contrasts with the CDC infection count of 4,024,492 or 1.2 percent of the US population. The estimate of infected persons is roughly 3.25 times larger than the confirmed infection count.
At the time of this writing, excess deaths fromall-cause mortality during the period of the Covid-19 pandemicis 28 percent higher than that attributed to Covid-19 on death certificates. If this 28 percent increment is added to the official count of Covid-19 deaths when the IFR equals 0.6%, the total number of infected persons rises to 17,309,934 persons or 5.1 percent of the US population, and when the IFR is 1% , the total number rises to 16,757,468 or 5.0 percent of the US population.
Evidence for Both Sides of the Debate
Therefore, evidence supports both sides of the Covid-19 debate: Is Covid-19 as dangerous as authorities make it to be? On the one hand, many more persons are infected and likely asymptomatic than persons with symptoms, and those who are under 35 years of age, unless compromised by preexisting conditions, run a marginal risk of illness. On the other hand, Covid-19 is highly infectious, including those who are asymptomatic, 6 to 10 times more lethal than the flu, increasingly dangerous with age, and often deadly when coupled with preexisting conditions.
The back estimation of Covid-19 infections in the US makes clear that the virus has a long way to run with a potential fatality limit from 1,986.000 for 0.06 per hundred death rate to 3,310, 000 persons for a 0.10 per hundred death rate. Neither fatality limit is likely to be realized. Americans are widely dispersed. Increasing numbers practice social distancing, appropriate hygiene, avoid crowds and public transportation. Improved medical treatments and a potential vaccination are likely to further reduce the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR).
Long-Term Consequence of Covid-19 Infection
The lingering effects of Covid19 are largely unknown. Research with Sars1, a relative to Covid-19, aka Sars2, presents a bleak picture. Pulmonary problems, shortness of breath, and chronic fatigue characterized the aftermath of Sars1 infections for survivors. Survivors were relatively young at the time of infection, typically in their 20s or early 30s. Persons older at the time of Sars1 infection were less likely to survive at all.
Anecdotal evidence about the lingering effects of Covid-19 Is comprised of narratives from Covid-19 survivors about the aftermath of the virus. Like Sars1, shortness of breath, pulmonary issues, memory issues, and chronic fatigue are common themes. Clinical observation suggests the severity of aftermath is associated with the symptom pattern and duration of the infection.The COVID Symptom Studyrevealed six separate clusters of COVID-19 symptoms:
('flu-like' with no fever): Headache, loss of smell, muscle pains, cough, sore throat, chest pain, no fever.('flu-like' with fever): Headache, loss of smell, cough, sore throat, hoarseness, fever, loss of appetite.(gastrointestinal): Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, diarrhea, sore throat, chest pain, no cough.(severe level one, fatigue): Headache, loss of smell, cough, fever, hoarseness, chest pain, fatigue.(severe level two, confusion): Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, cough, fever, hoarseness, sore throat, chest pain, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain.(severe level three, abdominal and respiratory): Headache, loss of smell, loss of appetite, cough, fever, hoarseness, sore throat, chest pain, fatigue, confusion, muscle pain, shortness of breath, diarrhea, abdominal pain.
Current research and clinical observation support the association between severity, from 1 to 6, and lingering effects. Some effects appear not readily reversible. However, a cautionary study by German investigators titled ""Outcomes of Cardiovascular Magnetic Resonance Imaging in Patients Recently Recovered From Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"" published the July issue ofJama Cardiologycalls into question the clinical observation of association between severity and long-term effects. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans of 100 persons who recovered from Covid-19 at home or at a hospital showed 78% with cardiac involvement and 60% with myocardial inflammation. No relation existed between symptom severity and preexisting conditions and the overall course of the acute illness or the time from the original diagnosis. These cautionary findings have relevance as well to persons who were positive for Covid-19 and asymptomatic
Lingering Effects of Asymptomatic Infection
Forty to eighty percent of the population infected by Covid-19 may be asymptomatic. If the median back estimate of 4.5 percent of the US population is correct, and half are asymptomatic, the number is 7,447,500 asymptomatic persons. Many of this group are likely under 35 years of age and free from conditions that contribute to the severity of the disease. For this age group, long-term effects are likely to be muted. But as age and contributing conditions ratchet up, the likelihood of damage, even for infected persons without symptoms, increases. The 20 to 60 percent of persons who display symptoms and as many as half without symptoms are likely to experience a decreased quality of life. This is due tostealth damageto the lungs, circulatory system, kidneys, brain, and other organs.
The literature concerning asymptomatic Covid-19 infection is limited.In a paper published in March, 2020 in the journal Radiology titled ""Chest CT Findings in Cases from the Cruise Ship ""Diamond Princess"" with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19)"", Shohei Inui et al evaluated computed tomography (CT) scans of lung and bronchial passages of 104 persons who were quarantined on the Diamond Princess Cruise Ship. A total of 104 cases were examined, 76 of whom were asymptomatic and 28 symptomatic. The authors concluded,
""Although lung parenchymal and airway abnormalities were more frequent in symptomatically than asymptomatic cases, noticeably, we found lung parenchymal changes on CT in up to 54% of the asymptomatic cases. In those who showed CT abnormalities, asymptomatic cases showed significantly (sic) predominance of GGO, while consolidation was predominant in symptomatic cases.""
Glass Opacity (GGO) describes the tissue damage in the lungs of asymptomatic volunteers. GGO is used in chest radiography to refer to a region of hazy lung radiopacity, often diffuse, in which the edges of the pulmonary vessels may be difficult to distinguish. GGO is indicative of infection, chronic interstitial disease, acute alveolar disease, and other chronic and acute syndromes.
At the same time, the results of the paper support the view that lung damage is linked to the severity of symptoms during infection with half (54%) of asymptomatic patients having lung damage. The more severe the symptoms, the more severe the aftermath, but absence of symptoms did not mean absence of aftermath. The disease may be subclinical, but consequences are observed that likely impact the future quality of life.
Confused Public Policy
Among developed nations, the US has fallen far behind in control of the virus. US prestige and soft power has been eroded. A country that cannot manage itself cannot claim to manage or lecture other countries on how to manage themselves.
A window into ""behind the scenes"" influence that may have contributed to the US stumbling response to the Covid-19 virus were early prognostications by a group of epidemiologists, savey academics, and thought leaders. John Ioannidis, a Stanford professor, appeared to play a pivotal role in demoting the threat level of Covid-19 to little more than the seasonal flu.An early study (March, 2020) of Covid-19 seroprevalenceled by his team concluded the Infection Fatality Rate (IFR) at 0.012 to 0.02 and later revised to 0.017. The study, a focus of Op Ed columns in the Wall Street Journal and the New York Times provoked controversy among specialists due to its design and possibility of false positives that would reduce estimated IFR. More recently, Ioannidis has provided anupdateto his earlier estimation based upon a review of published seroprevalence data. He concluded that the overall Covid-19 IFR is 0.027, a relatively small shift from his initial estimate. However, the estimated IFR varies depending upon the ratio of deaths to population, Ioannidis writes,
""Median corrected IFR was 0.10% in locations with COVID-19 population mortality rate less than the global average (<73 deaths per million as of July 12, 2020), 0.27% in locations with 73-500 COVID-19 deaths per million, and 0.90% in locations exceeding 500 COVID-19 deaths per million.""
In other words, the higher the death rate, the higher the IFR. By the end of August, US deaths from Covid-19 deaths are likely to equal or exceed 500 per million. Many metropolitan areas already meet this criterion. The US IFR at 0.90% is 4 1/2 to 7 1/2 times Ioannidis et al's earlier estimation of 0.12% to 0.2%
Where to from Here?
As the quality of life decreases, so does economic productivity. Dependency and the demand for services increase. The cost of Covid-19 has yet to be calculated and perhaps will never be known. Presently, the US preoccupation is the current costs of support for individuals, families, and businesses deprived of income. But cost is long-term. In an economy that expects 2-3% growth as a norm, the weight of Covid-19 costs is likely to continue and weigh upon productivity from Covid-19's sequelae.
Lessons learned from the Covid-19 debacle are sobering and suggest different priorities in the national debate about the future course of government policy. The first lesson is lack of foresight and preparation is costly. Money does not substitute for intelligence. Contingency planning is essential. Government must reexamine its priorities. The physical health of its citizenry undergirds social and economic well-being. Public Health needs to be revamped. The second lesson is the economic interdependence of Americans. The country cannot be shut down without profound effects on individuals, families, and businesses. Throwing older citizens and minorities under the bus by opening the country undermines the common ground of government as described in the Declaration of Independence ""the protection of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness"" for all its citizens.

The survey poll aims to measure public awareness on Covid-19 vaccine, as well as the attitudes and practices related to the vaccine.
The poll also aims to identify the surveyed individual's view on the safety of the vaccine, their belief on its capability to prevent them from the infection, their opinion on whether it is necessary to take the vaccine for those with a history of infection, the side effects of the vaccine, and number of doses needed.
The surveyed people will be also asked about their anxiety regarding the vaccine, reasons behind the anxiety if found, and the reason for rejecting the vaccine, if any.
The survey will also seek to identify the extent of public awareness on the pandemic, its symptoms, modes of transmission, proper treatment when infected and the most vulnerable people infected, in addition to identifying the sources of his/her knowledge about the vaccine.

2020-12-23,NCSI Carries out Opinion Poll on Covid-19 Vaccine,,"May 14, 2020( City Limits: http://www.citylimits.org Delivered by Newstex) ;;; Murphy Compared to New York City's 2.15 percent rate of infection, on Rikers the rate stands at 9.53 percent (95 infections per 1000 people). Over the course of this pandemic, we have been repeatedly confronted with the callousness of our elected leaders. Whether it was the image of Governor Andrew Cuomo unveiling a bizarre 'art' project wall of PPE masks[1] that (most likely) had been sent with the intention of being given to frontline workers, or Mayor Bill de Blasio's recent proto-authoritarian protest ban in NYC, or Chief Judge Janet Difiore's unwavering lack of empathy for people jailed in the city — it's clear that those who run NYC do so in cold blood. They scapegoat each other and point fingers, while the media blithely complies and celebrates them for proving 'to be the leader [the] nation needs.'[2] And all this, while standing behind their superficial and false 'commitments' to challenging racial inequities[3] during COVID-19[4] as communities of color bear the brunt of this pandemicWhy should we praise politicians who have left thousands of Black and Latino New Yorkers to die? Governor Cuomo, Mayor De Blasio, NYC Chief Judge Janet Difiore, District Attorneys Gonzalez, Katz, Vance, Clark, McMahon, DOC Commissioner Cynthia Brann and NYPD Commissioner Dermot Shea make up a complicated matrix of politicos who have the power to stop thousands of preventable deaths. 
In reality, the stories our elected officials tell to the media would be laughable if they weren't so deadly. New York City's rates of infection have far surpassed the rest of the country, and even as the rate slows here, many deaths — for example, in the Bangladeshi community — remain uncounted.Of the 20K+ deaths in NYC, the majority of them have been Black, Latino, Asian, concentrated in the Bronx &#38; Queens[5]. People of color, particularly undocumented immigrants, have either comprised the majority of essential workers or been left unemployed without federal economic relief. Between the dates of April 24 and May 1, NYPD arrested 200 people to send them to die in a pandemic, even though jails like Rikers and the Metropolitan Detention Center are some of the leading sources of infections, along with nursing homes.Compared to New York City's 2.15 percent rate of infection, however, in Rikers the rate remains at 9.53 percent (95 infections per 1000 people). This rate of infection is the highest it has ever been in Rikers, due to miserable conditions inside, and lowering of even the most minimum standards of healthcare[6]. Those who are sick receive abysmal care, and those who aren't — well, it's only a matter of time. Just last week, frontline nurses working at Rikers led a protest to demand [7]more soap and running water to treat people inside the jail. Earlier, two dorms of 45 people inside Rikers led a labor strike to demand PPE and cleaning supplies, targeting DOC Commissioner Cynthia Brann, to no avail. This isn't to say the city's released no one — as of April 30, the decline in jail population was around 900 since Jan 1.[8] In their reporting, however, they take credit for the work that's been done by bail funds to get over 200 people out on bail. But that's less than half of its total incarcerated population, with more than 2000 people still held on pre-trial (unconvicted) charges, and criminalization back on the rise. All this, despite report after report evidencing that mass releases will significantly reduce[9] the spread of COVID-19 both inside and outside jails.Brand new reporting data from the Board of Corrections also shows that that over 75 percent of people testing positive for COVID-19 in the jails are Black and Latino. Similarly, 67 percent of all deaths accounted for in New York City are of Black, Latino, or Asian people. [10]Even inside nursing homes across the city, the majority of deaths have been of residents of color, with rates ranging from 46 percent in Queens to 88 percent in the Bronx, according to data collected by NPR.[11] This is what continued racial apartheid looks like. And the names above — they're all responsible. CityViews[12] are readers' opinions, not those of City Limits. Add your voice today![13] And then there's the police. ‪In the last week, we learned that of 40 arrested on racist 'social distancing violations,' 35 were Black and 4 were Latino. We also learned that 81 percent of social distancing summonses were for Black or Latino people. ‬Viral videos of typical police brutality from NYPD went viral, as the city unleashed 1,000 police on subways[14] to throw people out. Instead of opening vacant housing or cancelling rent, the subways have been shut down at night and houseless people are literally being thrown into the street.On April 16, Mayor de Blasio released his war-driven austerity budget[15], whichincludes more than $800 million in cuts to education alone, and the total elimination of the city's summer youth employment program. Despite these draconian cuts and unprecedented revenue shortfalls, two city departments came out of the revised budget process not only unscathed, but with a budget increase[16] and guaranteed capital-growth[17]: the NYPD and the Department of Corrections (DOC). As others have written, we can't police ourselves out of a pandemic.For unconvinced readers, allow me to spell it out. COVID-19 is spreading through prisons and jails due to terrible — albeit standard — conditions inside, meaning that it will continue to contribute to rising infections throughout the city — for this, DOC Commissioner Cynthia Brann is at fault. Thanks to NYPD Commissioner Shea and the District Attorneys, thousands of people held pre-trial will be exposed to a deadly disease and increased criminalization will lead to new people in jail. Thanks to the New York City Council and its mayor, precious public funding will go to four new central borough-based jails (and up to 12 other satellite caging facilities). With cuts to programs like the Summer Youth Employment Program that thousands of young people of color rely on, it will most likely be the Black and Latino youth that police decide to surveil for social distancing this summer. When they arrest people, it'll be Black or Latino New Yorkers. When the majority of people die, it'll be in jail, nursing homes, or in the Bronx, and it'll most likely be Black or Latino or Asian New Yorkers. The best this city's leaders have to offer is a 'Taskforce on Racial Inclusion and Equity'[18] that has no current plans to respond to the crisis inside jails. When instead they could choose to free them all for public health, close Rikers Island, stop building jails, and invest in care infrastructure.Against the backdrop of Cuomo's budget cuts, and the ones being considered by the City Council this week, NYC's COVID-19 story is one of austerity. To distract from their own dismal mismanagement, Cuomo and de Blasio have instead relied on nonprofits and private sector investors like the Gates Foundation to 'reimagine' education rather than fund the schools we already have, while Cuomo uses his moment of political goodwill to cut Medicaid. Not only is this moment unexceptional, but the city's deployment of a COVID-19 shock doctrine is possible only because of the deep existing racial and economic fissures within New York City. By slashing budgets for education and housing, but by driving billons towards new jails and police, not just now but for years, the city's leaders have enabled and supported a continued racial apartheid in America.We have seen this strategy in New York before, and we know the results. The 1970s and 1980s policy approach of planned shrinkage and benign neglect[19] divested in the South Bronx and other Black and Latino neighborhoods while heavily policing and criminalizing these same communities for emerging public health concerns, substance use and HIV/AIDS. That toxic mix of racist policing and racist public policy led to an extraordinary rate of preventable deaths, as neoliberal politicos sought to 'clean up' the city and balance the budget. As history seeks to repeat itself, we refuse to adhere to this violent logic and let a balanced budget come at the cost of our lives.As the first bout of social distancing wanes, and we inch closer to a vaccine, New York City's political echelons will rally behind each other while gaslighting the public into believing that this crisis was handled well. They'll pat each other on the back and say the lives lost were collateral damage, while lowering the city flag to half mast for fallen police on stolen land. We'll never learn the names of people found dead in the subway or in their Rikers cell, preventable casualties of public austerity and incalculable racism. But as people who love and live in this city, we should recognize their shock doctrine at play. Even as the public learns what we've always known; that courts can be closed and evictions cancelled; police presence lowered and people released; people housed in hotels and hospitals built overnight, these plutocrats will have sold the city out and called it 'equity.'Mon Mohapatra and Marlene Nava Ramos are organizers with the Free Them All for Public Health campaign in New York City.

2020-05-14,Opinion: COVID-19 and NYC's Heart of Darkness,,"Iranian Foreign Ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said on Friday that the US has no resolve to help Iran fight COVID-19 epidemic and US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's is misleading world public opinion, Eurasia Diary reports citing IRNA.  The US claim of helping Iran to fight the deadly epidemic is psychological warfare when the US has put massive pressure on the Iranian people through its maximum pressure and blocked even entry of medicine and medical equipment, he said.
  Islamic Republic of Iran has been in close contact with many countries to meet pharmaceutical and sanitary needs and combat the epidemic, Mousavi said, adding that 100,000 testing kits, surgery masks, artificial breathing apparatus have so far been provided by friendly countries and other aid shipment are on way to Iran.   Countering coronavirus which has turned into a global epidemic requires global resolve and cooperation, not hypocritical moves made with political purposes and abusing sufferings of the people, Mousavi said.
  Pompeo wrote in a tweet late on Friday that he is deeply concerned about spread of coronavirus in Iran and threat against public health in the country and its neighbors.  Coronavirus cases in Iran surged to 388 on Friday and eight more people died, bringing the number of deaths to 34, the highest outside of China, Iran's Health Ministry said.
  In the past 24 hours, 143 new confirmed cases were detected across the country, with the average age of the infected standing at 50 years and the average age of the dead was over 60 years, the head of the Health Ministry's Media Center, Kianoush Jahanpour, said.","EPIDEMICS (96%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (90%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (90%); VIRUSES (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (89%); ABUSE & NEGLECT (78%); DISEASE REPORTING (78%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (78%); NEGATIVE NEWS (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); DEATH RATES (77%); MEDICAL DEVICES (76%); MUSLIMS & ISLAM (74%); DEATH & DYING (67%); RELIGION (56%)

2020-02-29,Iran accused Pompeo of misleading public opinion amid COVID-19,,"By Ryan McMaken*
Mexico's president Andrés Manuel López Obrador has been reluctant to impose mandatory ""social distancing"" orders on the Mexican population. According toUSNews, López Obrador ""has maintained a relaxed public attitude"" toward COVID-19, and the Mexican government did not impose a ban on ""non-essential"" work until March 30, long after health officials in other countries insisted Mexico must do so.
According toDr. Miguel Betancourt, president of the Mexican Society of Public Health, those measures are ""too late"" and ""should have come weeks earlier."" But, even with legal measures in place, it's hard to say how many Mexicans can afford to follow them.The Financial Timeshas describedwhat is likely a common attitude in Mexico:
Salvador Almonte has been doing a roaring trade in antiviral citrus cocktails at his stall in Iztapalapa, a sprawling working-class district of Mexico City. He makes about $9 to $13 a day selling juices and sandwiches and — like his customers — cannot contemplate staying at home to slow the spread of Covid-19. ""We live day to day,"" he said. ""If we don't work, we don't eat.""
...Cuauhtémoc Rivera, head of the Association of Small Businesses, warned that a quarter of a million corner shops could close, with the loss of 500,000 jobs. ... If this goes on for a long time, I don't know how we'll all survive,"" said Enrique Rosas, who has a fleet of 20 taxis.
The Mexican government is right to be hesitant to shut down Mexican businesses. The distance between a ""normal"" economy and grinding poverty is a lot smaller in Mexico than in a wealthy country like the United States or Germany. While mandatory lockdowns in rich countries will cause mass impoverishment — complete with all the usual mental and physical health problems that accompany it — the stakes are even higher in a middle-income country like Mexico.
Moreover, many Mexicans are already suffering from the mandatory shutdowns in the US. In 2019, for example, Mexicans working in the United statessent more than 39 billion dollars back to Mexico. This is a vital lifeline for many Mexicans, and these remittances are likely to be decimated by the government-forced shutdown.
The Financial Timescontinues:
Balancing the competing needs to keep citizens healthy without devastating the economy is particularly tricky in Mexico. ... almost 50 per cent of Mexicans live below the poverty line, another 30 per cent are vulnerable to sinking into poverty and 30m work in the informal sector, where they receive no social benefits.
What Mexico Learned from the H1N1 Panic
This isn't the first time Mexicans have been commanded to lock down their economy to battle a disease.
During the H1N1 pandemic of 2009, Mexican officials closed schools for a week, locked down various businesses, canceled movies, concerts, soccer games, and ""virtually forced the entire population to wear ineffective face masks.""1 Mexico experienced 390 deaths out of a population of 120 million.
This had devastating effects for Mexico's economy, especially its tourist industry.According to The Atlantic Council:
Thecost of the pandemicwas estimated at 1 percent of Mexico's GDP in 2008. ... The A(H1N1) outbreak particularly impacted tourism—an important component of the Mexican economy due to its magnitude and its importance as a source of foreign currency; the tourism industry lost an average of80 percent of its sales. After the first weeks of the quarantine,90 percentof the country's hotel and transportation reservations were canceled, along with 290 cruise ship arrivals. It wasestimatedthat in 2009, Mexico lost $3.4 billion from touristic activities due to the pandemic.
In the immediate aftermath, the Mexican government was praised and congratulated for its actions, but many later admitted the Mexican government had overreacted. According to Jorge Castañeda Gutman, former Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs,
One year later the WHO acknowledged it had exaggerated, and the Mexican government was moderately criticized for the type of measures it took ... ""The government didn't know, or didn't acknowledge, that this response would prove to be undoubtedly more onerous for the country than the epidemic itself.2
This disastrous impact on the Mexican economy informs the debate today in Mexico. According toPhysician's Weekly,
The lesson is not lost on the officials running Mexico's response in 2020, many of whom were also involved in fighting the influenza epidemic. Mexico's economy last year suffered its first recession since 2009. [Deputy Health Minister Hugo] Lopez-Gatell said on [March 17] countries around the world were repeating Mexico's mistake in 2009, making decisions based on anxiety and social pressure rather than science. ... The lesson from the flu epidemic is that acting too soon is counterproductive, he said. ""Acting responsibly, we can't and should not take measures that exhaust our society. Let's not use up all the interventions too soon. Let's keep our calm.""
With the implementation of last week's order, thebusiness shutdowns have now begun. Unemployment will soon follow, but it's unclear how many Mexicans can sit at home and wait things out. Many will be forced in the the informal economy to bring in at least a little income. Since far fewer Mexicans than Americans have jobs that lend themselves to ""working at home,"" keeping food on the table will require flouting demands that Mexicans practice ""social distancing.""
This isn't the say things are proceeding as normal. At leastone study claimsridership on public transport in Mexico has fallen by fifty percent, and traffic congestion has fallen by even more. But even big declines in usually traffic-choked Mexico City hardly signal a situation in which streets are deserted.
How many will studiously avoid human contact outside the home? Mexican business and political culture suggests many will not. The number of annual hours worked per worker is higher in Mexico than any other country.  Moreover, according to Castañeda, Mexicans react with ""skepticism with regard to anything derived from government,"" and this ""individualistic, incredulous attitude"" applies to public health orders as well.3
It may be that many Mexicans will fear COVID-19 more than they feared H1N1. But in Mexico, many are also familiar with the hardships poverty brings, and fear of being destitute may trump fears about the disease. Although wealthy Americans with secure employment and luxurious lifestyles like Anthony Fauci4 continue to insist mass unemployment is merely ""inconvenient,"" few Mexicans have the luxury of such blasé thinking.

2020-04-09,Why Mexico Is Reluctant To Shut Down Its Economy To Combat COVID-19 – OpEd,,"By Rabbi Ron Kronish and Rabbi Allen Maller*
Rabbi Ron Kronish writes of the mounting criticism of the Ultra-Orthodox ""leadership"" in Israel and especially of the leader of one of the main Ultra-Orthodox political parties called United Torah Judaism, Mr. Yaakov Litzman. He and his wife have both tested positive for the corona virus—and endangered the lives of his followers in the ultra-orthodox Jewish community in Israel, as well as the general population of Israel.
First of all, Rabbi Kronish states, as the Minister of Health for the past 9 years (as part of a coalition deal with the Likud party headed by Bibi Netanyahu) he and the Likud-led governments have starved the health system in Israel. Israel's health system has been suffering for many years by not having enough doctors, hospital beds or medical equipment. Israel's health system under Litzman's ""leadership"", or rather, lack of leadership, was not sufficiently prepared for the outbreak of the corona virus.
Leading journalists in Israel are now saying out in the open what many have felt for a long time: Litzman is the wrong man for this job and he must be replaced. One of Israel's leading op-ed writers, Nahum Barnea, (inIsrael's largest circulation Hebrew newspaper), in his column this past Friday, excoriated Litzman for his irresponsible behavior, demonstrating clearly that he has acted in unconscionable ways in recent weeks and recent days that have caused great harm to his own Ultra-Orthodox people and to Israeli society in general.
It all began with the observance of the holiday of Purim five weeks ago (March 9-10, 2020). Public events all over the country were cancelled due to the corona virus, but not public celebrations of the Purim holiday. Litzman found ways to observe Purim in his personal life and he did not demand that Purim celebrations be cancelled in his community or in any community- in Israel.
And it ended last week with Litzman being reported by members of his own community as having violated the orders of his own Health ministry by attending worship service with ten or more men that had been forbidden, in order to prevent the spread of the corona virus in Israel.
And on April 5th, in the prestigiousHaAretznewspaper in Israel (Israel's version of theNewYorkTimes) listed the reasons why Litzman should not be allowed to continue as the Minister of Health:
At the beginning of the coronavirus crisis in Israel, Litzman acted to exclude the ultra-Orthodox community from social-distancing rules and to permit mikvehs (ritual public baths) and synagogues to continue to operate. He even promised that the Messiah would come and eliminate the pandemic.
By now it is totally clear to all rational people in Israel that Litzman is unfit for his position, and is there only for political reasons having to do with building a coalition. Litzman represents the worst mixture of religion with politics in Israel.
Litzman's version of religion—in his case, Ultra-Orthodoxy connected with the Gur Hasidic group—is both anti-modern and anti-Zionist. His brand of extremist other-worldly Judaism rejects science and the scientific method.
Litzman's views are Israel's version of America's evangelical groups-as in the case of Florida and other southern states, where their leadership have been telling their followers –and in some cases are still telling them—to continue to go to worship services, despite what the governmental authorities are telling them about the danger this poses to their own health and the health of the public"" Rabbi Kronish wrote.
And I would add that Litzman's Ultra-Orthodox views are much closer to that of Iran's Imam Muhammad Saeedi. According to the Iranian government, there were two ""patient zeros"", both of whom died in the city of Qom on 19 February. One was a businessman who contracted COVID-19 in China. Qom is an important pilgrimage destination for Shia Muslims and it quickly became the epicenter of the outbreak.
Qom is home to the country's top Islamic clerics, and draws some 20 million domestic and around 2.5 million international tourists a year. Each week, thousands of pilgrims navigate the city, paying their respects by kissing and touching the numerous shrines and landmarks.
Thus the virus spread quickly and the number of cases began to soar. But instead of quickly quarantining the city, representatives of the Supreme Leader - such as cleric Imam Mohammad Saeedi - campaigned for pilgrims to keep on visiting.
""We consider this holy shrine to be a place of healing. That means people should come here to heal from both spiritual and physical diseases."" said Imam Mohammad Saeedi. The city's shrines have now been closed.
""We should have quarantined Qom from day one... this disease is not a joke, which is the way we are dealing with it,"" vice-speaker of Iran's parliament and former Health Minister Massoud Pezeshkian said.
Researchers from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and Virginia Techdeveloped a model that simulates the spread of COVID-19. It uses data on percentage of infected Iranian travelers who tested positive at the point of entry to other countries, as well as numerous medical community estimates, to calculate what they say is a more accurate figure. They estimated that, as of March 20, more than 15,000 Iranians had lost their lives
So between 5,00 (government) and 15,000+ (MIT) Iranians have died because of narrow minded religious politicians in Iran; and while the Ultra-Orthodox are only 11% of Israel's population, they make up more than half of those with Covid-19 in Israel today. 
According to Israel's Health Ministry figures released April 12, based on 96 fatalities collated last week, 51 men died in Israel from COVID-19, compared with 45 women. This is much more even than statistics from Asia and Europe, where a much higher proportion of fatalities are male. 
In the US, for example,twice as many men are dying from the virus as are women. And 69% of all coronavirus deaths across Western Europehave been male. Similar patterns have been seen in China and elsewhere.
The ministry also released figures on infection rates within cities that revealed that the predominantly ultra-Orthodox city of Bnei Brak has the highest concentration of virus cases, with 925 infections diagnosed per every 100,000 people. The second highest rate is in the ultra-Orthodox town of Kiryat Ye'arim, which has 683 cases per 100,000.
And two ultra-Orthodox Brooklyn neighborhoods hard hit by the coronavirus pandemic have also seen a sharp rise in people dying at home, according to a new data analysis released April 17. At-home deaths in Borough Park and Williamsburg and adjacent areas in March and early April were more than 10 times higher than during the same period last year, according to data analysis by the Gothamist news outlet. Across the whole city of New York, at-home deaths have increased almost sixfold, the ProPublica news site found.
The Torah has several commandments regarding personal and public safety. For instance, Jews are instructed to build a fence around any flat roof, to prevent anyone from falling off the roof. The 12th century Spanish/Moroccan Philosopher and M.D. Rabbi Moses Maimonides explains this to include any dangerous situation, such as an unguarded swimming pool.
In addition to removing hazards, the Torah twice commands Jews to protect our health, safety and well being. For example, the Talmud forbids walking near a shaky wall, lest it fall and injure the passerby.

I am sure that Muslam Sharia also contains such statements of caution. But we all need religious leaders who can find them and follow them. Fortunately, the majority of the Israeli government is not politically Orthodox religious and Israel reacted very quickly to the Covis-19 danger.
In terms of deaths from the coronavirus per capita, at the top of the list is Belgium, followed by Spain, Italy, France and the UK. The US is 9th and Israel is currently 27th in the world.

Home Gardens are Traditional Food Sources
According to  Gene Hacker of UNFAO Asian  regional office, globally, home gardens have been documented as an important supplemental source contributing to food and nutritional security and livelihoods.
Food production on small plots adjacent to human settlements is the oldest and most enduring form of cultivation', he said.
For centuries, home gardens have been an integral component of family farming and local food systems. Home gardening is an ancient and widespread practice all over the world. Home gardens are classified as mixed, kitchen, backyard, farmyard, compound or homestead garden.
With the global population expected to reach over 9 billion by 2050, there is a continuous need to increase food production and buffer stocks. In this scenario, countries around the world, especially developing countries where the pervasiveness of hunger and food scarcity is more acute, are resorting to various counter strategies to meet the growing demand and to avert food insecurity and famine, Hacker added.
Homegardens Making a Comeback
Over the recent years there has been growing interest to strengthen and intensify Philippine local food production in order to mitigate the adverse effect of global food shocks and food price volatilities. Consequently, there is much attention towards home gardens as a strategy to enhance household food security and nutrition.
Home gardens are an integral part of local food systems and the agricultural landscape of developing countries all over the world and have endured the test of time, Phil. agriculture Secretary Dr. Dar said.
The vast majority of hungry and malnourished Filipino people live under sub-standard living condition, many  suffer from chronic food insecurity.
With the population expected to reach over 120 million by 2050, there will be a continuous need to increase food production and buffer stocks to meet the growing demand and efficiently cope with volatilities in food production and prices, he said.
The drive for agricultural innovation is further convoluted by the growing issues of climate change and natural resource degradation. Multiple strategies are required to address the issue of food production and food security. The choice of feasible approaches hinges on the existing social, political, and economic conditions and resources available to design and implement the intervention.
Home gardens are a time-tested local strategy that are widely adopted and practiced in various circumstances by local communities with limited resources and institutional support. It is evident from the literature that home gardens are a part of the agriculture and food production systems in many developing countries and are widely used as a remedy to alleviate hunger and malnutrition in the face of a global food crisis .Dr. Dar elaborated.
Globally, home gardens have been documented as an important supplemental source contributing to food and nutritional security and livelihoods. 'Food production on small plots adjacent to human settlements is the oldest and most enduring form of cultivation'.
Traditional home gardens
Home gardens are found in both rural and urban areas in predominantly small-scale subsistence agricultural systems. The very beginning of modern agriculture can be dated back to subsistence production systems that began in small garden plots around the household. These gardens have persistently endured the test of time and continue to play an important role in providing food and income for the family.
The household garden is a small-scale production system supplying plant and animal consumption and utilitarian items either not obtainable, affordable, or readily available through retail markets, field cultivation, hunting, gathering, fishing, and wage earning.
Household gardens tend to be located close to dwelling for security, convenience, and special care. They occupy land marginal to field production and labor marginal to major household economic activities. Featuring ecologically adapted and complementary species, household gardens are marked by low capital input and simple technology.'
Generally, home gardening refers to the cultivation of a small portion of land which may be around the household or within walking distance from the family home .
Home gardens can be described as a mixed cropping system that encompasses vegetables, fruits, plantation crops, spices, herbs, ornamental and medicinal plants as well as.

2020-05-03,Philippines Government Gives Teeth To Vegetable Home Gardening To Survive COVID-19 – OpEd,,"Ramadan, the Islamic month of fasting, is currently being observed by Muslims. However, this time, Muslims are either restricted or strongly discouraged from congregating in the mosques to pray their five-daily prayers. My local Islamic Center has shut its doors for the past seven weeks. Thus, instead of congregational prayers, esp. for the Friday Jumu'ah and Taraweeh (special night prayers during the month of Ramadan), Muslims are now listening to virtual khutbah (sermon) over the computer and praying in their own homes.
With hundreds of thousands of mosques closed down in our planet, this is a unique phenomenon in the Muslim world. Even, the Grand Mosques in Makkah (Ka'bah) and Madinah (Al-Masjid an-Nabawi) are almost empty for weeks because of the Corona Virus (Covid-19) pandemic that has killed more than two hundred thousand people worldwide and infecting another three million people. It is worth mentioning that these courtyards are usually at their busiest during the months of fasting and Hajj but remain open all year round for Muslims to pray therein. 
Saudi Arabia announcedon Tuesday (April 21) that although the Taraweeh prayers will be held at the Grand Mosque and Al-Masjid an-Nabawi only the mosque staff are expected to perform the nightly prayers. King Salman said in a statement, ""I am pained that the holy month arrives amid circumstances that make us unable to perform group prayers and Taraweeh - specialRamadannight prayers - at mosques due to precautionary measures to protect the peoples' lives and health in combating the coronavirus pandemic."" 
Earlier this year, Saudi authorities halted travel to holy sites as part of the umrah, the ""lesser pilgrimage"" that takes place throughout the year. In an unprecedented move, the Kingdom may ban its citizens and foreigners from making the holy pilgrimage this year during the Islamic month of Dhul Hijjah (which falls between July and August this year). So far, more than a hundred Saudis have died because of the Covid-19.
If the Hajj is cancelled this year in Makkah, it won't, however, be the first of its kind in the more than 1,400-year history of the Islamic pilgrimage when its planning had to be altered due to armed conflicts, disease or just plain politics. One of the earliest significant interruptions of the hajj took place in 930 C.E., when a sect of Ismailis, a minority Shi'ite community, known as the Qarmatians, raided Makkah. The Qarmatians killed many pilgrims and fled with the black stone of the Ka'bah to their stronghold in modern-day Bahrain. Hajj was suspended until the Abbasids, a dynasty that ruled over a vast empire stretching across North Africa, the Middle East to modern-day India from 750-1258 C.E., paid a ransom for its return over 20 years later.
The political tug-of-war between the Fatimid rulers of Egypt and the Abbasids kept various pilgrims from Mecca and Medina for eight years, until 991 C.E. French emperor Napoleon's military incursions aimed at checking British colonial influence in the region prevented many pilgrims from hajj between 1798 and 1801 C.E.
There are reports that the first time an epidemic of any kind caused hajj to be canceled was an outbreak of plague in 967 C.E. And drought and famine caused the Fatimid ruler to cancel overland Hajj routes in 1048 C.E. Devastating cholera outbreaks several times throughout the 19th century resulted in the suspension of pilgrimages, including Hajj in 1837 and 1846 C.E. After the disease returned in 1865 in Hejaz, a region of Saudi Arabia that includes Makkah, an international conference was called in Istanbul. Itwas decidedthat quarantine ports would be set up in places like Sinai and Hejaz to help limit the spread of the disease, as pilgrims set on their journey to perform Hajj.
While a decision to cancel the hajj will surely disappoint Muslims looking to perform the pilgrimage, many Muslims are aware of a relevant hadith – a tradition reporting the sayings and practice of the Prophet Muhammad (S) – that provides guidance about traveling during a time of an epidemic: ""If you hear of an outbreak of plague in a land, do not enter it; but if the plague breaks out in a place while you are in it, do not leave that place.""
Globally, nearly 3 million people have been infected by the Covid-19 of which more than two hundred thousand have already died. Here in the USA, nearly a million people have thus far been diagnosed to be infected with the virus, while more than 53 thousand have already died. No cure has yet been found, in spite of all the hullaballoo of President Trump who is proving to be more a TV clown than a serious world leader. As I noted earlier, he is not alone in making a fool of himself. Most of the rulers have been found too unprepared or flat-footed against this virus.
No vaccine or therapeutic medicine has yet been found to combat or contain this virus. As a result, no one truly knows how long this pandemic would last. Nearly a billion people are out of job in our planet. The US economy that had been near full employment just two months ago is now in its most dire straits since the Great Depression. Jobless claims over the past five weeks have totaled more than 26 million, far worse than anything the U.S. has seen. How high that number will get is still unclear when the Labor Department reports the April nonfarm payrolls data in two weeks. Expectations for the April unemployment rate in the USA are in the 10% to 15% range.
Many countries are still under locked-down condition, which is adding to the frustrations of many. The overwhelming fear is that if the pandemic does not kill, hunger might just do that. Thus, the pressure is ever growing for many governments from Trump's USA to Modi's India to ease social-distancing restrictions and open up the business. They are under the catch-22 situation with no easy solutions or answers.
Never before in the history of mankind, has anyone seen a single pandemic shutting down the entire globe in this way. The hustling and bustling mega-cities now look like ghost towns with hardly any movement; the air is much cleaner to breath in, although people are all caged inside their homes and are afraid to go out. People wake up in the morning with the gloomy news of skyrocketing death counts around the globe. People run away from each other, even their loved ones. Niqab, once much abhorred in the West, is now donned by many westerners for mere survival. Nobody is giving Niqab-clad Muslim women a 'dirty' look! The arrogant and the meek, the powerful and the weak, the filthy rich and the dirt poor are all scared the same way. They are even afraid to take their dead family members to the graveyard.
Who would have thought that a small virus that is infinitely smaller than a fly could cause such a panic, crippling the typical life of all humans from a royal prince to an ordinary Joe! Powerful world leaders who not too long ago boasted of being capable of 'Nuking' and pulverizing their foes have proven to be clueless and too impotent to fight this invisible predator. Who would have imagined this turn of events in this age of hyper technology when humans are sending satellites into the outer space!
What went wrong?
I asked the question some weeks ago to Shaykh Abu Fida K.T. Nephtchy, a Turkish Sufi master who lives in Los Angeles. He advised me to read Surah Ar-Rum and ponder on the verse 41.
Allah says in the Qur'an: ""Fasad (corruption) has appeared throughout the land and sea because of what the hands of people have earned (by oppression and evil deeds, etc.) so He (Allah) may let them taste part of [the consequence of] what they have done that perhaps they will return [to righteousness]."" (Surah Ar-Rum 30:41)
In Surah An-Nahl, Allah also says: 'And Allah set forth an example of a town that is safe (of fear) and well content. Its means of subsistence was coming in abundance from everywhere. But it (the people of the town) denied the Blessings of Allah. Therefore Allah caused it to taste the garb of famine and fear because of what they did.' [Qur'an 16:112].
It is a time of deep reflection for all. Is it possible that the Covid-19 pandemic is a taste of consequences of human wrongdoings and disobedience to their Creator? Is it possible that in our lust for the duniya (inane materialism) we all became too 'materialistic' and forgot about the Akhirah (the Hereafter) and how worthless we truly are without the blessings of our Creator?
Maybe that this Ramadan, as we kneel down and prostrate in our prayers, we shall be more sincere and grateful to and mindful of Allah and His provisions, and work more seriously towards making our planet a better one that is free of fitnah (unrest, civil strife, conflict) and fasad.

2020-04-26,Ramadan Reflections In The Midst Of COVID-19 – OpEd,,"After the disastrous mishandling of its COVID-19 battle, the Trump White House blames China for the virus, at the cost of American lives and worst contraction since the 1930s.
Ironically, President Trump thanked President Xi for China's success in the virus battle in late January. But he adopted a very different tone as the White House mishandled the outbreak permitting the virus to spread in America [for the full story, see my COVID-19 report, The Tragedy of Missed Opportunities].
In fact, Trump's own cabinet took an adversarial stance from the beginning. If the escalation will continue, that stance could result in a new Cold War and the Second Global Depression in the coming years.
Blaming China for Trump's COVID-19 mishandling
The efforts to exploit the crisis for political purposes began early in the year. On January 30, right after the 'Phase 1' trade deal and the national virus emergency in China, Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross declared the outbreak in China would benefit US manufacturing and bring jobs back to America. He was seconded by Trump's trade advisor, Peter Navarro, who pledged US tariffs on Chinese imports would not be lifted even if the deadly coronavirus weighs on China's economy.
Despite the first novel coronavirus cases in the US, both Ross and Navarro apparently presumed the virus would not spread in America.
Between early January and mid-March, the Trump White House's accusations against China intensified with broad criticism of the administration's mishandling of the outbreak, particularly as US debate escalated over botched evacuations, faulty test kits and delays in testing, shortages of personal protective equipment (PPE) and additional PPE shortages due to tariff wars, failed responses and associated elevated health risks, inadequate quarantines, failed self-quarantines, premature exits from lockdowns and the list goes on.
That's when politicized attacks were initiated by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar who blamed China for the U.S. virus crisis. Meanwhile, Trump sought to ""talk down"" the virus impact in the markets.
When the WHO declared the global emergency on Jan 30, Trump still claimed that ""we have it very well under control."" Even in early March, he described the virus as ""very mild"" and said the infected could get better by ""going to work.""
Ironically, as the Trump White House repeatedly labelled the virus a ""China virus"" or ""Wuhan virus,"" that fostered a perception that the outbreak would be limited to China, while it was actually exploding in America and Europe.
When these deflection efforts failed to halt public criticism of the administration, the Trump White House began to exploit even reputable media to launder unsubstantiated intelligence meant to ratchet up tensions with China. The hope is that scapegoating – the ""Chinagate"" – would steer attention away from the Trump administration's catastrophic disastrous mishandling of the COVID-19 crisis.
That's why the politicized efforts to re-redefine the COVID-19 as the ""China virus"" continued into late March (and prevail even today). That's when the numbers of US virus cases and deaths began to soar.
Use of scapegoats in paranoid politics
Instead of international cooperation to beat the pandemic, the Trump White House and its Republican supporters are on a survival mode. They hope to ensure Trump's second term. That's why another critical moment was missed when Pompeo called for COVID-19 to be identified as the ""Wuhan virus"" at the G7 Summit in late March.
Obviously, European officials resisted the redefinition since the WHO had cautioned against giving the virus a geographic name because of its global nature. But in the process, precious time was missed as US domestic political priorities overrode the urgency for international cooperation against the global pandemic (Figure).
Figure China as the Scapegoat for U.S. Mishandling of the Pandemic
The purposeful use of projective bashing of targeted scapegoats has a long history in US politics. In the mid-1960s, Richard Hofstadter, the iconic historian of postwar liberal consensus, defined it as a recurring ""paranoid style in American politics.""
In the effort to explain away the presence of class, ethnic, and immigration divisions in America, this style projects such divides onto other countries, real or imaginary adversaries, as evidenced by the 1950s McCarthyism, the Trump administration's controversial ties with the U.S. alt-right movement, and Trump's personal paranoid style that sparked warnings by leading American psychiatrists and psychologists already three years ago (The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump, 2017).
These views have been echoed by former US ambassador to China Max Baucus, who recently warned that he feared the Trump administration's rhetoric against China was leading the US into an era ""which is similar to Joe McCarthy back when he was red-baiting the State Department, attacking communism.""
Months of missed opportunities
The Trump administration knew about the virus risks already by January 3, when CDC Director Dr. Robert R. Redfield called Secretary of Health Azar, telling him China had discovered a new coronavirus. Azar made sure the National Security Council (NSC) knew about the virus because in early 2017 Trump had eliminated NSC's global health unit, despite warnings about possible future pandemics.
As the New York Times has reported, the new virus team began daily meetings in the basement of the West Wing, yet no mobilization was initiated. Rather, a long debate began within the White House over ""what to tell to the American public,"" even as Trump, Pompeo and Azar blamed China for the lack of transparency.
Although the government's leading scientists and health experts raised the alarm early and pushed for aggressive action, they faced resistance at the White House. Trump didn't want markets to be spooked by panic. As a result, misguided political priorities continue to override science-based policies stressing public health.
The cult of secrecy in the White House has not eased. In mid-April, Dr Anthony Fauci, a key member of the virus task force, was asked by the CNN, whether earlier mitigation efforts could have saved more lives. Truthfully, he admitted: ""If we had right from the very beginning shut everything down, it may have been a little bit different. But there was a lot of pushback about shutting things down back then."" Hours later, Trump retweeted a user who said it was ""Time to #FireFauci.""
The recent confrontation between Trump and Fauci about the dangers of a premature exit from the lockdown is still another example of Trump's political priorities, at the expense of American lives and U.S. economy.
Whatever the ultimate reason for the painfully long delay in the mobilization against the virus in America, the fact remains that, like Hong Kong and Singapore after January 3, the Trump White House could have begun the virus battle proactively.
For almost three months, it chose not to. And when it could no longer could hide its catastrophic mistake, the White House blamed China for the catastrophe.

2020-05-21,China As COVID-19 Scapegoat – OpEd,,"The Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi has shared few thoughts on Linkedin, which would interest youngsters and professionals.
Following is the text of Prime Minister, Shri Narendra Modi's thoughts which was shared on Linkedin.
""It has been a topsy-turvy start to the third decade of this century. COVID-19 has brought with it many disruptions. Coronavirus has significantly changed the contours of professional life. These days, home is the new office. The Internet is the new meeting room. For the time being, office breaks with colleagues are history.
I have also been adapting to these changes. Most meetings, be it with minister colleagues, officials and world leaders, are now via video conferencing. In order to get ground level feedback from various stakeholders, there have been videoconference meetings with several sections of society. There were extensive interactions with NGOs, civil society groups and community organisations. There was an interaction with Radio Jockeys too.
Besides that, I have been making numerous phone calls daily, taking feedback from different sections of society.
One is seeing the ways through which people are continuing their work in these times. There are a few creative videos by our film stars conveying a relevant message of staying home. Our singers did an online concert. Chess players played chess digitally and through that contributed to the fight against COVID-19. Quite innovative!
The work place is getting Digital First. And, why not?
After all, the most transformational impact of Technology often happens in the lives of the poor. It is technology that demolishes bureaucratic hierarchies, eliminates middlemen and accelerates welfare measures.
Let me give you an example. When we got the opportunity to serve in 2014, we started connecting Indians, especially the poor with their Jan Dhan Account, Aadhar & Mobile number.
This seemingly simple connection has not only stopped corruption and rent seeking that was going on for decades, but has also enabled the Government to transfer money at the click of a button. This click of a button has replaced multiple levels of hierarchies on the file and also weeks of delay.
India has perhaps the largest such infrastructure in the world. This infrastructure has helped us tremendously in transferring money directly and immediately to the poor and needy, benefiting crores of families, during the COVID-19 situation.
Another case in point is the education sector. There are many outstanding professionals already innovating in this sector. Invigorating technology in this sector has its benefits. The Government of India has also undertaken efforts such as the DIKSHA Portal, to help teachers and boost e-learning. There is SWAYAM, aimed at improving access, equity and quality of education. E-Pathshala, which is available in many languages, enables access to various e-books and such learning material.
Today, the world is in pursuit of new business models.
India, a youthful nation known for its innovative zeal can take the lead in providing a new work culture.
I envision this new business and work culture being redefined on the following vowels.
I call them- vowels of the new normal- because like vowels in the English language, these would become essential ingredients of any business model in the post-COVID world.
Adaptability:
The need of the hour is to think of business and lifestyle models that are easily adaptable.
Doing so would mean that even in a time of crisis, our offices, businesses and commerce could get moving faster, ensuring loss of life does not occur.
Embracing digital payments is a prime example of adaptability. Shop owners big and small should invest in digital tools that keep commerce connected, especially in times of crisis. India is already witnessing an encouraging surge in digital transactions.
Another example is telemedicine. We are already seeing several consultations without actually going to the clinic or hospital. Again, this is a positive sign. Can we think of business models to help further telemedicine across the world?
Efficiency:
Perhaps, this is the time to think of reimagining what we refer to as being efficient. Efficiency cannot only be about- how much time was spent in the office.
We should perhaps think of models where productivity and efficiency matter more than appearance of effort. The emphasis should be on completing a task in the specified time frame.
Inclusivity:
Let us develop business models that attach primacy to care for the poor, the most vulnerable as well as our planet.
We have made major progress in combating climate change. Mother Nature has demonstrated to us her magnificence, showing us how quickly it can flourish when human activity is slower. There is a significant future in developing technologies and practices that reduce our impact on the planet. Do more with less.
COVID-19 has made us realise the need to work on health solutions at low cost and large scale. We can become a guiding light for global efforts to ensure the health and well being of humanity.
We should invest in innovations to make sure our farmers have access to information, machinery, and markets no matter what the situation, that our citizens have access to essential goods.
Opportunity:
Every crisis brings with it an opportunity. COVID-19 is no different. Let us evaluate what might be the new opportunities/growth areas that would emerge now.
Rather than playing catch up, India must be ahead of the curve in the post-COVID world. Let us think about how our people, our skills sets, our core capabilities can be used in doing so.
Universalism:
COVID-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or border before striking. Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood. We are in this together.
Unlike previous moments in history, when countries or societies faced off against each other, today we are together facing a common challenge. The future will be about togetherness and resilience.
The next big ideas from India should find global relevance and application. They should have the ability to drive a positive change not merely for India but for the entire humankind.
Logistics was previously only seen through the prism of physical infrastructure - roads, warehouses, ports. But logistical experts these days can control global supply chains through the comfort of their own homes.
India, with the right blend of the physical and the virtual can emerge as the global nerve centre of complex modern multinational supply chains in the post COVID-19 world. Let us rise to that occasion and seize this opportunity.
I urge you all to think about this and contribute to the discourse.
The shift from BYOD to WFH brings new challenges to balance the official and personal. Whatever be the case, devote time to fitness and exercising. Try Yoga as a means to improve physical and mental well being.
Traditional medicine systems of India are known to help keep the body fit. The Ayush Ministry has come out with a protocol that would help in staying healthy. Have a look at these as well.
Lastly, and importantly, please download Aarogya Setu Mobile App. This is a futuristic App that leverages technology to help contain the possible spread of COVID-19. More the downloads, more its effectiveness.
Will wait to hear from you all.""

2020-04-22,Life in the Era of COVID-19 [opinion],,"The story of U.S. leadership in the global battle against Covid-19 is a story of days, months, and decades. Every day, new U.S. technical and material assistance arrives in hospitals and labs around the world. These efforts, in turn, build on a decades-long foundation of American expertise, generosity, and planning that is unmatched in history.
The United States provides aid for altruistic reasons, because we believe it's the right thing to do. We also do it because pandemics don't respect national borders. If we can help counties contain outbreaks, we'll save lives abroad and at home in the U.S.
That generosity and pragmatism explains why United States was one of the first countries to help to the Chinese people as soon as reports emerged from Wuhan of another outbreak. In early January, the United States government offered immediate technical assistance to the Chinese Centers for Disease Control.
In the first week of February, the U.S. transported nearly 18 tons of medical supplies to Wuhan provided by Samaritan's Purse, The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, and others. We also pledged $100 million in assistance to countries to fight what would become a pandemic - including an offer to China, which was declined.
Our response now far surpasses that initial pledge. Since the outbreak of COVID-19, the U.S. government has committed nearly $500 million in assistance to date. This funding will improve public health education, protect healthcare facilities, and increase laboratory, disease-surveillance, and rapid-response capacity in more than 60 of the world's most at risk countries- all in an effort to help contain outbreaks before they reach our shores.
Our aid helps people in the most dire circumstances. For instance, the U.S. government works with NGOs to deliver medicines, medical supplies, and food to the Syrian people, including those living in regime-held areas. We are helping United Nations agencies and nongovernmental organizations build more water, sanitation and health facilities across northern Syria to prevent the spread of the virus. We are aiding friends from Africa to Asia, and beyond.
America's unsurpassed contributions are also felt through the many international organizations fighting Covid-19 on the front lines.
The U.S. has been the largest funder of the World Health Organization since its founding in 1948. We gave more than $400 million to the institution in 2019 - nearly double the second-largest contribution and more than the next three contributors combined.
It's a similar story with the U.N. Refugee Agency, which the U.S. backed with nearly $1.7 billion in 2019. That's more than all other member states combined, and more than four times the second-largest contributor, Germany.
Then there is the World Food Program, to which the U.S. gave $3.4 billion last year, or 42% of its total budget. That's nearly four times the second-largest contributor, and more than all other member states combined. We also gave more than $700 million to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF), more than any other donor.
We are proud that when these international organizations deliver food, medicines, and other aid all around the world, that too is largely thanks to the generosity of the American people, in partnership with donor nations.
Our country continues to be the single largest health and humanitarian donor for both long-term development and capacity building efforts with partners, and emergency response efforts in the face of recurrent crises. This money has saved lives, protected people who are most vulnerable to disease, built health institutions, and promoted the stability of communities and nations.
America funds nearly 40% of the world's global health assistance programs, adding up to $140 billion in investments in the past 20 years - five times more than the next largest donor. Since 2009, American taxpayers have generously funded more than $100 billion in health assistance and nearly $70 billion in humanitarian assistance globally.
Through that assistance, including as the single largest contributor to the World Health Organization's budget, the United States stands shoulder to shoulder with the people and government of The Gambia as we face - together - the threat this virus poses. I and my team at the U.S. Embassy will continue our work to coordinate assistance with other donor countries and organizations, to support the truly heroic work being done by Gambians from Kartong to Koina. United, together, we will defeat COVID-19.
Our help is much more than money and supplies. It's the experts we have deployed worldwide, and those still conducting tutorials today via teleconference. It's the doctors and public-health professionals trained, thanks to U.S. money and educational institutions. And it's the supply chains that we keep open and moving for U.S. companies producing and distributing high-quality critical medical supplies around the world.
Of course, it isn't just our government helping the world. American businesses, NGOs, and faith-based organizations have given at least $1.5 billion to fight the pandemic overseas. American companies are innovating new technologies for vaccines, therapeutics, diagnostics, and ventilators. This is American exceptionalism at its finest.
As we have time and time again, the United States will aid others during their time of greatest need. The COVID-19 pandemic is no different. We will continue to help countries build resilient health care systems that can prevent, detect, and respond to infectious disease outbreaks. Just as the U.S. has made the world more healthy, peaceful, and prosperous for generations, so will we lead in defeating our shared pandemic enemy, and rising stronger in its wake.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); PUBLIC HEALTH (91%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); RELIGION (90%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); FOOD ASSISTANCE (89%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (89%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (89%); NONGOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (89%); RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS (89%); UNITED NATIONS (89%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (87%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (87%); INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS & BODIES (78%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEILLANCE (78%); EPIDEMIOLOGY (75%); CHRISTIANS & CHRISTIANITY (73%); HEALTH EDUCATION (72%); FOOD CHARITIES (71%); REFUGEES (71%); SOCIAL SCIENCE EDUCATION (71%); SURVEILLANCE (68%); MORMONS & MORMONISM (52%); Gambia (%); Coronavirus (%)

2020-04-15,United We Will Defeat COVID-19 [opinion],,"The Aboitiz Group has reassured customers of its continuous operation while imposing health and safety protocols due to the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic.
This, as the firm manages critical industries such as power, banking and financial services, food, land, and infrastructure, including cement manufacturing and construction.
Sabin Aboitiz, company president and chief executive officer, shared the commitment to keep its businesses running smoothly to help the country's economy to weather the challenges posed by the health crisis.
Aboitiz said his team regularly inspects current operations at AP Renewables, Inc. Makiling-Banahaw (MakBan) Geothermal Power Plant, and its other businesses to check on the working conditions of the team members and front-line workers.
Aboitiz is committed to provide unhampered delivery of products and services across critical sectors that will help keep our economy moving, he said in a statement on Tuesday.
The group will continue to provide reliable and ample power supply to the country; ensure food security along with our partners; continue to create better ways to live; and ensure enough and domestically-produced cement of good quality to support the country's infrastructure initiatives, he added.
In all these visits, Aboitiz said these facilities are carefully following strict pre-entry safety requirements, health screening, and other safety protocols.
On top of keeping unhampered operations on various work sites and business facilities, the most important thing is ensuring that our team members especially those in the frontlines, those who are keeping the lights on; those who are keeping the machines running; and those who are building our homes one brick at a time are well taken-cared of; that they are healthy, safe and their needs are met, Aboitiz said.
To ensure a safe working environment, Republic Cement Batangas plant manager Erwin Cruz said strict pre-entry screening requirements and health protocols greet guests and visitors in all Aboitiz business sites, including temperature check, proper hand hygiene, wearing of masks and physical distancing.
Upon entry, both employees and visitors are met with constant reminders on physical distancing, frequent hand sanitation, proper wearing of masks, and personal protective equipment on site.
Meanwhile, at the Seafront Residences, Aboitiz inspected completed houses and amenities as well as future areas for development.
The AboitizLand, through its assistant vice president for customer management, Monica Trajano, was able to highlight its successes and initiatives towards meeting the construction goals despite the challenges brought about by the pandemic.
To date, the Aboitiz Group has contributed nearly PHP2.2 billion for its Covid-19 response efforts to the country's economy.
The amount excludes various payments waived, reduced, extended or restructured credit to help customers cope with the impact of the pandemic. - PNA","COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); BUSINESS NEWS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES & WORKERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); SAFETY (90%); SAFETY REGULATION & POLICY (90%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (89%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); BUSINESS OPERATIONS (79%); NEWS BRIEFS (79%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); MANAGERS & SUPERVISORS (78%); MEDICAL DIAGNOSTICS, SCREENING & TESTING (78%); PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (78%); SAFETY STANDARDS (78%); SAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (78%); VIRUSES (78%); WORKPLACE HEALTH & SAFETY (78%); EXECUTIVES (77%); FOOD SECURITY (77%); LABOR & EMPLOYMENT (77%); NEGATIVE NEWS (77%); TALKS & MEETINGS (76%)

2020-09-03,Philippines : Aboitiz Group reassures continuous business ops amid Covid-19,,"London: University College London has issued the following news release:
Vageesh Jain, NIHR Academic Clinical Fellow in Public Health Medicine, UCL
Mandatory vaccination does not automatically increase vaccine uptake. An EU-funded project on epidemics and pandemics, which took place several years before Covid-19, found no evidence to support this notion. Looking at Baltic and Scandinavian countries, the project's report noted that countries “where a vaccination is mandatory do not usually reach better coverage than neighbour or similar countries where there is no legal obligation”.
According to the Nuffield Council of Bioethics, mandatory vaccination may be justified for highly contagious and serious diseases. But although contagious, Public Health England does not classify Covid-19 as a high-consequence infectious disease due to its relatively low case fatality rate.
Covid-19 severity is strongly linked with age, dividing individual perceptions of vulnerability within populations. The death rate is estimated at 7.8% in people aged over 80, but at just 0.0016% in children aged nine and under. In a liberal democracy, forcing the vaccination of millions of young and healthy citizens who perceive themselves to be at an acceptably low risk from Covid-19 will be ethically disputed and is politically risky.
Public apprehensions for a novel vaccine produced at breakneck speed are wholly legitimate. A UK survey of 70,000 people found 49% were “very likely” to get a Covid-19 vaccine once available. US surveys are similar. This is not because the majority are anti-vaxxers.
Despite promising headlines, the trials and pharmaceutical processes surrounding them have not yet been scrutinised. With the first trials only beginning in April, there is limited data on long-term safety and efficacy. We don't know how long immunity lasts for. None of the trials were designed to tell us if the vaccine prevents serious disease or virus transmission.
To disregard these ubiquitous concerns would be counterproductive. As a tool for combating anti-vaxxers – estimated at around 58 million globally and making up a small minority of those not getting vaccinated – mandatory vaccines are also problematic. The forces driving scientific and political populism are the same. Anti-vaxxers do not trust experts, industry and especially not the government. A government mandate will not just be met with unshakeable defiance, but will also be weaponised to recruit others to the anti-vaxxer cause.
In the early 1990s, polio was endemic in India, with between 500 and 1,000 children getting paralysed daily. By 2011, the virus was eliminated. This was not achieved through legislation. It was down to a consolidated effort to involve communities, target high-need groups, understand concerns, inform, educate, remove barriers, invest in local delivery systems and link with political and religious leaders.
Mandatory vaccination is rarely justified. The successful roll-out of novel Covid-19 vaccines will require time, communication and trust. We have come too far, too fast, to lose our nerve now.
Dr Alberto Giubilini, Senior Research Fellow, Oxford Martin Programme on Collective Responsibility for Infectious Disease, University of Oxford
Covid-19 vaccination should be mandatory – at least for certain groups. This means there would be penalties for failure to vaccinate, such as fines or limitations on freedom of movement.
The less burdensome it is for an individual to do something that prevents harm to others, and the greater the harm prevented, the stronger the ethical reason for mandating it.
Being vaccinated dramatically reduces the risk of seriously harming or killing others. Vaccines such as the Pfizer, AstraZeneca or Moderna ones with 90-95% efficacy at preventing people from getting sick are also likely to be effective at stopping the virus from spreading, though possibly to a lower degree. Such benefits would come at a very minimal cost to individuals.
Lockdown is mandatory. Exactly like mandatory vaccination, it protects vulnerable people from Covid-19. But, as I have argued in detail elsewhere, unlike mandatory vaccination, lockdown entails very large individual and societal costs. It is inconsistent to accept mandatory lockdown but reject mandatory vaccination. The latter can achieve a much greater good at a much smaller cost.
Also, mandatory vaccination ensures that the risks and burdens of reaching herd immunity are distributed evenly across the population. Because herd immunity benefits society collectively, it's only fair that the responsibility of reaching it is shared evenly among society's individual members.
Of course, we might achieve herd immunity through less restrictive alternatives than making vaccination mandatory – such as information campaigns to encourage people to be vaccinated. But even if we reach herd immunity, the higher the uptake of vaccines, the lower the risk of falling below the herd immunity threshold at a later time. We should do everything we can to prevent that emergency from happening – especially when the cost of doing so is low.
Fostering trust and driving uptake by making people more informed is a nice narrative, but it's risky. Merely giving people information on vaccines does not always result in increased willingness to vaccinate and might actually lower confidence in vaccines. On the other hand, we've seen mandatory vaccination policies in Italy recently successfully boost vaccine uptake for other diseases.
Mandatory seatbelt policies have proven very successful in reducing deaths from car accidents, and are now widely endorsed despite the (very small) risks that seatbelts entail. We should see vaccines as seatbelts against Covid-19. In fact, as very special seatbelts, which protect ourselves and protect others.","EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (99%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); MANDATORY VACCINATIONS (93%); VACCINES (93%); PUBLIC HEALTH (92%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (92%); MANDATORY COVID VACCINATIONS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); ETHICS (90%); HEALTH CARE REGULATION & POLICY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (90%); ANTI-VACCINE MOVEMENT (89%); EUROPEAN UNION (89%); CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS & TEENS (88%); BIOETHICS (78%); DEMOCRACIES (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); POLITICAL & SOCIAL IDEOLOGIES (78%); POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS (78%); POPULISM (78%); SAFETY (78%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (78%); DEATH & DYING (75%); DEATH RATES (74%); BIOLOGICS MFG (73%); LIBERALISM (73%); MINORITY GROUPS (73%); CLERGY & RELIGIOUS VOCATIONS (50%); RELIGION (50%)

2020-12-02,Opinion: Should Covid-19 vaccines be mandatory?,,"By Faisal J. Abbas*
The most powerful weapons of mass destruction, the most terrible natural disasters, and the most vicious terrorist attacks have all failed to inflict upon 21st-century humanity the destruction caused by a single, tiny virus.
Medical researchers have expressed it clearly and directly; as long as there is one person with COVID-19 in the world, the possibility of another pandemic remains.
Can it be that the SARS-CoV-2 virus, an entity with no mind capable of thinking, observing or planning, has nevertheless discovered our weakness as human beings, our Achilles' heel — our need to be together?
For no digital app can make up for our need to hug those we love, kiss our parents' foreheads, shake hands with those we meet, attend weddings or perform a duty of solace.
No virtual reality tool can compensate for our instinct to travel.
No distance learning program can provide the benefit a student obtains when interacting with their classmates in person under the supervision of a teacher, no matter how sophisticated the algorithms.
In just four months, this virus has wiped out thousands of years of social traditions and customs, forcing us to hide in homes that have become more like the caves that sheltered the first human beings (though, thankfully, our ""caves"" are safer, air-conditioned, and equipped with electricity and wifi).
It is hard to believe that this virus has no intelligence, when it seems to have learned how to present a deadlier challenge than any we have faced before.
Cholera was transmitted in polluted water; we beat that. HIV was transmitted through direct sexual contact or infected blood; we beat that.
But this virus requires only a handshake, a conversation, or even touching the same elevator button as an infected person.
Not even acute respiratory diseases such as SARS and MERS were so aggressively contagious.
And we still do not know whether a patient recovering from COVID-19 will have permanent immunity; or if the summer heat will reduce its spread, as happened with SARS.
Even if we found a cure and a vaccine today, there is no guarantee that ""COVID-20,"" or another developed virus that is more deadly and contagious, will not emerge within months.
Can our human psyche, not to mention the global economy, endure a second wave of infection, forced confinement, bankruptcies, and death?
""Survival of the fittest"" is the phrase used to describe the evolutionist Charles Darwin's concept of natural selection, which means that those who survive will be those who are best adapted for their immediate environment.
Our immediate environment is polluted with coronavirus, and it kills the weakest among us — the elderly, the newborn, those with chronic diseases, and those with a weak immune system.
It will not affect, for example, Cristiano Ronaldo, the world's wealthiest footballer currently spending his virus confinement in a luxury mansion on his native Portuguese island of Madeira, in the same way as it will affect the people of sub-Saharan Africa, 63 percent of whom lack the basic resources to wash their hands with soap and water.
The pandemic has caused a temporary attrition of the funds of giant corporations, but they will emerge from it safe, sound and perhaps even more powerful after acquiring their competitors, or benefiting from their resources to enter new sectors.
For example, Amazon, taking advantage of the increased demand for online shopping, is hiring 175,000 staff to keep up with home deliveries.
On the other hand, many small businesses will go bankrupt, especially in countries that lack the resources to support their economies with long-term subsidies, exemptions and grants.
The same applies at state level; the affluence, health and hygiene of individual societies, the ratio of youth to the elderly, the extent to which governments can control the discipline and compliance of their people with laws and regulations, and the existence of independent and empowered government institutions, will undoubtedly affect the condition in which each country emerges from this pandemic.
The virus has also exposed another weakness in many countries, including the greatest ones; their dependence on third parties for the manufacture and supply of health equipment and medication.
The pandemic is increasing and enhancing international cooperation, not the other way around — something we began to see in recent G20 resolutions, under this year's Saudi presidency.
New alliances, or an increase in the effectiveness of old ones, loom on the horizon.
This is no longer a luxury but a need, because the pandemic has hit everyone. The only way out is to join hands and work together to defeat it.

 Photo by Susan J. Demas The COVID-19 pandemic affected all of us, but communities of color have been disproportionately affected. From loss of lives to the economic impact, the toll has been heavy. 
 After over a year of lockdown and physical distancing, the country is reopening. 
 Unfortunately, our communities are not recovering at the same pace as the rest of the state. Immigrants of color carried Minnesota's economy during the pandemic as frontline workers, and we are demanding our elected officials make policies that intentionally respond to our needs and our concerns. 
 During the pandemic we at African Career, Education and Resources Inc., or ACER, have assisted 1,500 families in need of rent support who have been working on the frontlines to keep the economy running. According to a survey we conducted, a majority of low-income tenants in the northwest suburbs won't be able to recover from the pandemic without an extension on the eviction moratorium and extra housing assistance. 
 We have also assisted over 600 micro-entrepreneurs and Minnesotans in need of economic support. Our economic development programs are a life support for folks, but the program needs more support to be extended to more communities. We are working with community leaders and organizations to build a grassroots-led recovery for a stronger and more vibrant economy. 
 'It is about being more creative in the policies, and getting to the root of the inequities of the wealth gap for communities,' said Denise Butler, our director of economic development, who is trying to help our businesses thrive. 
 Vaccine hesitancy is real, but according to our community survey, people are getting vaccinated at far greater rates when it is convenient and accessible for them. We need new approaches on accessibility and messaging around vaccination. 
 The African immigrant community makes up a huge part of the health care personnel in the state and should be part of decision making on how to vaccinate their communities 
 To make the reopening and COVID-19 recovery inclusive and equitable, we must invest directly in the communities that have been most impacted. Immigrants are the backbone of our state and our country, and a strong and healthy immigrant community is a stronger Minnesota. 
 We call on Gov. Tim Walz and leaders in the Legislature to deliver on promises made during the pandemic and to do more to provide adequate solutions. ACER joins voices with our community partners to demand concrete and targeted actions to make sure our community gets the support we need to recover from the pandemic fully and fairly.","EPIDEMICS (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); HOUSING ASSISTANCE (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); VACCINES (90%); BUSINESS NEWS (89%); ECONOMIC NEWS (89%); EVICTION (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (77%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (77%); ECONOMIC INEQUALITY (77%); ENTREPRENEURSHIP (77%); POLLS & SURVEYS (77%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (76%); PUBLIC OFFICIALS (76%); ECONOMICS (72%); FAMILY (72%); ELECTIONS & POLITICS (70%); PUBLIC HOUSING (69%); LOW INCOME PERSONS (68%); Commentary (%); Featured (%)

2021-06-04,Minnesota must remember African immigrants as we craft COVID-19 recovery plans | Opinion,,"By Martin Jacques*
During January the onslaught in the Western media, notably the US and the UK, against the Chinese government's handling of the Covid-19 epidemic, was merciless. The Chinese government stood accused of an inhumane attitude towards its people, secrecy, a cover-up, and an overwhelming concern for its own survival above all other considerations.
The actual evidence was thin bordering at times on the threadbare but this made little difference to the venom and bile of the assault.
Certainly, it seems clear, there was a deliberate attempt to forestall and hinder the necessary timely action in Wuhan, and more widely in Hubei, but with the benefit of hindsight the time lost as a result proved relatively marginal compared with that lost in the West in their belief that it could not possibly happen to them, that China was to blame, and in their failure to learn from China's experience.
To have used the tragedy of the coronavirus epidemic, with all the deaths, illness and suffering that ensued, as a stick with which to beat the Chinese government – and the Chinese people – was nothing short of a disgrace.
When the Chinese needed compassion, support and solidarity, they received ridicule, calumny and barely-concealed racism. One might ask why this was. Western prejudice against China is historically deeply-rooted and continues to influence contemporary Western attitudes.
Over the last few years, however, especially since around 2016, the incidence of China-bashing has become much more common. There has been a growing sense of resentment towards China's rise, especially and predictably in the US, but elsewhere too, combined with a desire to reassert and restore the old global pecking order and the established economic, political and ethnic hierarchies.
The main subject of China-bashing has been its governing system. The coronavirus epidemic offered, on the surface at least, ideal ground on which to attack China's governance: it was covering up, it didn't care, its own survival came first.
How wrong and misconceived these West prejudices proved to be. After initial dithering, hesitation, and wrong-turns, once China grasped the nature and profound dangers that the virus posed for the Chinese people, its approach was nothing short of brilliant, an example and inspiration for all.
For China, we must never forget that it was an entirely new and mysterious challenge. All subsequent countries could learn from China's experience. China did not even know what the virus was. It had to establish that it was entirely new and work out its genome and its characteristics, which it immediately shared with the world.
And it grasped with remarkable alacrity that the epidemic required the most dramatic measures, including the lockdown not just of Wuhan but all major cities and most of the country, and quarantining the population.
The government understood that life came before the economy. Its extraordinary and decisive leadership met with an equally extraordinary and proactive response from the people: it was a classic case of the government and the people as one.
The results are there for all to see. New cases have been reduced to a trickle. Slowly, step by step, the economy is being rekindled. Bit by bit China is returning to normal. For those wanting to avoid coronavirus, China is fast becoming the safest place on earth.
Indeed, China's problem is fast becoming visiting foreign tourists suffering from the virus and reintroducing it into their country.
Meanwhile Europe and North America are facing a coronavirus tsunami: Italy is the worst case but others such as Spain, France, Germany and the UK are rapidly following in its slipstream.
Soon the whole of Europe will be engulfed in the epidemic. And America, far from being immune, as President Trump believed, has itself declared a state of emergency to deal with a virus which it dismissed and ignored as a 'foreign virus'.
The West – and, above all, its people – are destined to pay a huge price for its hubris, its belief that coronavirus was a Chinese problem that could never become a Western problem. Too late, alas, having wasted all the time that China gave them, all the knowledge that China had acquired on how to tackle the virus, Western governments are now faced with a fearful challenge.
Back in January they accused the Chinese government of wasting a fortnight; now it is revealed to the world that Western governments wasted a minimum of two and a half months.
The tide has turned. In the greatest health crisis for one hundred years, China's governance has risen to the challenge and delivered a mortal blow to coronavirus.
In contrast, Western governance has proven to be blinded by its own hubris, unable to learn from China until far too late, ill-equipped to grasp the kind of radical action that is required of it. Trump is still largely in denial, while the UK government is acting far too late.
I cannot think of any other example which so patently reveals the sheer competence and capacity of Chinese governance and the inferiority and infirmity of Western governance. In their hour of need, the latter has let their peoples down.
Meanwhile the Western criticism of China has fallen almost, but not quite entirely, silent. They have no alternative, as Italy shows, but to learn from China's draconian measures.
What else can they do? China has succeeded. They have, in truth, nowhere else to turn. Learn from China they must. But for many it is a bitter pill to swallow.
The wheels of history are turning, irresistibly, towards China. And China must respond in humility by offering all the assistance and experience it can offer the West.

2020-03-30,Chinese Vs. Western Governance: The Case Of COVID-19 – OpEd,,"By Peter Andrews*
Facebook and Twitter have taken down the US president's claims on the insusceptibility of children to Covid-19 – a fact on which the science supports him – proving that Big Tech is increasingly acting in a nakedly political way.
In an interview with Fox News on Wednesday, Donald Trump declared that ""children are almost immune"" from coronavirus. The videos posted online have been deleted, but the trimmed audio is available here from CNN, which helpfully titled it ""Trump falsely says kids are 'almost immune' from Covid-19,"" just in case its editorial position was in any way in doubt.
In his own inimitable vernacular, Trump says: ""If you look at children, children are almost – and I would almost say definitely – but almost immune from this disease."" He adds, ""I don't know how you feel about it, but they've got much stronger immune systems than we do somehow for this. And they don't have a problem, they just don't have a problem.""
His words may have the cadence of crazed ramblings, but so does everything he says. The question is rather whether or not he's correct.
Fact check!
By this point, the evidence of your own eyes should be enough to pass judgement on this. But here are a few statistics that stand out from the literature. Only a tiny fraction (0.8 percent) of Covid-19 hospital patients have been under the age of 19. Not a single child aged under 10 anywhere in the world has transmitted the virus to another person, despite a global effort from the World Health Organization to find one. And a large meta study across 26 counties found just seven deaths among children that were ascribed to coronavirus.
Bearing those figures in mind, if Trump meant that ""almost all children are immune,"" he was right. Similarly, if he meant children as a whole are ""almost immune"", it would take considerable mental gymnastics to disagree. And this is if the statistics are taken at face value: the 0.8 percent figure is just as exaggerated as all the other figures, due to asymptomatic cases, and the seven deaths is such a small number it is statistically insignificant. Who knows what went on in those seven cases, and how old the patients were. If they were older teens, they could just as easily have been classed as adults.
What are the censors talking about?
In the CNN segment, Trump's comments are responded to by an analyst. He says that what Trump said was a lie, because ""while it's true that children tend to be spared from the more severe consequences of this disease, it's not because they're not getting infected."" He makes a sound point.
But he should reach for his dictionary and look up the word ""immune."" It doesn't mean ""cannot be infected by something"". What nonsense! That would be like saying I'm immune to dengue fever because I've never encountered it. To be immune to a disease actually implies infection – if you're not infected, how could you gain immunity or be shown to be immune? Immunity is the ability to be exposed to a pathogen and not made sick by it, not the ability to physically evade pathogens.
By this man's 'analysis,' if it could be termed such, a human being's immune system should be located outside the body, like a sort of bubble suit that repels pathogens before they can touch the wearer. If Trump thinks this is what immunity means, then he was indeed trying to 'misinform' the American people. But Trump does not think this, because Trump, unlike hordes of his detractors, is not a moron.
Change the record
This is becoming truly boring now. The combined might of the Western world's entirely liberal-controlled social media companies raining constant slime on the lawfully elected American president. At least it cannot go on beyond November. Either Zuck and Jack and co. will get their way and Joe Biden will be elected, or Trump will win again, and they'll have to regroup and go back to the drawing board – probably the one marked 'impeachment.'
Of course, it wouldn't be long before the slime machines would be powered up once more and turned full blast on Trump, but surely there'd only be a short reprieve for the Big Tech establishment before the White House would wreak its revenge. I hope so – for their sake as much as my own.

2020-08-07,Why Was Trump Censored For Saying Children Are 'Almost Immune' From COVID-19? – OpEd,,"Americans in many states areprotestingthe government mandates that require people to ""shelter in place,"" prohibit traveling, and shut down businesses. The issue is being framed as a trade-off between health concerns related to a very contagious virus and the economic costs resulting from the government-mandated shut-down of much of the economy – health versus wealth.
There is another trade-off that seems to be neglected in the discussion: liberty. Even asPresident Trump pushes to try to re-open the economy, the rhetoric is a weighing of the economic costs of government policies versus protecting Americans from the pandemic. As the president said, ""To preserve the health of our citizens, we must also preserve the health and functioning of our economy.""
I'd prefer to see more emphasis put on liberty.
The protesters cited in the article linked in the first paragraph are, essentially, protesting against the government's infringement of their liberty, although they are not phrasing it that way. They want the right to return to their jobs, to leave their homes, and to make their own decisions about how to protect their health. They are protesting government restrictions on their freedom.
These protesters are not a part of an organized group and do not have leaders and spokesmen who are crafting their message, which is why their plea for liberty does not come across clearly. Press coverage tends to focus on immediate goals such as returning to work or being able to spend time with friends and family. But while individuals have many different immediate goals, they all have the same long-run goal of being able to make their own choices, rather than having government mandates restrict what they can do.
People are protesting against government mandates that have compromised their liberty.
I'm not taking a stand on whether the government's policies are warranted in response to a global pandemic. Rather, I'm saying that we have not properly framed the trade-offs. There is more to evaluating those policies than just looking at the health consequences versus the damage being done to the economy. Another cost of those policies is their reduction in liberty, and the protests against government policies reflect that.
Last week,President Trump tweetedsupport for the protesters, saying ""LIBERATE Minnesota,"" followed by ""LIBERATE Michigan,"" and more ominously, ""LIBERATE Virginia, and save your great 2nd Amendment. It is under siege!"" While this falls short of an articulate defense of liberty, I do give the president some credit here for using the language of liberty in support of easing back on government restrictions.
Restrictions on liberty are clearly evident in the short run. The longer-run issue is that once governments have established the power to restrict liberty in this way, there is a tendency for those who have the political power to use the precedent of past government actions to justify similar actions in the future.
Compromises in liberty today make it easier to restrict people's liberty tomorrow. Protesters around the nation are reacting to their loss of liberty and coverage of the protests should be framed that way. Let's recognize these protests for what they are: people protesting against government policies that compromise their liberty.

2020-05-01,"Health, Wealth And Liberty In The COVID-19 Era – OpEd",,"Dec 08, 2020( The People's Vanguard of Davis: http://davisvanguard.org Delivered by Newstex)  (Corey Browning/Special to S.F. Examiner) By Jacob Vito One of San Francisco's most unique and appealing traits has long been its city architecture's eclectic nature. 100-year-old wooden townhouses can live mere blocks away from towering high rises made of glass and steel. But in 2020, many of those diverse living spaces share a common trait: they remain disproportionately empty. 
As many as 89,000 households have moved out of the San Francisco area during the coronavirus pandemic, according to a report from The Guardian[1]. This has led to a near-100 percent spike in open and available homes in the city. A large number of these moves seem to stem from a common cause: a sudden lack of the need to go to the office. With opportunities for remote working expanding and becoming more permanent, many formerly living and working in San Francisco have left in hopes of more affordable housing elsewhere. However, this rapid increase in empty living spaces has only made one of the Bay Area's most persistent problems all the more apparent: homelessness. Estimates from 2019 have shown that the greater San Francisco area is one of the largest hotspots of homelessness in the country, with the city's homeless population alone at over 8,000 people. What's more, the number of homeless in the area has only been rising for the last number of years, with the coronavirus only further growing the demographic. Though the city government implemented a program to move the most vulnerable of San Francisco's homeless to temporary living in hotels, the future of that program remains uncertain moving into 2021. Many of those struggling with homelessness are forced to prepare for a life without stable living conditions once again. Even when looking at such a situation, an important number should come to mind: 1,800 houses are currently open and on the housing market. That means this conversation would not exist by simply using the unoccupied homes for this homelessness crisis and having around four people per dwelling. There are already enough empty living spaces in San Francisco to end the city's homelessness epidemic. Yet during these unprecedented times of empty dwellings, something baffling happened: as noted by the San Francisco Chronicle[2], housing prices rose. In a year where more people have moved out of the Bay Area than ever, such data would be preposterous. Because of this abundance of supply and lack of demand, one conclusion remains: the number of people who want to live there does not decide the housing cost in San Francisco. In truth, many of the most expensive living spaces in San Francisco do not exist for people. Very simply, they are an investment: a way of temporarily storing the wealth that gives the property's owners a slightly favorable tax rate. Any benefit gained by actually having individuals live in such a space is no doubt preferred but often secondary. Ultimately, the math is not that hard. Some empty homes and apartments will likely not be occupied for months or years to come, and some people would have their lives bettered by living in them. It doesn't take a genius to figure out what to do next. However, those who consider the homeless lazy or imagine a shelter as a privilege, not a right, receive pushback. But in truth, what differentiates the two? Americans have many rights: freedom of speech, protection from cruel and unusual, etc. Yet among all the strictly defined rights lies one of the most impactful phrases in the Declaration of Independence: the inalienable right of 'life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.' Does systemic homelessness allow for any of these? In a city where the very concept of shelter has such an inflated cost, can someone truly pursue happiness without access to one of the most important factors in life's stability? To put it bluntly, no. There's a reason that shelter is considered one of the most basic needs. Without it, people are exposed to exponentially more physical and mental harm outside of their control. Many factors leading to homelessness, from debt to addiction to the loss of a job, are often caused by a bad stroke of luck, but bad luck is no real excuse to destroy the foundation of someone's life. What's more, with other public services and utilities, this situation has already been noticed and rectified. A public fire department or mail carrier, or school were all founded on the fact that a country is better for everyone when some basic level of care is given to all its citizens. Emergency services, electricity and water, sanitation and perhaps soon healthcare are all services and protections now guaranteed to practically every American, knowing that doing so makes the standard of living for everyone in this country better. So, to further grow this country into the 21st century, I ask, 'Why not housing next?' The post Student Opinion: As COVID-19 Rises, So Do Unoccupied Homes[3] appeared first on Davis Vanguard[4].

2020-12-08,"Student Opinion: As COVID-19 Rises, So Do Unoccupied Homes",,"Jan 06, 2021( Ventureburn: http://ventureburn.com Delivered by Newstex)  In the ongoing battle to control and contain COVID-19 across the world, it's become clear just how crucial digital technology is to ensuring success globally. There are already early indications that digital innovation is pivotal to pave the road to COVID-19 recovery, particularly in countries with less developed digital applications  The healthcare industry has been forced to revolutionise digital practices to enable the strategic collection of patient data, safe practices between providers and the public, and disbursing the necessary supplies to vulnerable communities. Here are just a few examples of how digital innovation could be the key to recovery from the global pandemic:International remittance paymentsEarly data has shown that COVID-19 may have been the stimulus forrapid digital innovation in global remittance payments[1], with more people turning to digital money transfers for lower fees to send money home. 
It's possible that as the world adapts to life with COVID-19, digital innovation will be key to ensuring vulnerable communities can continue to remain protected and supported from vital international payments. Global remittances are crucial to vulnerable countries during a crisis, and the need for digital innovation is absolutely essential when it comes to financial services. For many countries, remittance payments are funding needs such as medicine, supplies, and family support - the loss of such payments due to economic crisis or simply being unable to send money abroad could have major implications. For example, in 2018 Kenya received an amount roughly the equivalent of0.8% of its GDP[2]from the UK alone in remittances. A significant drop in remittance payments in 2020 could dramatically change the global economic landscape and leave thousands of households dependent on global remittances in vulnerable positions when in the midst of a global pandemic.Track and trace appsThe need for artificial intelligence (AI) has become abundantly clear as the necessity for accurate tracking and tracing capabilities to track and prevent the spread of COVID-19 globally grows. Already, digital innovations have enabled tracing without the need for reliance on individuals: acontact tracing app[3]in South Africa uses location settings to track and trace people believed to have come into contact with the virus, while elsewhere, developers inSweden[4]have created an app to track the real-time status of patient volumes, PPE, and ventilator usage. It's worth noting, however, that AI does still have its limitations. Privacy laws in many countries make tracking the movements of citizens difficult, whilst the success of many track and trace apps rely on the likelihood of smartphone users having their phone with them at all times when in public to accurately track location movements.Virtualized HealthcareDigital healthcare may not have been a major concern prior to the global pandemic, but it's certainly a priority now. In the healthcare industry, video conferencing may become a vital part of communication between staff and patients to prevent new cases by minimizing physical contact as much as possible. While many countries are rapidly developing virtualisation treatment practices (known as telemedicine),some reports suggest[5]that African healthcare providers are yet to join the rush for development. What is clear, however, is that digital healthcare technologies need to innovate rapidly in order to limit physical interactions between patients and healthcare providers in the fight against COVID-19.Internet of Things (IOT)The Internet of Things (IoT) is the interconnection of computing devices to allow for the automated transference and real-time capture of data. While IoT has already undergone major digital innovations in sectors such as consumer electronics, it's applications formanaging COVID-19 are expansive[6]. Tracking devices, for example, could become a key component of reducing the spread of COVID-19 via IoT devices that can transfer patient data on temperature, heart rate, and blood pressure to healthcare providers. Likewise, innovations in IoT devices could also be used to enforce quarantine and social distancing rules amongst individuals, tracking the GPS signals of patients to ensure they do not breach quarantine. The road to recovery from COVID-19 lies with major digital innovations in the healthcare industry, and already, it's clear that adapting to life under a global pandemic has led to rapid changes to the technology currently being used to better equip healthcare professionals and protect the public from the spread of coronavirus. What remains to be seen is how the need for data can be balanced with the necessary protection of citizen's privacy and personal-care - while digital advancements may be key for mitigating the COVID-19 spread, regulation needs to run parallel to these developments.

2021-01-06,Digital innovation: The Covid-19 road to recovery [Opinion],,"The University College London issued the following commentary by Pro-Vice-Provost Paul Ayris:
* * *
UCL's COVID-19 Research platform reached a landmark moment this August as it recorded its 500th entry. Dr Paul Ayris, Pro-Vice-Provost (UCL Library Services), explains why making research available and open to the world will benefit us all.
At UCL, we have been applying the depth and breadth of our cross-disciplinary research and expertise to help the global effort in combatting COVID-19 and to make the world more resilient and equitable in the future.
One of the specific ways we have supported interventions against COVID-19 has been through making our research and data freely available around the world. UCL has a long-term commitment to innovative Open Science principles as we recognise the wider benefits for advancing knowledge and discoveries.
Determined to apply the Open Science ethos in the challenge to understand COVID-19, we were one of the first universities anywhere in the world to develop an online platform bringing together all our records for research on the pandemic into one place.
The UCL COVID-19 Research platform is managed on behalf of the UCL community by UCL Press, the UK's first fully Open Access University Press. The platform brings together records for published articles, pre-prints, working papers and reports from a global database maintained by ScienceOpen, which expands by more than one million records every month.
The platform uses metadata (catalogue descriptions) to pull in research from a range of outlets from traditional commercial journals to pre-print servers. Where the research is Open Access, the platform makes the full-text of the publication available.
This month (August), UCL's COVID-19 Research platform reached a landmark moment with 500 pieces of research recorded, and over 13,000 views to the platform.
The COVID-19 Research platform is a hugely important initiative in the context of the current pandemic. The sharing of research insights and information is crucial to enabling a global response to the current crisis.
We know this having learned lessons in previous pandemics. For example, later analysis of the Ebola crisis, that affected thousands of people particularly in Western Africa, showed that the sharing of research, data and information was poor. There was no central record of research findings, and many collections of research data were inaccessible.
These barriers to rapid information sharing affected the ways in which the virus was managed, controlled and treated.
UCL is determined that the same failures do not happen during the COVID-19 pandemic. We outlined our commitment in a statement on the importance of Open Science, published earlier this month.
UCL's COVID-19 Research platform is one of our gifts to the world, sharing our knowledge and wisdom across the globe for the benefit of all.

2020-08-21,University College London: Opinion - Making COVID-19 Research Open to All,,"The COVID-19 crisis could be a shift point in the Canberra view that effective government in Australia requires the inexorable takeover, even by stealth, of state responsibilities by the Commonwealth. 

The trend since federation has been centralisation and the steady diminution of the states at the expense of the power and prestige of the Commonwealth. Think centralisation of income tax in the second world war. Centralisation of a broadening range of social services from the 1970s onwards. Centralisation of instruments, rules and institutions in economic domains like competition, workplace relations and environment protection. Indeed, the global financial crisis reinforced the view in Canberra that it is national instruments and approaches that matter. 

The COVID crisis rebuts the view that federation is a one-way street to the centre. The crisis has made clear that the states own the primary legal instruments and tools of enforcement for law and order, public safety, hospitals and schools. To date, the exercise of these responsibilities by the states has worked. The Commonwealth has in turn used its instruments well - notably its control of the nation's border, its active and targeted use of the national budget and balance sheet, a national central bank that can buy government bonds, and its national convening authority through the creation of national cabinet. The combined responses of the Commonwealth and states have been complementary and mutually reinforcing. They have revealed a functioning federation. 

Before we get too carried away, we should recognise that the federated response might not have worked. Outcomes are not deterministic. For example, if individual states had sought to replicate the New Zealand approach and separately define and enforce their own narrow lists of essential activities, then the risk of a break down in national supply chains of food and key items across the federation could have been much greater. Had this risk materialised, then the states could have been seen as undermining the national interest in a pandemic. The national cabinet has moderated unilateral action by states because the crisis has revealed the deep interdependencies in people's lives and livelihoods between states. The national cabinet, too, has moderated unilateral action by the Commonwealth because it has shown the limits of Commonwealth power and knowledge. More generally, the national cabinet provided a political foil to intense public pressure on each jurisdiction to ramp up action and prove it was doing everything it possibly could. Of course, the response has to continue to work as contact controls are eased. 

This new sense that the federation can work presents the national cabinet with a remarkable opportunity for better government and public administration, particularly in the quality of services provided to the Australian people. The debate about COVID-induced reform has been dominated by tax and market reform. Service delivery by governments should also be on the agenda. 

It is a serious weakness of our system that Australians largely have to navigate for themselves the complexities of Commonwealth and state public administrations to get the services that their governments provide. Sadly, there are a lot more people doing that now. If governments can work together in the national interest, as the national cabinet shows they can, then why not take the ambitious big step to fully integrate the services they provide to individuals. There is a long history of work to improve service delivery across all jurisdictions and, in recent years, NSW has led the way in integrating state government services, first with Services NSW and then the creation of a Department of Customer Service. The Commonwealth has sought more integration of Commonwealth human services with Services Australia. But collectively it still falls short. The national cabinet has the opportunity to set an objective for fully integrated service delivery for the people of Australia across government by 2030 or even 2025, with trials, steps and increments to that objective. 

Services can be delivered digitally, in call centres and through person to person contact - and all are important to meet the circumstances of individuals. There is huge promise in digital technology and data analytics to integrate and improve some human services. Indeed, COVID-19 has shown that some services thought to require personal contact can be delivered digitally, at least partially, with remarkable stories of innovation by public servants in health, communities and justice. Widespread, integrated and flexible digital service delivery would require significant and strategic investment by the Commonwealth as well as the states. The Commonwealth, for example, could fund digital transformation by reprioritising existing spending on the public sector (radically simplifying hierarchy and process and reducing duplication with the states), supported by changes to its bureaucratic structures that drive genuine and broad-based transformation.","EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (99%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); NEGATIVE NEWS (90%); CABINET OFFICES (89%); CREDIT CRISIS (78%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); ESSENTIAL BUSINESSES & WORKERS (78%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (78%); GOVERNMENT BUDGETS (78%); PUBLIC FINANCE (78%); SAFETY (78%); BONDS (73%); SAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (73%); LABOR & EMPLOYMENT (70%); WORLD WAR II (56%); CENTRAL BANKS (51%); GOVERNMENT BONDS (51%)

This, as the firm manages critical industries such as power, banking and financial services, food, land, and infrastructure, including cement manufacturing and construction.
Sabin Aboitiz, company president and chief executive officer, shared the commitment to keep its businesses running smoothly to help the country's economy to weather the challenges posed by the health crisis.
Aboitiz said his team regularly inspects current operations at AP Renewables, Inc. Makiling-Banahaw (MakBan) Geothermal Power Plant, and its other businesses to check on the working conditions of the team members and front-line workers.
Aboitiz is committed to provide unhampered delivery of products and services across critical sectors that will help keep our economy moving, he said in a statement on Tuesday.
The group will continue to provide reliable and ample power supply to the country; ensure food security along with our partners; continue to create better ways to live; and ensure enough and domestically-produced cement of good quality to support the country's infrastructure initiatives, he added.
In all these visits, Aboitiz said these facilities are carefully following strict pre-entry safety requirements, health screening, and other safety protocols.
On top of keeping unhampered operations on various work sites and business facilities, the most important thing is ensuring that our team members especially those in the frontlines, those who are keeping the lights on; those who are keeping the machines running; and those who are building our homes one brick at a time are well taken-cared of; that they are healthy, safe and their needs are met, Aboitiz said.
To ensure a safe working environment, Republic Cement Batangas plant manager Erwin Cruz said strict pre-entry screening requirements and health protocols greet guests and visitors in all Aboitiz business sites, including temperature check, proper hand hygiene, wearing of masks and physical distancing.
Upon entry, both employees and visitors are met with constant reminders on physical distancing, frequent hand sanitation, proper wearing of masks, and personal protective equipment on site.
Meanwhile, at the Seafront Residences, Aboitiz inspected completed houses and amenities as well as future areas for development.
The AboitizLand, through its assistant vice president for customer management, Monica Trajano, was able to highlight its successes and initiatives towards meeting the construction goals despite the challenges brought about by the pandemic.

2022-01-21,"Sen. Johnson To Hold Panel Discussion, COVID-19: A Second Opinion",,"In the COVID era, it's time to look at housing from a different angle so we can help shape a better future for all
The COVID-19 pandemic has highlighted housing inequities and put the global housing crisis back on the radar. With a spotlight on housing's role in public health - particularly in urban areas - predictions abound in the media about the future of housing and cities.
Yet, these predictions are usually written by financially secure individuals and tend to ignore the plight of the world's poor, for whom housing progress has been notoriously slow.
In the COVID era, it's time to look at housing from a different angle so we can help shape a better future for all. Here are four housing facts that the poor have learned - the hard way:
1. In poorer communities, staying home can increase rather than lower contagion risks.
""Stay home - Save lives!"" was the order, as countries around the globe scrambled to block the spread of the COVID-19 virus. Businesses responded by permitting employees to work from home. And, by and large, the strategy has worked - in wealthy countries, at least. In the developing world and poorer neighborhoods, however, it poses a greater risk of illness and death, for low-income families living in crowded conditions. Research has indicated that 90% of households in the developing world cannot fully comply with one or several of the WHO recommendations for defending against the virus - due to inadequate space, poor ventilation, and poor access to water and sanitation. In response, from Singapore to Chile, housing authorities are designing emergency programs to eradicate overcrowding and improve sanitary conditions.
2. The lack of clean water and toilet facilities is also a deadly - and persistent - problem for the urban poor.
According to UN Water, 700 million urbanites live without proper sanitation, while 156 million live without adequate access to water. A recent study conducted by the World Bank's Global Program for Resilient Housing found that in three capital cities in Latin America, almost as many households could not access clean water and sanitation (15.1%) as suffered from overcrowding (17.3%). Simple, concrete actions could save lives-such as granting subsidies, prepaid facilities for connecting homes to these services, or emergency guarantees to avoid disconnections when families lose their jobs and fail to pay their utility bills.
3. Stay-at-home orders only work if families can earn from home.
Predictions have proliferated in architectural publications about housing designs that will accommodate our new need to work remotely from home - moving walls, adding more balconies, improving sound insulation. U.S. developers have already started to think about how to implement these changes in new buildings in cost-effective ways. Yet, even in a pandemic, poor families most often have to leave their homes to make money. These new designs don't target the poor, but wealthier households who may continue to work from home in the long term. In fact, most households around the world could benefit from simpler, affordable upgrades that would make their homes function as workplaces as well as safe shelters: water connections, an additional room, better ventilation, internet access, and maybe a small shop where they can sell their goods or services.
4. Relocation is harder for the poor.
From the United States to Russia and Bangladesh, the media has focused on the ""exodus"" from cities to the suburbs, as urban living became more dangerous and work-from-home policies more widespread. A big question mark hangs over the future of commercial real estate in cities all over the world, as it seems doubtful whether workers will ever return to offices full-time. But writing the obituary for densely populated cities is premature. In fact, urban life has survived deadly viruses since the birth of large cities in the ancient world; and data in the United States also seems hopeful. Though research confirms that housing prices have risen in the New York suburbs while decreasing in Manhattan, according to the real estate site Zillow, this trend has not occurred in most U.S. urban areas, where home sales remain strong due to historically low interest rates. In India, migrant workers are already returning to cities from villages despite the continued thread of the virus.
The global trend towards urbanization is likely to survive the pandemic. Cities are likely to remain the engines of economic growth and innovation. Yes, our cities are now struggling to tackle unforeseen challenges; but in the process, they're also reinventing themselves on the fly. Greater access to green spaces, more cafes in the streets instead of cars, improvements in public health, and new protections against evictions and utility cut-offs - these are among a plethora of urban interventions appearing around the world.
Housing policies, too, will have to change. Now is a good time for governments to redouble their attention on the future of cities and resilient housing, and to commit to making the lives of urban dwellers healthier and more equitable.

2020-09-23,Opinion - the Future of Urban Housing After Covid-19 [opinion],,"We are in 7/24 lockdown at home these days, we have no other topic to talk about except Covid-19. All media news speaks only of Covid-19. Although global wrong policies are implemented, late and incomplete decisions are made and negative comments are made, we are experiencing formations that coincidentally correspond to the expected curve. Covid-19 sets new global rules of the pandemic everywhere, pushing decision-makers in the direction it should be.
The hard power of the new generation F35s, S400s and large aircraft carriers are no longer necessary. Payments were postponed for construction tenders, highways, bridges, due to fear of the epidemic. Limited resources were quickly directed to city hospitals, construction of half-hospital buildings were accelerated. Gigantic City Hospitals of Istanbul Başakşehir in European side were rapidly opened, similarly Başıbüyük on the Anatolian side of Istanbul. Arçelik Aselsan METU accelerated ICU intensive care units mass production. The health personnel needed by the new hospitals have been taken from the young staff of the old hospitals, family physicians and provincial physicians have been assigned to these new city hospitals.
All resources have been provided for the construction and completion of Ankara Etlik City hospital. With the repetitive curfew on the weekends, the rate of infection spread was cut. The herd immunity advantage of the young population came into play.
All Turkish borders were closed. The widespread epidemic in the southern immigrant camps forced Syrian immigrants to return to their motherland. The USA's unpreparedness to the pandemic is shaking the whole globe. When Britain's Prime Minister Boris Johnson was quarantined, his post remained to Rishi Altar, an Indian-born well-educated treasury minister with Indian origin.
In Russia, Vladimir Putin has just understood the seriousness of the situation. Covid-19 pandemic even defeated the unbreakable stubbornness of the Vatican and other religious institutions. Churches, mosques are closed to religious sermons. Saudis authorities canceled all hajj programs this year. They don't take anyone into sacred places. Because of the need of female medical personnel, they removed the necessity of covered hoods.
Angela Merkel in Germany brought the epidemic in Germany under control with her academic sensitivity. The number of casualties in Germany is kept at minimum. German authorities took the outbreak forecast report of the 2012 Robert Koch Institute seriously and applied the necessary preventive measures and investments. So current causalities are less than other countries. Germany, which makes the necessary investments in health issues and has high-number of ICU devices ready, is considered to be saved.
However Germany has loosened the epidemic rules a little nowadays, due to unskilled worker requirement of their economy. They invited east European young healthy workers of 100 thousand to enter Germany. These are young people with better life expectancy who are not afraid of the epidemic, most will work in unskilled jobs in agricultural lands outdoors or in health centers. The average age in Germany is 49, and there are no young people do heavy work. Most German people work on computers in office work. Nowadays they all work from home without going to the office.
Global oil prices have fallen in the world, there is ample nonstop production, but there is no demand. There is no extra place to store oil production. The producers have started to give money to the buyer in order to store. Moreover big price discounts are expected soon for natural gas prices which are indexed to oil prices.
Coal can no longer be extracted from underground mines. It's hard after #Covid-19 pandemic. Thermal power plants will remain idle and in the end they all be closed in time. Renewables wind, solar, hydro resources will gain importance. After Covid-19, we will return to fully renewable energy sources. New investments will quickly flow to renewables.
Europeans canceled their summer holiday reservations, early booking reimbursements led hotel and aircraft companies to bankruptcy. Restaurants, cafes, bars, all closed entertainment spaces will need a long time to reopen. Nobody will go there for a long time, even after reopening. The airplanes are used only for emergency evacuation and healthcare transportation. Intercity passenger transportation is over, only food trucks work on highways. This epidemic will last at least 2-3 years with repeated mutations, eventually the world will be completely different and we will acquire new habits that are accustomed to living indoors.
The Covid-19 outbreak process continues. We finished the fourth week of being lockdown at home in Ankara. There are optimistic political statements, but realistic academic interpretations say that this process will continue to slow until the end of June and still will continue for 1-2 years, with new waves that have mutated next year, even if it eases. The Spanish flu, in 1918, continued with more mutations in the years 1919-1920.
Closing our borders was a very important decision. Especially Iran, Iraq and Syria borders were very important in terms of stopping the epidemic. The entrance of people infected through Iran and the Middle East was very dangerous.
On the other hand, we hear that the epidemic has increased in Russia, Bulgaria, Greece and Georgia.
The existence of the outbreak is unlike the power of any combat weapon. In the epidemic of Covid-19, America's heavy new modern weapon power meant no sense. Italy, Spain, England are not good at all. It will take time for them to survive.
There are 4000 soldiers on the American USS Roosevelt aircraft carrier, located near the Pacific island of Guam, almost as high as 500 soldiers test positive with the Covid-19 epidemic.
The huge aircraft carrie warship almost failed to work. Likewise, in the French DeGaulle aircraft carrier in the Mediterranean, 1000 out of 1700 soldiers are now sick. If the fighter plane pilots get sick, if marines get sick, if food soldiers get sick, who remains to fight any conventional war?
None of the new generation F35 fighter aircraft, new S400 or patriot missiles, or aircraft carriers have any significance. Luxury cars, private planes, luxury villas have no meaning at all. All countries have been defeated by Covid-19 virus without using any weapons, all streets are empty.
A year from now, do not expect the people would have forgotten all of this and went back to their old ways easily. If anything, the best we hope the virus showed the Millennial and the Gen-X and Gen-x the flaws of our society. In the West; the new generations, if they are awoken now; should start paying closer attention to the politics instead of concentrating on the tech revolution. Otherwise, the monies US FED printed in 2001 (9/11) and the in 2008 (financial crisis) and now in 2020 (virus) will haunt them for their whole life.During Covid-19 pandemic process, it is useful to reconsider public policies that are paralyzed in the current global environment.
After Covid-19, we have to redraw new world order. The world after Covid-19 will be another new type new order that we cannot anticipate now.

2020-04-23,How Will The World Be After #COVID-19? – OpEd,,"In recent weeks, countries around the world, especially in Europe, have begun to ease what were some of the most stringent lockdown measures imposed in response to COVID-19. The collective efforts of many citizens, not only in these countries, has at last begun to bear fruit. Although there is a long way to go, it is incredible to see how individuals and companies have taken collective responsibility to support those in need at a time of genuine crisis. The question remains, is this a temporary shift by societies towards collective good because it is in our interests to do so, or a wholesale realignment as to what defines our social purpose.
Reasons to be hopeful
Throughout the crisis, we have witnessed various inspiring acts of humanity. Healthcare workers across the world have put their lives at risk to save ours. In the UK, a country in which I have spent a lot of time and studied, over 750,000 people voluntarily signed up to help the National Health Service to support the clinically vulnerable. Though vaccine development is an intense process, there are now reportedly around 80 groups around the world working to find a vaccine, with some efforts already entering clinical trials.
The pandemic has also ignited a debate about work-life balance, the necessity of travel, whether we need to be in an office, and what is genuinely important to us. It has never been more important to stay connected with friends, family, and our local communities. COVID-19 is indiscriminate in who it affects and therefore should highlight to all the importance of abiding by social distancing guidelines, not just for our benefit, but to save lives.
Additionally, while the world has been locked down the planet has begun to heal from the onset of climate change. Emissions at a national level are down 26% on average. Could a global health pandemic actually turn out to be the catalyst for real climate emergency change – an issue that doesn't affect millions, but billions. Despite the challenges we face, there are reasons to be hopeful.
The importance of individual responsibility
Because of the necessity for us all to do our part, there is an increased focus on individual actions and how they impact society collectively. The easing of lockdown restrictions has only been possible due to the discipline of the vast majority of the general public. Yet if individuals decide to ignore scientific and government guidance, then the gains that have been hard-fought will be quickly lost - and more people will die. Instead of perceiving guidelines as restrictive, we should change our perspective and understand that adherence to lockdown measures are an essential part of being a responsible and caring citizen. The more we adhere to the rules, the quicker that life will return to normality. Accordingly, wear a mask, give way to others, maintain social distance, be aware of one's hygiene, wash your hands – even queue. As pointed out in a recent article in The Lancet, the response of individuals to advice on mitigating COVID-19 will be as important, if not more so than government action.
As restrictions ease globally, we must not forget our civic responsibility and patriotic duty to protect and save lives. How successful we are will depend on the simplest of deeds as outlined above. If that also means refraining from seeing our elderly relatives, despite how much we may want to see them, , so be it. We may remain physically distant, but emotionally we should endeavour to be more connected than ever before.
Coming together after COVID-19
One of the key takeaways from COVID-19 is the realisation that globally we are more connected than we realized. An event that occurs in a far-off distant location has the potential to impact us all. Recently, countries have demonstrated a desire to withdraw from the global world order to suit their own nationalist agendas. And yet the irony of COVID-19 is that each one of our actions has the potential to impact another. We are more reliant on each other then we may have believed. Countries have joined forces to tackle the global shortage of Personal Protective Equipment, the pooling of resources to find a vaccine, or simply coordinated repatriation efforts to return citizens home. In this spirit, I am glad Gilan Holding has continued to play a small part in this collective effort by recently opening a new facility in Sumgayit in Azerbaijan that will create over 250 jobs, and produce 300,000 protective masks and 6,000 overalls per day.
The best way to defeat this virus is to adhere to scientific advice and public health guidelines, and by educating our children on why it is our collective and civic duty to help those in need. We must work as partners with not only people from across our societies but globally. Only through collaboration will we defeat COVID-19. Although we are temporarily apart, COVID-19 has the potential to bring humanity closer together and to help engender a new spirit of global cooperation and collaboration.

2020-06-01,Collective Responsibility In The COVID-19 Era – OpEd,,"WASHINGTON, May 1 -- The U.S. Department of Defense issued the following news release:
Two Navy hospital ships deployed to New York and Los Angeles to aid in fighting the pandemic are winding down operations, Jonathan Rath Hoffman, assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs, said today.
The USNS Comfort left New York harbor for its home port in Norfolk today. The USNS Mercy in Los Angeles has stopped accepting new patients.
""These are both welcome signs that the American public is following CDC guidelines and the number of COVID-19 cases are decreasing,"" Hoffman said. ""Local hospital capacity in these two areas have been sufficient to meet the demand.""
This does not mean that DOD personnel are out of the fight against coronavirus, though. In New York - the hardest hit area in the country - there are almost 700 uniformed doctors and nurses deployed in hospitals in the city and surrounding areas, Hoffman said.
But the DOD has worldwide missions, responsibilities and interests, and the Pentagon spokesman highlighted some of them.
He announced that British Royal Navy Commodore James Parkin turned over command of the International Maritime Security Construct in Manama, Bahrain to British Royal Navy Commodore Rob Bellfield in a virtual ceremony. The construct is meant to secure the vitally important Arabian Gulf region from malign actions. A total of eight nations participate in the construct and Parkin said he expects more to join.
He also noted that yesterday the U.S. Transportation Command awarded a $7.2 billion global household goods contract to the American Roll-on, Roll-off Carrier Group of New Jersey. The contract is for relocating service members and their families.
Hoffman also announced that two Navy ships - the USS Barry and USS Bunker Hill - conducted freedom of navigation operations this week in the South China Sea. The ships ""started and ended a full transit at a time and place of our choosing, as we always do,"" he said. ""The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate to challenge excessive maritime claims in order to preserve the rights, freedoms and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations under international law.""
Finally, he announced that DOD representatives will testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee next week on the Federal Communications Commission decision to award Ligado Networks to deploy a 5G system that could disrupt the Global Positioning System. Dana Deasy, DOD's chief information officer; Michael Griffin, undersecretary of defense for research and engineering; and Space Force Gen. John Raymond, the chief of space operations and commander of U.S. Space Command, will testify before the panel.

2020-05-01,"DOD SPOKESMAN BRIEFS ON COVID-19 OPS, BAHRAIN COMMAND, 5G PROBLEMS",,"I work in early childhood education, and the past few months have been a particularly scary time for us for a variety of reasons. Not only do we work with an age group prone to sneezing and drooling on us when we know coronavirus can easily be transmitted these ways, but the government has barely helped any of us financially, if at all. Also on that list is parent behavior.
Barely over a month ago, as we hit 1,500 cases of coronavirus a day, the government was talking about the need for a lockdown. Now as we barely get back down to that same number, our self-serving government has decided this is somehow safe enough to send our kids back to preschool. To avoid another surge that makes a third lockdown inevitable, it is vital that parents do more to help this time around.
 As preschools are set to reopen, the government has changed virtually none of the restrictions for these age groups since the last two times we've returned to school. But hey, maybe third time is a charm? The only chance we have is if parents step up.
It's clear from the given restrictions that the government is unaware of the type of parent behavior with which many of us have been dealing. It is unfair that the onus is entirely on kindergartens to follow restrictions. For many of us, even when we followed Health Ministry guidelines to the letter in September, we still had parents bring coronavirus into our ganim within the first week.
Teachers are already in charge of large groups of young children. There is no justification for doubling the amount of people they are in charge of, because most parents need to be reminded at every single drop-off and pick-up to wear a mask and follow the restrictions they have been repeatedly been

2020-10-21,Parents must help early childhood educators amid COVID-19 - opinion,,"NEW YORK CITY (dpa-AFX) - Pfizer Inc. (PFE) and BioNTech SE (BNTX) said that a 30-microgram booster dose of their Omicron BA.4/BA.5 bivalent-adapted COVID-19 Vaccine has been recommended for conditional marketing authorization by the European Medicines Agency's (EMA) Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) for individuals ages 12 years and older.  The European Commission will review the CHMP recommendation and is expected to make a final decision soon.  The Omicron BA.4/BA.5-adapted bivalent vaccine contains 15- microgram of mRNA encoding the wild-type spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 in the Original Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, and 15- microgram of mRNA encoding the spike protein of the Omicron BA.4/BA.5 subvariants. Apart from the addition of the mRNA sequence of the BA.4/BA.5 spike protein, all other components of the vaccine remain unchanged.  If an authorization is granted, the Pfizer-BioNTech bivalent Omicron BA.4/BA.5 COVID-19 vaccine will be available within the coming days to all 27 EU member states supporting the European vaccination campaigns. Local supply may vary based on individual country government requests.   In early September, Pfizer and BioNTech were granted a conditional marketing authorization for an Omicron BA.1-adapted bivalent COVID-19 vaccine in the EU. An Omicron-adapted vaccine based on the BA.4/BA.5 subvariant was also authorized by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration as a booster for ages 12 and older on August 31, 2022.  The companies noted that they are also planning to file the data with other regulatory authorities in the coming weeks and are planning to submit data to the FDA and the EMA to prepare an application for an Omicron-adapted bivalent vaccine in children younger than 12 years of age.

Brown/Agence France-Presse   Getty Images By Michelle Moreno Lira This year, Halloween will look different for anyone who enjoys partaking in its festivities. While some experts recommend not participating in the traditional way, people are still encouraged to enjoy non-contact activities. As is the norm, many look forward to Halloween as a day to dress up and go out trick-or-treating with friends or family. Children have lost in-person classes this year and have missed out on many school activities they'd hoped for. The cases of COVID-19 are not at the levels the CDC hopes to have. Recently, this year they're announcing non-contact guidelines that Halloween participants should follow to avoid spreading the virus even further. These guidelines are the best option for those who hope to enjoy this day in safety and security, especially alongside their families. Many believe Halloween will not be the same as in other years, but people will still have the opportunity to participate in activities while keeping outside contact limited. Opting out of traditional Halloween activities will be beneficial for everyone, especially since many people have already lost their businesses and jobs due to https://visitor.r20.constantcontact.com/d.jsp?llr=dfdf98babp=oim=1101518769315sit=99enzcbcbf=64669ab4-a397-4800-9775-08e36bfe25c9COVID-19 closures. 
Traditional Halloween celebrations aren't worth the risk of cases rising and affecting more people's lives. Earlier at the beginning of September, the LA County Public health officials[1] prohibited any sort of festivities for Halloween, and according to the LA Times[2], they decided not to recommend certain activities, such as trick-or-treating or parties. Many people expressed their disdain towards these restrictions and argued that since it was already an outside activity, they believed socially distant trick-or-treating is acceptable and should be allowed. While I agree that trick-or-treating could provide some normality for anyone participating, it is not wise to risk so many lives based on the need to feel normal again and spread the virus further. Anyone who chooses to pass out candy to the public is putting themselves in danger, leaving many other candy goers vulnerable, without acknowledging it. There's no certainty that trick-or-treaters will enforce social distancing themselves or for that matter, respect non-contact trick-or-treating guidelines. Some guidelines set by the CDC[3] include three types of low-risk level activities to choose from this year. One of the lower and moderate risk activities include, 'a Halloween movie night with people you live with' and other activities where people are 'distanced more than six feet apart,' like virtual parties. These rules allow people to participate in indoor celebrations or events held in smaller groups with safe social distancing. Although these recommendations are set, there's no guarantee that people will wear face masks and keep six feet apart. The risks still stand for anyone who chooses to have gatherings (parties) or non-traditional trick-or-treating, where candy bowls are set outside for people to grab. The risk of contracting the virus is not one that people should take lightly, since COVID-19 cases are spiraling upward as many people are continually affected by it. While some opposed these guidelines, many doctors, interviewed by the New York Times[4], agree that non-contact festivities are safer than going outside and celebrating the traditional way. Dr. Tista Ghosh argued that the CDC[5] rules were 'middle of the road' as a 'balance [between] science with personal freedom.' Although it is up to personal freedom to participate, the choices of others will still affect the public at large. The risk stands for anyone who unknowingly catches the virus and spreads it to multiple, if not hundreds, of people. Yolo County[6] has issued its own guidelines, following the CDC's rules, and also provided different level-risk activities. Residents can decide if they want to participate or opt-out. Opting out of in-contact and high-risk festivities doesn't mean you can't celebrate Halloween. People can still participate on their own or maintain six feet apart, while wearing facial coverings, in small groups.Support our work - to become a sustaining at $5 - $10- $25 per month hit the link: https://davisvanguard.networkforgood.com/ The post Student Opinion: Halloween Festivities During COVID-19[7] appeared first on Davis Vanguard[8].

2020-10-12,Student Opinion: Halloween Festivities During COVID-19,,"TAMPA, Fla., May 13 -- The University of South Florida issued the following news:
The University of South Florida and Nielsen today announced the results of a statewide survey of Floridians to assess public opinion related to the COVID-19 pandemic.
Among the findings of the USF-Nielsen Sunshine State Survey on COVID-19 governance and policies:
PUBLIC CONCERN REMAINS HIGH. A majority agree with a statement that they are personally concerned (52.2%) or are concerned about someone they know (76.6%) contracting the novel coronavirus in the next three months.
PUBLIC CONCERNS ARE JUSTIFIED, BUT WORRIES REMAIN ABOUT RESPONSE. While a near universal number of respondents (86.5%) agree that public concern related to the coronavirus is justified, worries also persist about the public reaction. Four in 10 individuals surveyed agree that public reactions to the pandemic will do more harm than the disease itself.
STRONG SUPPORT FOR STATEWIDE MITIGATION POLICIES, INCLUDING FACE MASK REQUIREMENTS. Healthy majorities of individuals surveyed report support for the state closing restaurants and bars (88.9%), limiting public gatherings (94.3%), limiting gatherings in houses of worship (87.4%), issuing ""stay at home"" orders (86.2%), closing beaches and other public recreation areas (81.6%), fining individuals who violate ""stay at home"" orders (62.2%), instituting nightly curfews (62.9%) and requiring individuals to wear masks in public places (79.3%).
STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GAIN MORE APPROVAL AND TRUST THAN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE. A plurality of Floridians (48.9%) approve of the federal government's response to the coronavirus pandemic. Approval of the federal response is 2.5% lower than state government and 20% lower than local government. A majority of individuals surveyed (54.9%) also trust the federal government ""a great deal"" or a ""good amount"" to provide accurate information about the pandemic. Trust in federal information is 8.3% lower than that for state government, and 21.7% lower than that for local government.
MAJORITY APPROVE OF AND TRUST THE STATE GOVERNMENT'S RESPONSE. A majority of Floridians (51.5%) approve of state government's response to the coronavirus pandemic. Almost two-thirds of individuals surveyed (63.1%) also trust state government ""a great deal"" or a ""good amount"" to provide accurate information about the novel coronavirus situation.
ROBUST APPROVAL AND TRUST IN LOCAL GOVERNMENT RESPONSE. Nearly seven in 10 Floridians surveyed (68.8%) approve of their local government's response to the coronavirus pandemic. Greater than three-quarters of Floridians (76.6%) also trust their local government ""a great deal"" or a ""good amount"" to provide accurate information about the novel coronavirus situation.
PARTISAN DIFFERENCES EMERGE ON TRUST AND APPROVAL. Registered Democrats are significantly more likely to disapprove (52%) of the federal response to the COVID-19 situation, compared with 10% of Republicans and 35% of Independents/Third Party identifiers. Similarly, 44% of Democrats disapproved of the state government's response, compared with 11% of Republicans and 32% of Independents/Third Party identifiers.
THE PRESIDENT'S AND GOVERNOR'S PRESS CONFERENCES MATTER. Two-thirds of Floridians (66.3%) say the president's daily press conferences in April were a source of ""a lot"" or ""some"" information about the novel coronavirus situation. Greater than six in 10 Floridians (61.4%) report the same about the governor's daily press conferences in April.
The survey of 600 Floridians was fielded April 15-24, 2020, and the results are reported with a confidence level of 95% and a margin of error +/-4. Full survey results are available here (https://www.usf.edu/arts-sciences/documents/sunshine-state-survey/covid-governance-policies-report.pdf).
USF and Nielsen intend to release a second set of survey data next week focused on economic, consumer and work effects of COVID-19.

2020-05-13,UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH FLORIDA-NIELSEN SURVEY MEASURES PUBLIC OPINION ON COVID-19 RESPONSE,,"By Faisal J. Abbas*
The extraordinary ""virtual"" G20 summit hosted by Saudi Arabia on Thursday will probably be the most significant since the group was founded in 1999. It is no exaggeration to say that all hope is pinned on the leaders of the world's biggest economies agreeing on a way to confront the biggest threat to our future — the novel coronavirus and the disease it causes, COVID-19.
The virus has infected nearly half-a-million people worldwide and killed more than 20,000, and those are only the officially reported cases that we know about. Stock markets from Tokyo to Wall Street have fallen. Airline fleets are grounded. Billions of people have been forced to stop work and stay at home. It is now evident that this virus is pitting humanity against a ""perfect storm"" — a hurricane in the form of disease that could afflict millions and kill hundreds of thousands, and an economic tsunami that could engulf whole countries, destroy infrastructure and hamper recovery for years to come.
This is why Saudi Arabia's presidency of the G20 gives Riyadh enormous responsibility — not just because it is the host country, but because the Kingdom is uniquely well placed to bring diverse forces closer together in a more effective stand against the coronavirus.
Not only is Saudi Arabia the most influential player in both the Arab and Muslim worlds, it also sets the pace in oil markets. Another advantage is the Kingdom's positive relations with most G20 member states, largely due to Riyadh's policy of ""looking East"" without turning its back on historic ties with the West; Saudi Arabia has a unique ability to liaise with China on the one hand, and with Riyadh's longtime ally the US on the other. With the exception of Turkey, which in recent years has gone from zero conflicts with its neighbors to creating a new enemy every other day, there is not a single G20 country that would not actively work with the Saudi leadership to find a solution to this crisis.
In other words, if ever there was a time for Saudi Arabia to invest its capital of healthy relations and goodwill, now is that time.
Obviously, the task will not be straightforward, because different countries have different views on what the solution is. On the one hand there is Italy, mourning nearly 7,000 deaths, and Japan, home to the world's oldest population and fearing a similar fate. On the other hand, there is the UK with its cautious approach to avoid overwhelming the already stretched National Health Service, and the US, where President Trump believes the cure must not be worse than the problem, and warns against long-term self-isolation and shuttered businesses.
There is also the matter of public liberties, and the possibility that our way of life will change for ever — not in the sense of curfews and other restrictions, which many millennials are experiencing for the first time but which are by definition temporary, but our freedom to travel and mingle with others in public places. Look at what terrorism has already done to air travel — the metal defectors, the random checks, removing your shoes in security, having liquids confiscated. The coronavirus will inevitably herald new security measures related to personal health and hygiene, further limiting our freedom to travel, to enter public buildings, open spaces, even places of worship. This is not the first virus of its kind, and it won't be the last.
Whatever the solution, and the changes that come with it, our lives will not be the same when this is over. As the New York Times columnist Thomas Friedman puts it: ""There is the world B.C. — Before Corona — and there is the world A.C. — After Corona.""

2020-03-26,"In Riyadh, It's The G20 Vs. COVID-19 – OpEd",,"Malacańang on Thursday denied that all personnel of the Office of the President (OP) have already been vaccinated against the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19).
Hindi po totoo iyan (That's not true), Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque said in an online press conference, when quizzed if there is truth to report that all OP officials and employees have already received Covid-19 vaccines.
Roque said OP personnel, who fall under A4 category, would still need to wait for their turn to get the Covid-19 vaccine shots.
A4 pa rin po ang mga government front-liners (Government front-liners are still listed under A4 category), he said.
Establishments, agencies, and organizations (EAOs) have been directed to issue certificates of A4 eligibility to their employees who belong to the category.
EAOs have also been told to provide logistics support, including transportation, to facilitate the inoculation of their workers.
They have also been encouraged to adopt a scheduling system for their workers, taking into consideration possible adverse reactions after vaccination which may lead to workers taking time off from work.
Meantime, Roque also denied report that a member of the Presidential Security Group (PSG) died of Covid-19 last week.
Wala pong katotohanan iyan. Wala pong namatay na miyembro ng PSG dahil po sa Covid (There is no truth to that. No member of PSG died because of Covid), he said, adding that PSG commander Brig. Gen. Jesus Durante III already disputed the claim.
Over 120 PSG personnel have so far contracted Covid-19.
The rise in Covid-19 infections among PSG members early this month prompted President Rodrigo Duterte to postpone his activities to minimize his exposure to the coronavirus. - PNA","COVID CORONAVIRUS (95%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); VACCINES (93%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (90%); CORONAVIRUSES (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); VIRUSES (89%); DEATH NOTICES & OBITUARIES (86%); DEATH & DYING (78%); EMPLOYEE LEAVE (73%); PRESS CONFERENCES (73%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (69%)

2021-04-30,Philippines : Not all OP personnel vaccinated against Covid-19,,"The ACLU's first response to COVID-19, issued March 2, stated that ""individual rights must sometimes give way to the greater good."" It argued that ""people can sometimes be deprived of their liberty through quarantine,"" noting ""this is how it should be.""
This is not an indefensible position. But it is strange coming from an organization that has consistently rejected the need to balance individual rights with the common good. Roger Baldwin, the founder of the ACLU, said he would not serve on a jury because he did not want to be part of convicting anyone. When I asked him how society could function without punishing offenders, he answered, ""That's your problem.""
The ACLU's interest in protecting the public health is also new. In the 1980s, it passed a policy against state laws that criminalized the intentional transmission of AIDS to an innocent unsuspecting person. When I asked one of its officials, Gara LaMarche, to explain, all he could say was ""homosexuals have rights.""
If the public health is now a concern for the ACLU, it should have called for an independent investigation of New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo's March 25 order sending hospitalized nursing home patients with the virus back to their residence; AP estimates that his edict resulted in the deaths of 4,500 patients. The ACLU has said nothing. Indeed, its New York affiliate commended him for leading a ""valiant effort to protect New Yorkers from the coronavirus. His actions have undoubtedly saved lives."" It was referring to his release of prisoners, not his treatment of nursing home patients.
One might expect that the health-conscious ACLU would support President Trump's ban on travel from China, but instead it opposed it. ""These measures are extraordinary incursions on liberty and fly in the face of considerable evidence that travel bans and quarantines can do more harm than good."" Yet when it came to the internment of 110,000 Japanese Americans during World War II—that surely represented ""extraordinary incursions on liberty""—the national office supported it (the Northern California affiliate did not).
If ever there was a government ruling that the ACLU might be expected to oppose it would be the stay-at-home orders issued by governors. But it did not. The ACLU of Minnesota said that ""measures like this have overwhelming support from public health experts trying to protect our collective well-being during this unparalleled crisis."" When the Wisconsin Supreme Court struck down the governor's extension of a stay-at-home order, the Wisconsin affiliate condemned the court for ignoring health warnings, thus ""jeopardizing the health of all Wisconsinites.""
The one exception to the stay-at-home measures it supported was when protesters took to the streets following the death of George Floyd. That was okay, even though thousands of people were jammed together in tight quarters, clearly violating the ACLU's demand for social distancing. All of a sudden, public health considerations were shelved. Never once did it condemn the destruction of property or the looting. It saved its anger for the police.
""Snitch patrols"" in New York City and Los Angeles have been authorized by their mayors: they urge residents to turn in anyone who violates social distancing rules by calling a government hotline. The New York mayor even ordered the police to arrest swimmers. ""Anyone tries to get in the water,"" said Bill de Blasio, ""they'll be taken right out of the water."" The ACLU has said not a word.
Illegal aliens and prisoners have occupied much of the ACLU's resources during this time. Its second statement on the virus called on the Trump administration not to enforce immigration laws. This was quickly followed with a call to release ""vulnerable people from immigrant detention, jails, and prisons."" It sued California Gov. Gavin Newsom for not reducing the population in all of these facilities. In states throughout the nation, it based its position on social distancing needs—not public safety—and even developed its own epidemiological model to project the death toll in jails.
While some of these measures are novel, at bottom they are consistent with the ACLU's policies on prisons. In 1972, it launched the National Prison Project, dedicated to strengthening the rights of prisoners. This initiative was sparked by University of Virginia professor and ACLU operative Philip Hirschkop. Three years earlier he co-authored an article, ""The Unconstitutionality of Prison Life"" the title accurately conveyed his goal and that of the ACLU as well.
In the 1980s, the ACLU made its first foray into economic rights. It stunned traditional civil libertarians who considered this an egalitarian social justice matter, not a civil liberties issue. So it was hardly surprising that its response to coronavirus would include a demand for paid leave, singling out McDonald's workers as a victimized group.
On moral issues, the ACLU sued Arkansas to keep abortion services ongoing during the pandemic. Paradoxically, it said that incarcerated pregnant women should not only be released from prisons and jails, they should be ""prioritized for release."" It never explained why these women were entitled to preferential treatment.
When the ACLU was founded in 1920, it listed among its ten objectives every right encoded in the First Amendment except for the free exercise of religion. So it was only fitting to learn that executive director Anthony Romero told a reporter that he rejected every request to open up churches. Yet when the New York affiliate learned that Cuomo allowed for gatherings of up to 10 people for religious services and Memorial Day celebrations, it sued on behalf of a protester, citing preference for people of faith and veterans. Religious liberty was conveniently used as leverage, not as a right worth defending.
The ACLU's selective departure from traditional civil libertarian policies is a reflection of its origins. The popular notion that the ACLU was founded as a non-partisan defender of individual rights is pure myth.
When theAmerican Mercurypublished a critical article on the ACLU in 1936, it threatened a libel suit. After an initial dustup, both sides agreed to have H.L. Mencken render a judgment. He decided there was nothing libelous about it. The free speech champions instantly branded him a fascist.
The ACLU was founded to defend the rights of labor, not free speech. It was so far left that it supported Stalin's totalitarian regime. Baldwin even admitted that ""Communism is the goal."" Big government was never a problem.
After moving to the center in the 1940s and 1950s, the ACLU turned left again. More recently, under Romero, it has condemned the free speech rights of board members who publicly disagree with its policies and has kept files on contrarian officials, seeking to purge dissidents. Principled civil libertarians such as Alan Dershowitz, Michael Myers and Wendy Kaminer have thrown in the towel. The late Nat Hentoff was also incensed.
If we add to the ACLU's left-wing agenda its almost hysterical hatred of President Trump, its COVID-19 policies make a great deal of sense.

2020-06-11,Making Sense Of The ACLU 'S COVID-19 Response – OpEd,,"Manila, May 27 -- ppointed Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency (PDEA) Director General Wilkins Villanueva on Wednesday said he plans to implement a new protocol on the conduct of anti-illegal drug operations amid the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic.
""Una, malaking challenge sa amin kasi magkakaroon kami ng bagong [First, the big challenge is for us to have a new] protocol on how to conduct anti-drug operations. Unahin muna namin 'yung walang Covid-19 [We will prioritize the areas with no Covid-19 cases],"" Villanueva said in a radio interview.
He said before conducting an operation, the agency will check first if the areas with drug personalities have Covid-19 cases.
To assure the safety of conducting an investigation, PDEA would first assess by identifying the targets.
""Delikado din mga agents, baka mamaya may positive doon [Our agents could be in danger, we don't know if there are positive cases there],"" he added.
Villanueva said PDEA agents would undergo necessary training for anti-drug operations amid the 'new normal' situation.
Meanwhile, Villanueva said he already talked to his predecessor Aaron Aquino to discuss matters on the agency's operations. Before his appointment to PDEA's top post, Villanueva served as its regional director in Northern Mindanao and National Capital Region. He also served at the Bureau of Customs-Customs Intelligence and Investigation Service.
Villanueva also warned drug personalities to stop their illegal acts especially in this time of health crisis.
On Tuesday, Villanueva himself confirmed his appointment by sharing a copy of his appointment paper on his official Facebook account.
Both Executive Secretary Salvador Medialdea and Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque confirmed Villanueva's appointment.
Aquino, meanwhile, was appointed as president and chief executive officer (CEO) of the Clark International Airport Corporation.

2020-05-27,Villanueva eyes 'new protocol' on PDEA ops amid Covid-19,,"Washington: U.S Department of Defense has issued the following news release:
Two Navy hospital ships deployed to New York and Los Angeles to aid in fighting the pandemic are winding down operations, Jonathan Rath Hoffman, assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs,said today.
The USNS Comfort left New York harbor for its home port in Norfolk today. The USNS Mercy in Los Angeles has stopped accepting new patients.
'These are both welcome signs that the American public is following CDC guidelines and the number of COVID-19 cases are decreasing,' Hoffman said. 'Local hospital capacity in these two areas have been sufficient to meet the demand.'
This does not mean that DOD personnel are out of the fight against coronavirus, though. In New York — the hardest hit area in the country — there are almost 700 uniformed doctors and nurses deployed in hospitals in the city and surrounding areas, Hoffman said.
But the DOD has worldwide missions, responsibilities and interests, and the Pentagon spokesman highlighted some of them.
He announced that British Royal Navy Commodore James Parkin turned over command of the International Maritime Security Construct in Manama, Bahrain to British Royal Navy Commodore Rob Bellfield in a virtual ceremony. The construct is meant to secure the vitally important Arabian Gulf region from malign actions. A total of eight nations participate in the construct and Parkin said he expects more to join.
He also noted that yesterday the U.S Transportation Command awarded a $7.2 billion global household goods contract to the American Roll-on, Roll-off Carrier Group of New Jersey. The contract is for relocating service members and their families.
Hoffman also announced that two Navy ships — the USS Barry and USS Bunker Hill — conducted freedom of navigation operations this week in the South China Sea. The ships 'started and ended a full transit at a time and place of our choosing, as we always do,' he said. 'The United States will continue to fly, sail and operate to challenge excessive maritime claims in order to preserve the rights, freedoms and uses of the sea and airspace guaranteed to all nations under international law.'
Finally, he announced that DOD representatives will testify before the Senate Armed Services Committee next week on the Federal Communications Commission decision to award Ligado Networks to deploy a 5G system that could disrupt the Global Positioning System. Dana Deasy, DOD's chief information officer; Michael Griffin, undersecretary of defense for research and engineering; and Space Force Gen. John Raymond, the chief of space operations and commander of U.S Space Command, will testify before the panel.","NAVIES (91%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (90%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (89%); ADMIRALTY LAW (78%); ARMED FORCES (78%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (78%); FREEDOM OF THE SEAS (78%); MARINE SHIPPING (78%); MARINE TRANSPORTATION SAFETY (78%); OUTPUT & DEMAND (77%); DEFENSE & MILITARY POLICY (73%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (73%); MILITARY DEPENDENTS (73%); NURSES & NURSING (73%); PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS (73%); CORONAVIRUSES (72%); VIRUSES (70%); INTERNATIONAL LAW (66%); GLOBAL POSITIONING SYSTEM (62%); EXECUTIVES (60%); TELECOMMUNICATIONS DEPARTMENTS (60%); ENERGY & UTILITY LAW (50%)

2020-05-04,"COVID-19 Ops, Bahrain Command, 5G Problems Briefed at Pentagon",,"Last month, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo spoke for many Blue state Democrats when he cautioned about reopening the economy too quickly, noting that to do so would jeopardize the public health. He was emphatic, insisting that ""every life is priceless. Period.""
Pro-life Americans weren't buying it. Cuomo is so radical in his defense of abortion—for any reason and at any time of gestation—that he even defends infanticide: the ""former altar boy,"" as he likes to describe himself, says it is perfectly legal for medical personnel not to save the life of a baby struggling to stay alive as a result of a botched abortion. Ergo, not every life is priceless.
It is striking to note that of the three states that included specific abortion protections in their COVID-19 policies, two of them, New Jersey and Virginia, were among the last to end their stay-at-home restrictions; they did so on June 9 and June 10, respectively. The governors did not explain why their interest in public health, and their determination to prolong the shutdown, made an exception for their abortion clinics. But we all know why.
Twelve states attempted to block elective abortions as non-essential services in their COVID-19 policies. Ten of them have Red state Republican governors and Republican majorities in both chambers of the legislature. Two are mixed, having Republican legislative majorities and Democrat governors. None are Blue states; they are run by Democrats in the executive and legislative branches.
Of these 12 pro-life states, most were among the first to reopen. Three of them, Arkansas, Oklahoma and Iowa, never had a stay-at-home order. Six others—Alabama, Alaska, Texas, Tennessee, West Virginia and Mississippi—were among the earliest to reopen; they did so at the end of April and the beginning of May.
The pattern is obvious: Blue states, which made sure abortions could be performed during the shutdown, lagged behind the pro-life Red states in reopening.
Some might conclude that the Blue states, aside from not protecting the life of the unborn, still have a better record than the Red states when it comes to maximizing public health: their decision not to reopen too quickly showed how concerned they are about the need for social distancing during the pandemic.
This argument, however, is seriously undercut by the willingness of Blue state mayors and governors to throw their concern for social distancing to the wind when they allowed thousands of protesters to take to the streets in their locales. These executives were far more determined to stop a handful of the faithful from assembling in their houses of worship than they were to stop throngs of young people from protesting: social distancing norms were violated with impunity in one Blue state after another. Moreover, their passivity in reining in the most violent of the protesters makes ludicrous their concern for public health and safety.
Ideally, politics should play no role in a pandemic. That it has is glaringly obvious.

Liberian President George Weah — winner of 1995 Ballon d'or in football — has turned to his talent as a singer to help slow the spread of COVID-19.
As of April 22, there are101 confirmed COVID-19 casesin Liberia and 8 confirmed deaths.
Together with renowned Liberian gospel and secular musicians, Weah recorded his song to spread""the message of unity in the country in order to halt the spread of the virus,""writesGary Connaughton:
We're all in this together. The main message being preached throughout the world is that regardless of your own health status, we can all do our bit to stop the spread of the coronavirus. That means staying at home when possible, practicing good hygiene, being able to spot potential symptoms, and staying away from high risk people. It's fairly straightforward stuff, but it can save lives.
The upbeat song encourages citizens to get together to ""fight corona,"" with Weah singing ""everything is possible. …. let's stand together to fight this deadly disease, now!""
It is not the first time that Weah has tapped his singing talent to address the nation. In late 2019, shaken by violence, protest movements and strikes,Weah released a song called""Peace In Our Nation, Peace In Our Land,""in whichhe called for peaceful solutions to the nation's problems.
On April, 8, Weahaddressedthe nation, recalling the establishment of the Committee on Coronavirus (SPACOC) two months earlier. He also declared a three-week State of Emergency throughout Liberia, starting April 10, 2020, and renewable until the COVID-19 threat ends.
Among other measures, Weah confined four counties to stay-at-home orders. Headded:
Hundreds of thousands of persons around the globe have been infected by [the coronavirus], thousands have died as a result of contracting it, and many more thousands are predicted to die. The disease has overwhelmed more advanced health care systems in many countries, and has brought the economies of several developed nations almost to a complete halt…
Throughout this period, residents may leave home only for essential journeys for reasons of health and food, which should be restricted to your local community only, and be limited to a single person per household for a maximum of one hour.
Exceptions were made those deemed ""essential workers.""
On Friday, April 17, 2020, members of the Liberian Senate and House of Representatives endorsed Weah's declaration of a state of emergency.
Writer Jonathan Brownewroteabout Weah's emergency relief fund to assist those struggling with these new measures:
They call for creation of a COVID 19 Emergency Relief Fund that would solicit private donations from individuals, group of individuals, local and international private organizations, business enterprises and any other person interested in assisting the most vulnerable populations of the Republic against the scourge of COVID 19.
Accordingto journalistLeroy M. Sonpon, III, lawmakers went beyond the president's request by granting aninitial $25 million United States dollars for a food support program that will include all of 15 counties in Liberia, with the caveat that locally produced food get prioritized — along with vulnerable populations such as youth, homeless, orphanages, senior citizens, people with disabilities and health workers.
Facing COVID-19 in Liberia
A strong solidarity movement has swept through the country that knows first hand the scourge of highly contagious viruses such asEbolain 2014-2016.
Liberians have generated donations to support COVID-19 interventions and several campaigns to promote education and awareness.
The World Bankalso swiftly approveda $7.5 million USD International Development Association (IDA) to finance Liberia's response to COVID-19.
Christopher C. Walkerreportson the production of locally-made, reusable face masks in Liberia throughthe Liberia Initiative for Empowerment (LIFE):
The mask, which is produced in Liberia, would be distributed to hundreds of Liberians and non-Liberians who are residing in Liberia to be used to prevent the virus…
Megan Beare, an Irish volunteer in Liberia, could have been evacuated butchose to stay:
I am also young and healthy. I feel that staying here is just the right thing for me to do so that we can help as many as we can andtry prevent any further spread of COVID-19. It isjust four years after Liberians celebrated being free from the Ebola virus that killed 4,800 people here in the first year of that outbreak in 2014.
Despite the solidarity, Weah still faces critique in Liberia over a tanking economy. Severalprotests against the governmenthave taken place in January alone.
Journalist Andrew Greenreportedon January 10 that these protests were ""the most significant protests in Liberia in over a decade,"" according toElizabeth Donnelly, deputy head of the Africa Program at Chatham House. ""President George Weah, having inherited a difficult economic situation, has quickly descended from hero to let-down in the popular imagination,"" said Donnelly.
Protesters had demanded that Weah fire his entire team of economic advisers.
Indeed, while Weah has been commended for his singing talents and economic measures in response to COVID-19, Smart News Liberiafindsthat troubling, new restrictions imposed by Liberian authorities on independent media could undermine public health.
""Only state broadcaster ELBC is granted unhindered access to report what the regime wants,"" according to Smart News Liberia.

2020-04-22,Liberia 's President George Weah Sings His Fight Against COVID-19 – OpEd,,"Community leaders in the federal electorate of rogue LNP backbencher George Christensen are concerned about his increasingly controversial views on COVID lockdowns and vaccinations.
""His views are not necessarily reflective of the community he represents,"" said fellow LNP member Amanda Camm, whose state electorate of Whitsunday takes in the northern part of George Christensen's federal seat of Dawson.
""I would say in the last week, his style of approach, his recent speech in the parliament was questionable.""
A state Labor MP whose electorate covers the southern part of Dawson had even harsher words.
""People are becoming confused about the message that he's spreading, especially older people who have put faith on what he has had to say,"" said Julieanne Gilbert, the member of Mackay.
""This is becoming dangerous.""
'Lockdowns don't work', claims Christensen
Mr Christensen told federal parliament last week he considered COVID lockdowns and other public health measures such as wearing masks to be ""madness"".
""It's time we stopped spreading fear and acknowledge some facts — masks do not work,"" he said.
""Lockdowns don't work, but they do destroy people's livelihoods and people's lives.
""Our posturing politicians, many over there, the sensationalist media elite and the dictatorial medical bureaucrats need to recognise these facts.""
Labor successfully moved a motion condemning Mr Christensen's comments, arguing they were aimed at spreading misinformation and undermining Australia's COVID-19 response.
Mr Christensen's website also discusses his vaccine hesitancy.
""There are many Australians who, like me, are not 'anti-vaxxers' but have legitimate concerns about injecting themselves and their family members with a rushed vaccine,"" he said on the website.
The website also links to a video from an April interview with a group called Reignite Democracy Australia.
""People should have individual choice in this — as for me, I'm not getting a vaccine anytime soon,"" he told the compère.
A spokesperson for Mr Christensen declined to comment on the backbencher's current vaccine status, saying ""George's private health decisions are just that – private.""
Mr Christensen's electorate of Dawson takes in the Mackay Whitsunday region, which has some of the lowest vaccination rates in the country.
Christensen's comments 'not constructive'
Amanda Camm, who has been urging people to get vaccinated, takes issue with the federal member's messaging.
""I believe that everyone has the right to their opinion and to say what they want to say, but when it is placing fear and it is used in a way that is not constructive, I'm very concerned,"" she told 7.30. 
While Mackay Mayor Greg Williamson doesn't agree with Mr Christensen's views about vaccines, he doesn't believe he's doing any damage.
""We are used to the 'George-speak' … we're used to the inflammatory process [by] which George goes about making a statement,"" he said.
""You've got to defend the right of a democratically elected member of parliament to question the processes that he sees aren't right at the moment.""
Mr Christensen announced earlier this year that he would be retiring from parliament at the next election.
But his ""Nation First"" online newsletter talks about launching a regular YouTube show.
""I hope I will bring you the best news and views out there that relates to the pro-freedom, patriotic and conservative agenda,"" he said.
Mr Christensen declined to talk to 7.30 about his future plans.
""Life after parliament is probably what George is focusing on right now,"" said Mr Williamson.
Analyst with the Australian Strategic Policy Institute, Ariel Bogle, said the member for Dawson – along with a number of other conservative politicians who are leaving parliament soon – may be cultivating a particular audience for some kind of media business.
""Certainly some of the recent rhetoric around lockdowns, around masks and vaccines have ended up on conservative, and you might even call far-right US publications — so there's certainly a symbiotic relationship that we'll have to see how it plays out,"" she said.

2021-08-18,Community leaders in George Christensen's electorate call out his controversial COVID-19 opinions,,"It has been a topsy-turvy start to the third decade of this century. COVID-19 has brought with it many disruptions.
Coronavirus has significantly changed the contours of professional life.
These days, home is the new office.
The Internet is the new meeting room.
For the time being, office breaks with colleagues are history.
I have also been adapting to these changes. Most meetings, be it with minister colleagues, officials and world leaders, are now via video conferencing.
In order to get ground level feedback from various stakeholders, there have been videoconference meetings with several sections of society. There were extensive interactions with NGOs, civil society groups and community organisations. There was an interaction with Radio Jockeys too.
Besides that, I have been making numerous phone calls daily, taking feedback from different sections of society.
One is seeing the ways through which people are continuing their work in these times. There are a few creative videos by our film stars conveying a relevant message of staying home. Our singers did an online concert. Chess players played chess digitally and through that contributed to the fight against COVID-19. Quite innovative!
The work place is getting Digital First. And, why not?
After all, the most transformational impact of Technology often happens in the lives of the poor. It is technology that demolishes bureaucratic hierarchies, eliminates middlemen and accelerates welfare measures.
Let me give you an example.
When we got the opportunity to serve in 2014, we started connecting Indians, especially the poor with their Jan Dhan Account, Aadhar & Mobile number. This seemingly simple connection has not only stopped corruption and rent seeking that was going on for decades, but has also enabled the Government to transfer money at the click of a button. This click of a button has replaced multiple levels of hierarchies on the file and also weeks of delay.
India has perhaps the largest such infrastructure in the world. This infrastructure has helped us tremendously in transferring money directly and immediately to the poor and needy, benefiting crores of families, during the COVID-19 situation.

Another case in point is the education sector. There are many outstanding professionals already innovating in this sector. Invigorating technology in this sector has its benefits. The Government of India has also undertaken efforts such as the DIKSHA Portal, to help teachers and boost e-learning. There is SWAYAM, aimed at improving access, equity and quality of education. E-Pathshala, which is available in many languages, enables access to various e-books and such learning material.
Today, the world is in pursuit of new business models.
India, a youthful nation known for its innovative zeal can take the lead in providing a new work culture.
I envision this new business and work culture being redefined on the following vowels.
I call them- vowels of the new normal- because like vowels in the English language, these would become essential ingredients of any business model in the post-COVID world.
Adaptability:
The need of the hour is to think of business and lifestyle models that are easily adaptable.
Doing so would mean that even in a time of crisis, our offices, businesses and commerce could get moving faster, ensuring loss of life does not occur.
Embracing digital payments is a prime example of adaptability. Shop owners big and small should invest in digital tools that keep commerce connected, especially in times of crisis. India is already witnessing an encouraging surge in digital transactions.
Another example is telemedicine. We are already seeing several consultations without actually going to the clinic or hospital. Again, this is a positive sign. Can we think of business models to help further telemedicine across the world?
Efficiency:
Perhaps, this is the time to think of reimagining what we refer to as being efficient.
Efficiency cannot only be about- how much time was spent in the office.
We should perhaps think of models where productivity and efficiency matter more than appearance of effort.
The emphasis should be on completing a task in the specified time frame.
Inclusivity:
Let us develop business models that attach primacy to care for the poor, the most vulnerable as well as our planet.
We have made major progress in combating climate change. Mother Nature has demonstrated to us her magnificence, showing us how quickly it can flourish when human activity is slower. There is a significant future in developing technologies and practices that reduce our impact on the planet. Do more with less.
COVID-19 has made us realise the need to work on health solutions at low cost and large scale. We can become a guiding light for global efforts to ensure the health and well being of humanity.
We should invest in innovations to make sure our farmers have access to information, machinery, and markets no matter what the situation, that our citizens have access to essential goods.
Opportunity:
Every crisis brings with it an opportunity. COVID-19 is no different.
Let us evaluate what might be the new opportunities/growth areas that would emerge now.
Rather than playing catch up, India must be ahead of the curve in the post-COVID world. Let us think about how our people, our skills sets, our core capabilities can be used in doing so.
Universalism:
COVID-19 does not see race, religion, colour, caste, creed, language or border before striking.
Our response and conduct thereafter should attach primacy to unity and brotherhood.
We are in this together.
Unlike previous moments in history, when countries or societies faced off against each other, today we are together facing a common challenge. The future will be about togetherness and resilience.
The next big ideas from India should find global relevance and application. They should have the ability to drive a positive change not merely for India but for the entire humankind.
Logistics was previously only seen through the prism of physical infrastructure – roads, warehouses, ports.But logistical experts these days can control global supply chains through the comfort of their own homes.
India, with the right blend of the physical and the virtual can emerge as the global nerve centre of complex modern multinational supply chains in the post COVID-19 world. Let us rise to that occasion and seize this opportunity.
I urge you all to think about this and contribute to the discourse.
The shift from BYOD to WFH brings new challenges to balance the official and personal. Whatever be the case, devote time to fitness and exercising.Try Yoga as a means to improve physical and mental wellbeing.
Traditional medicine systems of India are known to help keep the body fit. The Ayush Ministry has come out with a protocol that would help in staying healthy. Have a look at these as well.
Lastly, and importantly, please download Aarogya Setu Mobile App.This is a futuristic App that leverages technology to help contain the possible spread of COVID-19. More the downloads, more its effectiveness.
Will wait to hear from you all…

2020-04-19,India 's PM Modi: Life In The Era Of COVID-19 – OpEd,,"It is distressing  to learn that a few print and visual media managements have closed down some of the editions, sacked a few of the employees including journalists and reporters and have asked a number of them to go on leave without pay, in the wake of the COVID-19 crisis.
A few of the print and visual media managements that have resorted to this ""strategy"" have reasonably healthy balance sheets during the last few years and have  good reserves.  Certainly, they have the financial strength to manage for a period of a  few  months during the COVID-19 crisis.
While some small outfits may have reasons for reducing the number of employees or delaying the payment of wages, this cannot be so in the case of medium and large media houses. In this scenario, one gets an impression whether the media managements consider the journalists and reporters as  ""disposable items"", obviously implying that they have least consideration about the welfare of these people and their families. Some may even suspect whether a few media managements have used the ""Covid-19 opportunity"" to get rid of surplus staff or inconvenient staff.
In such circumstances, one wonders whether the media would have the same image and prestige again after the COVID 19 crisis.
It is widely recognised that media is one of the strong pillars of democracy and an independent and self-respecting media is absolutely essential for the survival of democratic traditions and practices.
Journalists, reporters and editors are generally believed to be sacrificing their personal interests for the sake of the cause that they espouse. Several journalists and reporters have suffered in the past and even faced violent attacks and court proceedings due to their independent writings and observations.
In such circumstances, if an impression would gain ground that media  has  gone under the control  of the profit oriented business houses, which would resort to closure as a knee jerk reaction for a temporary problem, without commitment to the cause of journalism, then inevitably media would lose the credibility in the eyes of the public.
Already, we often hear about what is known as paid news and motivated campaign by section of media depending upon the ownership of the media . Whether one likes it or not, it has to be admitted that readers often express suspicions about the credibility of some writings and publications in the print and visual media. This is not a healthy development.
In the aftermath of the COVID 19 crisis, a few media managements seem to be adopting the functioning style of commercial enterprises and  dispense with the employees at the stroke of a pen, due to business losses. In most cases, this appears to have been done  without adequately evaluating  and implementing alternative remedial strategies, in the face of a temporary problem created by COVID 19 crisis.
Certainly, media houses could have taken loan from the financial institutions to overcome the financial crisis faced by them just for a few months, if necessary.
One gets an impression that, probably, some of the media houses that have resorted to terminating  the service of journalists and reporters lack confidence in their ability to overcome the temporary financial issues after the COVID 19 crisis, which would pass away as  the time would move on.
As said earlier, the essence of journalism and media houses is the readiness and capability to withstand pressure, make sacrifices if required with deep and sustained faith in the journalistic ethos.
When media managements readily resort to sacking employees and closing down editions in the face of a temporary crisis, it reflects the fact that section of  media houses have become solely profit oriented with other glorious aspects and objectives of journalism being given up on flimsy grounds.
The result of the panicky reaction of some media houses would be that media managements can not any more count on the loyalty and confidence level and independent investigative method of the journalists and reporters who may be forced to change their approach to journalism due to job security issues.
One cannot be blamed, if he would think that section of media houses have lost the glorious opportunity to prove their mettle in standing up to the COVID 19 crisis and instead they buckled under pressure, with monetary benefits getting central viewpoint.
It is admitted that print and visual media cannot be run when they incur losses for a length of time. But, a few months of COVID 19 crisis cannot be a justifiable reason for ""thinning down the media"".

2020-06-15,Will Indian Media Be The Same After COVID-19 Crisis? – OpEd,,"Mar 25, 2021( Deutsche Welle Sports: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/sports/s-8171 Delivered by Newstex)  As expected, Germany beat Iceland in their first World Cup qualifier. DW's Jonathan Harding believes that playing hours after a player tested positive for COVID-19 leaves questions about Germany's priorities.Germany started their qualifying campaign off with the win expected of them. 
In one of their best displays in months, their midfield was excellent, Jamal Musiala made his debut and their new away kit looked slick. But rather than how Germany won the game, it was the lengths they went to play it that was the most telling.Without question, the team's Premier League players were flown in to join the squad. Germany reached an agreement with the local health department that saw those five players bubble inside the Germany bubble, effectively meaning other than training, games and team meetings, they were on their own.Team doctor Tim Meyer has, according to Joachim Löw, constantly been running after the head coach — presumably from a safe distance — telling him all about the procedures to follow. Masks were worn, distances were being kept in team and one-on-one meetings.On the morning of the game, it was announced that Borussia Mönchengladbach midfielder Jonas Hofmann had tested positive for COVID-19. He was then placed in quarantine. Marcel Halstenberg, who was deemed a ""first degree contact person"", having played backgammon with Hofmann on Wednesday evening, returned to Leipzig to quarantine. Not long afterwards, chief press officer Jens Grittner relayed the message that Germany would ""definitely be playing.""Deja vuThe news was hardly surprising. After a similar situation in November last year, when Germany met Ukraine, the game went ahead with little hesitation. But at what point does this association, do these players, ask whether it is worth the risk?Germany did everything they could to make sure they could play. As footballers, and as an association with contractual obligations, that is understandable. But at what point do you consider the human being? ""We are people too and it affects us just as much,"" Ilkay Gündogan said afterwards, of the impact of the Hofmann case.After all, despite Meyer's new procedures, bubbles for Premier League players, rapid and PCR tests, ubitquitous FFP2 masks during leisure activities such as playing board games, there was still a case of COVID-19.This virus does not care if you are an international footballer. It doesn't care how exciting Germany looked, who played in attack or who made their debut.Identity questionsRapid tests done on Thursday delivered the desired negative results, but if symptoms can take anywhere between 2-14 days to appear, then who are you really kidding? What do you really care about?While Germany battles a third wave of the coronavirus as a nation, Germany the football team continues to show that whatever happens, no matter the potential risks, they will keep playing.For a team apparently keen on reconnecting with its fans and showing that it is not completely detached from the country it represents, this was a night when it did everything but.","EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (99%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); SPORTS & RECREATION (90%); ATHLETES (89%); PROFESSIONAL SPORTS (89%); SOCCER (89%); COACHES & TRAINERS (79%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (79%); AGREEMENTS (78%); ISOLATION & QUARANTINE (78%); BOARD GAMES (77%); FIFA WORLD CUP (77%); SOCCER TOURNAMENTS (77%); SPORTS AWARDS (77%); TALKS & MEETINGS (74%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (72%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (69%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (68%); Sports (%)

2021-03-25,Opinion: Germany 's COVID-19 misstep,,"Gabriel Garcia Marquez has a bestselling, multi-award winning novel called ""Love in the Time of Cholera"". We are now in the curfew for the 65+ age group. ""Life in the days of Coronavirus"" has begun.
In our environment, everyone wears a protective mask and gloves. There is no food, no cleaning supplies, nothing on the shelves left in the markets. We always put on a protective face mask on the road, on the metro, on the bus, at the airports. Coronavirus has been very effective all over the world. It begins with the appearance of a seasonal cold, the back of which becomes pneumonia. The elderly and the male population are affected a lot. There is no vaccine for coronavirus yet, no preventive healing drugs. Wear a mask, wash your hands frequently, do not kiss, do not shake hands. Work from home, set up a home-office, avoid crowded indoor spaces, sit in the corridor in front of the aircraft, minimize your stay in public transport, keep your immune system strong, eat chicken soup, eat eggs for breakfast. Follow the advice of experts.
If there is visible political uncertainty, an epidemic or a danger of war, economic difficulties, people and companies naturally stop, suspend their business, and wait for this event to pass. They go into the Wait-See order. They do not spend outside the daily routine required, they do not take the initiative in a new investment subject. Investments, expenditures slow down, and stop. There are delays in payment of money, and collection of receivables becomes difficult. Everyone tries to stay liquid in cash. It is Okay so far. These can happen in hard times. However, what companies should not do is cut advertising, stop sales activities, stop preliminary studies, stop feasibility of investments, and interrupt engineering studies.
Do not do this unless it is necessary for cash. These are not about spending money. The money spent for these studies is not much. Do not cut your ads. Do not interrupt your sales and marketing efforts. Do not stop your engineering work, investment works. Continue your feasibility. Continue your EIA applications. Follow your EPDK license applications. Continue your staff training. Produce new investment projects and continue your engineering studies. These do not hold money. But it keeps you economically alive. If you are reading this article on the internet, you must have been well educated, have an above-average level of life or are dedicated to it. Read our articles, news, articles. We spend a lot of time writing these articles, know this. Printed paper newspaper comes in front of subscriber money. Our web page, is free.
Difficult times are mostly medium or short periods. You will stop working. When you continue your work without interruption, then you go straight, you will get a job easier, make sales, and continue your investments. Difficult times come and pass, according to democratic practices, solutions that will satisfy everyone more or less are created. In democracies, the remedy is inexhaustible.
We now live in a global village. Everyone is aware of everyone. Everything is so open so obvious. Everything is known. Economic life must go hand in hand with democracy. Democracy understanding of each country is different. It is not possible to be equivalent. The United States, Britain, Germany, or Japan, India, even Brazil, Argentina have democracy regimes in their own functioning that fit their historical development. It is not correct to show one example to another. Turkey has a history of democracy starting from the 1946s, dating back to the 1920s, even to the 1908s, or even older. We learned what to do and what should not be done in our history of democracy with painful experiences, we are still learning, learning will not end, we will learn again in the future.
Do something for yourself in difficult times. Take a regular walk in the nearby open air every day, go up and down stairs, do not skip breakfast, eat mainly vegetables, play sports where possible, listen to music. Listen to more TRT3 classical radio operas, watch less TV. Do not cut your sales activities, advertisements, produce new investment projects, do feasibilities, develop projects, continue your engineering studies in difficult times. Regardless, let's know that we are in a unique democratic country. Let us know that the remedy is not exhausted in democracies. Hard times, epidemics, troubles come and go, nothing stays the same, don't worry.
The post Life In #COVID-19 Times - OpEd appeared first on Eurasia Review.",,751,Newstex Blogs
2020-03-22,Life In #COVID-19 Times – OpEd,,"The media's coverage of COVID-19 is being questioned as the disease sweeps across the world. The pandemic has severely tested national health systems and is wreaking havoc on economies and ordinary lives. How can the media constructively communicate the urgency and severity of pandemics without contributing to a climate of fear and panic?
This question is especially pertinent to African news media given that international news flow has historically remained in favour of the developed world. In this context, how can African journalism negotiate its place - and the continent's interests - in the global news narrative? How can African journalism highlight the continent's challenges and vulnerabilities, which are often ignored by internationalised responses?
The COVID-19 pandemic threatens hundreds of thousands of lives across borders. International travel as result of tourism, migration and business makes Africa a part of the international circuit of leisure and trade. The inter-relatedness of world economies makes coverage of the spread and impact of the virus in Europe, China and the US vitally important to African newsrooms and audiences. When Western and Eastern economies are hit Africa's will be, too.
Yet one must ask how inclusive the coverage of the international response to the pandemic has been. And what role African news media should be playing in ensuring responses to the epidemic work for the continent.
My fear is that Africa's news media is abdicating its responsibilities by not questioning the appropriateness of the global response to the crisis. It is failing to address practical, historical, cultural and political questions around the interventions aimed at stopping the spread of COVID-19.
Instead, the continent's media appear to be reproducing internationalised narratives. These, in turn, are feeding policy interventions that are not likely to mitigate this crisis. They are in fact likely to exacerbate it.
Fundamentally, African journalism must ask itself whether it is largely irrelevant or simply incapable of constructing or shaping an international news narrative that recognises the continent's challenges and interests.
Lessons from Ebola
The operations of the World Health Organisation (WHO) reflect its funding profile as well as the uneven power relations that characterise the international world order. WHO guidelines on pandemics tend to internationalise interventions that ignore the variable experiences of a large part of the world.
Efforts to get the Ebola epidemic under control in West Africa are a case in point. Interventions began to work only after local communities reframed the WHO's containment guidelines.
Experts have argued that the adoption of international guidelines relating to the disposal of bodies of Ebola victims failed because they didn't recognise the strength of local cultural practices. People thus put themselves at great risk to give the departed dignified burials.
The local media played an important role in communicating these cultural details.
The continent's media should learn from these experiences in its coverage of the the COVID-19 pandemic and its mitigation.
Besides being the principal purveyors of public information, the news media in these countries are key to shaping government policy.
The WHO has urged the public to implement a number of measures. These have included social distancing and self-isolation. In addition, governments are increasingly imposing quarantines. These measures have been legitimised by the international news media. They've also been reproduced largely uncontested across Africa - from Johannesburg to Nairobi to Lagos.
Unsurprisingly therefore, governments across the continent have instituted the WHO guidelines and followed in the footsteps of Europe, China and the US.
The African media has failed to develop an alternative narrative encouraging the WHO and governments to ensure measures are appropriate for local conditions.
For example, social distancing, self-isolation and quarantines are largely impractical in a number of African countries. In an environment in which most people get their food and other daily needs from open air informal markets, it is remarkably ironic that local media should concentrate on panic buying and the provision of sanitisers in the supermarkets in Nairobi and Johannesburg's leafy suburbs.
Similarly, how does one self-isolate in the context of Nairobi's sprawling slums? There, a single room is shared by family and extended kin. How do you agree to a quarantine when you have lived under a surveillance state you are deeply suspicious of in Uganda, Zimbabwe and Rwanda? Indeed the immediate cultural inflection associated with quarantine is detention. It does not imply safety.
In addition, how can the African news media fail to point out the fallacy of state directives for people to work from home, with no prospects of any financial support when 85% of the population work in the informal sector?
Stigma
The African coverage of the AIDS pandemic in the 1980s was fraught with narratives of death and doom. This created a dangerous climate of stigma. That, in turn, hindered effective public health messaging. The result was that hundreds of thousands of Africans died.
This history of stigma, a most dangerous enemy in viral disease containment, has never been addressed. In the current climate it's the media's responsibility to demolish the myth that COVID-19 is a foreign killer virus akin to AIDS. Legitimising this myth inevitably mobilises a popular history that will hinder the fight against the spread of the virus.

2020-03-24,Why Africa's Journalists Aren't Doing a Good Job On COVID-19 [opinion],,"Public health officials should manage this global COVID pandemic like medical professionals who care about the health of their citizens. This is no time to play politics with people's lives. Yes, people are reluctant about vaccinations, but much of that fear stems from the lack of information, especially in a country with a high illiteracy rate.
Throughout this vaccination process, there was a general lack of communication and information flow to the public about the vaccine, timelines, and expiration dates. The lack of information from official sources is one of the major reasons for mistrust between citizens and their government. Public health officials encourage fake news and rumors when they fail to effectively provide relevant information about the vaccination campaign.
Yes, people stood in lines at health facilities, churches, and community centers, but those numbers did not increase until June when people started dying every day from COVID, and sick people were seen hooked up to oxygen machines in the parking lot at JFK Medical Center. There should have been as much information about the vaccine and its expiration date as there was about telling people mostly in Montserrado, to get vaccinated.
Liberia received 96,000 doses of AstraZeneca vaccine for its population of 4.5 million people. As of July 5, 2021, 85,132 people (including 18,921 health workers and 66,211 others) had been vaccinated. Of that total amount, 6,439 people have received second shots.
My 89-year-old aunt is expected to take her second shot on July 16, but I am told that there are no vaccines. If vaccines exist, they are expired. The vaccine expired July 10, 2021. Did the Ministry of Health make any major public announcement about the expiration date? As a communication expert, I have not seen any communication strategy that is being implemented about the so-called vaccination campaign.
It is not enough to have a press conference and talk about the number of COVID cases, number of deaths and trends. People need accurate, up-to-date information to make informed decisions. Now, if I took my first shot six weeks ago and you tell me to return on July 16 for the second shot, I would assume that the vaccine would be available. Now, we are hearing (unofficially because the government has not made this public. People are scrambling for second shots) that there are no vaccines in the country. First, we heard new doses of vaccines would be available the second week in July.
Now, we are hearing that the vaccines are expected the end of July and will be available to the public by August 15. We are also hearing that Liberia will also be getting more AstraZenPost Views: 83eca, Pfizer, and Johnson&Johnson. We are hearing that people who took AstraZeneca can take JJ for their second shot.
In a population where people are already suspicious of the vaccine, you need to start doing awareness about this mixing of vaccines before the distribution begins. The public needs to know what they will be taking and why. You cannot just give people anything and expect them to take it without understanding the implications.
Many people in this high-illiteracy rate population have android phones which give them access to the internet, but they cannot search Google to learn about these vaccines. They are depending on their government to give them the right information. The information should come from the public health officials, so that people do not rely on faked news and rumors.
The day I took my first shot, I told my driver he had to take the vaccine, too. I was not going to have him driving me around without being vaccinated. After we both had taken the shot, the nurse encouraged him to bring his wife and children. She also asked him if he had a 9-year-old daughter.
He said, yes. She told him to bring his daughter for the ""cancer vaccine."" Really?
She was referring to Gardasil, the vaccine known for preventing certain strains of HPV, the virus that causes cervical cancer. The vaccine targets girls, as young as 9-years-old. (It is believed that it is more effective before the girl become sexually active) This vaccine was very controversial when it came out in America in 2006.
Though 120 countries have approved the drug, I never heard of any major public health campaign for Gardasil in Liberia. Information about Gardasil should be widely available as information about vaccines for childhood communicable diseases.
In 2014, Liberia received the Gardasil vaccine, but the vaccination campaign was delayed because of the Ebola crisis. When Liberia was declared Ebola free, MOH hurriedly vaccinated young girls in a few counties because the vaccine was about to expire. I am mentioning the Gardasil situation to show how public health officials do not do a good job informing the public about vaccines. The nurse did not explain to my driver what Gardasil was all about.
Why should my driver care about preventing his daughter from getting cancer? What kind of cancer was she talking about? I am also sure there are parents, especially those with little or no education, who have agreed to Gardasil without knowing what it was all about. I had to explain Gardasil to my driver and encouraged him to read more about it on the internet, so he could have an informed opinion to determine whether his daughter takes it or not. Vaccines are good but give people the information they need to make informed decisions about their family's health.","EPIDEMICS (94%); VACCINES (93%); PUBLIC HEALTH (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (91%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PUBLIC OFFICIALS (90%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (90%); HEALTH MISINFORMATION (78%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (78%); PRESS CONFERENCES (78%); PROFESSIONAL WORKERS (78%); DEATH RATES (76%); GOSSIP & RUMORS (74%); LITERACY RATES (71%); LITERACY & ILLITERACY (57%); Liberia (%); Coronavirus (%)

2021-07-15,No Time to Play Politics With Covid-19 Pandemic [opinion],,"Coronavirus cases are surging anew, thanks to the delta variant, and there is fiery debate about mandating vaccines. New York City just announced it will require proof of vaccination to access restaurants, gyms and other indoor public settings -- the first major U.S. city to do so. 
Dr. Leana Wen, emergency medicine physician and public health professor at George Washington University, argues that COVID-19 vaccines should be required for all eligible Americans before the situation spins out of control. Wen, former Baltimore City Health Commissioner and author of the new book ""Lifelines: A Doctor's Journey in the Fight for Public Health,"" is also the mother of two young children who are not yet able to get vaccinated. 
As told to Lindsay Lyon as part of Two Takes, a U.S. News series examining opinions about key issues. Responses have been edited for length and clarity. 
Should everyone in the U.S. be required to get the COVID-19 vaccine?
Yes, everybody who is eligible should be required to get vaccinated if they want to engage with others in public spaces. 
We are not talking here about someone choosing an unhealthy diet -- something you could argue only affects an individual. We're talking about a very contagious disease that is so easily transmissible it's caused a global pandemic and has killed more than 600,000 Americans and millions of people around the world. 
[OPINION:Why COVID-19 Vaccines Should Not Be Required for All Americans]
No one has the right to infect others with a potentially deadly illness. 
There's also this fallacy that vaccination is only a matter of individual choice. There are two issues with that: One is that there are many people, including our young children, who are not yet eligible to be vaccinated. There are also immunosuppressed Americans who do not have full immunity from the vaccine. 
How is it fair that someone can opt to not be vaccinated and then spread the illness to vulnerable groups who did not make the choice to be so vulnerable? 
The second issue is that even if you are vaccinated, protection is not 100%. Think of the vaccine as a very good raincoat: It will protect you well in a drizzle, but if you are in and out of constant thunderstorms -- in this case, constantly surrounded by people who are unvaccinated and unmasked -- at some point, you could become infected and transmit the illness to others. 
So vaccination cannot be perceived as an individual choice. Instead, we need to equate it much more so to drunk driving. You can drink in private -- that's your choice -- but you can't just decide to get behind the wheel because you feel like it and don't think you'll get hurt. We have laws against drunk driving, since individual choice to undertake a dangerous public activity cannot override the need to protect the public from deadly harm. 
We are all eager to get back to life as before. We want our kids to go to school without being sent home constantly due to positive cases and the need to quarantine. We want workplaces to come back without the need for masks and distancing. We want our economy to thrive and travel to return to pre-pandemic normal. If we want those things to happen, then it's necessary for all people who are eligible in those environments to be vaccinated. 
We've talked previously about the CDC's precipitous and premature lifting of mask mandates -- which have essentially just been reversed in areas of high viral transmission. The honor code didn't work, and we are already seeing my biggest fear play out: Once again, COVID-19 is surging across the country with cases rising in all 50 states. We are seeing unvaccinated individuals, including kids, ending up severely ill. Don't we have an obligation to protect our young children? 
I hope that we move to a system like what France has just enacted, which is to require vaccines or a recent negative test to enter virtually all public spaces. If you want to go to a restaurant, bar, train station or concert, for example, you need to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative test. That is in the interest of public health -- and is exactly what we should be heading toward in the U.S. 
In the short time since France announced this mandate, vaccine appointments there have gone through the roof; the nation's websites for vaccine appointments almost shut down because of increased demand. The Biden administration should take a much more proactive, aggressive and consistent approach toward vaccination. Like France, we can do something similar together as a country, but the Biden administration really needs to get over its squeamishness about requiring proof of vaccination. 
Last Thursday, President Biden took an important step forward. He announced that all federal workers, including contractors, have a choice: either attest to being vaccinated or submit to weekly coronavirus testing, along with continued masking and social distancing. This is progress, and we've already seen businesses follow with similar requirements. Still, I'm disappointed that Biden is requiring only a voluntary attestation. Haven't we learned that the honor code is ineffective? When will his team finally get on board with vaccine verification? 
The Biden administration could go further, too, requiring that anyone on any form of public transportation in the U.S. or entering any federal building show proof of vaccination or a negative COVID-19 test. These moves would send a powerful signal to schools and other businesses that vaccine requirements are something they can and should be enacting as well for all who are eligible. 
I don't want to use the term ' vaccine passport,' which has a negative connotation that's inaccurate and imprecise. A passport is something you need to access government services and travel. What I'm talking about here is a health screening. Think of it as an E-Z Pass. To be in a public space, you need to show that you're unlikely to be carrying a contagious virus. You can show a recent negative test every time, and be tested twice a week. Or, if you want to circumvent this process, you show proof of vaccination. It's the TSA pre-check -- you can go faster through the line if you have this vaccine verification. Imagine if such a program were announced now. Vaccinations would rapidly speed up. Without such a system, we're really just tinkering around the edges. 
Vaccine mandates are not novel. We require kids to receive a whole host of childhood immunizations to attend school. We haven't had a case of polio spread in the U.S. since the 1970s. But we still routinely vaccinate our children for polio because we don't want any cases to occur going forward. Why should COVID-19 be any different? 
COVID-19 has been politicized in a way that other illnesses have not. Dr. Anthony Fauci recently said that had there been this degree of misinformation and disinformation with other vaccines throughout history, we might still have measles, polio and smallpox today. 
As a society, we have an obligation to safeguard one another. Yes, you get vaccinated to protect yourself -- but you also get vaccinated to protect those around you. And we do this in order to control or eradicate diseases that ravage our population. It's the ultimate act of selfishness to decide that your individual decision must take precedence over the literal life and death of the people around you.

2021-08-05,Opinion: Why COVID-19 Vaccines Should Be Required for All Americans,,"By Gilbert Berdine, MD*
Figure 1 below illustrates the daily mortality attributed to covid-19 in Sweden, New York, Illinois, and Texas. The figure plots the daily number of deaths per million population. This figure illustrates the rise and fall of deaths from covid-19 in four different policy environments. The data were obtained from Worldometer.
Sweden: The Control Group
Sweden (blue dots) has served as a control group to compare policies intended to decrease deaths from covid-19. Sweden has been unfairly criticized for its policy despite having an outcome more favorable than places with authoritarian lockdown policies. Sweden did not close its schools. Other than stopping gatherings of more than fifty people, the Swedish government left decisions of closing businesses, using masks, and social distancing to the Swedish people. The government encouraged the use of masks and social distancing, but there were no requirements and there were no penalties for those who declined to follow the advice. Mortality attributed to covid-19 hit a peak value of 11.38 deaths per day per million population on April 8, 2020. This mortality was matched on April 15, and mortality has decreased since then.
Daily mortality has been less than one death per day per million population for the previous eighteen days. Cases are very low. For all practical purposes, the covid-19 epidemic is over in Sweden. Almost certainly herd immunity has been achieved in Sweden irrespective of any antibody test results. Testing is usually only for IgG antibody and the herd can become immune via IgA antibody or cellular mechanisms that are not detected by the usual testing. Whether covid-19 will reappear this next fall or winter remains to be seen.
New York: Locking the Barn Door Shut after the Horse Has Already Left
New York (brown dots) has been a catastrophe. On March 20, 2020, a fulllockdownwas implemented. Nonessential businesses were ordered to close. Workers in nonessential businesses were ordered to work only from home. Pharmacies, grocery stores, liquor stores, and wine stores were deemed to be essential and allowed to remain open. Restaurants and bars could only deliver to homes. In addition to the lockdown,nursing homeswere ordered on March 25, 2020, to accept patients positive for the covid-19 virus in transfer from hospitals. On May 10, this order was changed such that patients had to test negative for the virus before being transferred to nursing homes, but the damage had already been done. By April 7, 2020, within threeweeks of the nursing home order, a daily mortality of over fifty deaths per day per million population had been reached. This daily mortality rate was almost five times the peak rate observed in Sweden, where no lockdown was implemented.
The New York policy assumed that all human interactions carry the same risk of death by covid-19. The New York data clearly shows that interactions among young and healthy people have a much different risk than interactions between the young and elderly and interactions among the elderly. By facilitating the transmission of the virus from hospitals to nursing homes, the rate of spread within the elderly population was maximized, and any possible benefit from lockdown of the young and healthy population was rendered moot. The general population was kept locked down after the virus had been broadly disseminated among the elderly population. The decline of deaths from the peak levels in New York, with its harsh lockdown, has followed roughly the same time course as what has been observed in Sweden without any lockdown. It is unclear whether the lockdown interfered with herd immunity or not. This will not be known until after the economy and schools are completely reopened for at least a month.
Illinois: A Flattened Curve Led to More Deaths
Illinois (gray dots) has more subtle differences from Sweden than does New York. Illinois also implemented a harshlockdownon March 20, 2020. There was no nursing home order as in New York. The daily mortality rate increased more slowlythan it did in New York and Sweden, reaching a peak of over fifteen deaths per day per million population on May 17, 2020. The daily mortality has declined more slowly than it did in New York and Sweden, and it remains significantly higher than the rates in those places. The most likely explanation for the Illinois data is that the lockdown didindeedslow the rate of transmission among the young and healthybut also allowed a longer time for transmission from young people to elderly people. The lockdown appears to have made more deaths from covid-19 in Illinois than would have occurred without it. Almost certainlyherd immunity has not been achieved and will not be achieved until the schools and economy are reopened.
Texas: The Ox Is Slow, but the Earth Is Patient
Texas (gold dots) had very few deaths following a less harsh lockdown than was implemented in New York and Illinois. Nonessential businesses wereclosedon March 31. Outdoor activities were permitted. Social distancing was advised but not required. Governor Abbott was criticized for not squeezing hard enough, but predictions that Texas health care would be overwhelmed by late April failed to materialize. Texas appeared to be a success story, with a much lower mortality, and the state began a phasedreopeningof the economy on May 1, 2020. By late June, however, cases of covid-19 were increasingand the daily mortality rate was creeping up. The general reopening was paused, and some relaxations of measures were rescinded on June 26, 2020. The Texas daily mortality rate hit a peak of over ten deaths per day per million population on July 31, 2020. The Texas mortality peak is almost bad as the peak rate seen in Sweden, but Texas still has a largely closed economy. Texans are debating whether schools should be reopened or not. Sweden does not have to worry about its schools, because it never closed its schools. Texas will eventually have to reopen its schools and economy. It would appear that covid-19 deaths were deferred rather than prevented by the lockdown. Although the overall covid-19 mortality is lower in Texas (293 deaths per million population) than in Sweden (570), the current daily mortality in Texas is much higher than in Sweden, so covid-19 mortality in Texas may catch up to Sweden over the next 30–60 days. Furthermore, the situation in Texas will likely get worse when the schools and economy are reopened, as they eventually must be. Like the ox and the Earth, the lockdown slowed the transmission of the virus among the young and healthy, but the virus appears to be very patient and will spread when it is able to.
Conclusions
The data suggest that lockdowns have not prevented any deaths from covid-19. At best, lockdowns have deferred death for a short time, but they cannot possibly be continued for the long term. It seems likely that one will not have to even compare economic deprivation with loss of life, as the final death toll following authoritarian lockdowns will most likely exceed the deaths from letting people choose how to manage their own risk. After taking the unprecedented economic depression into account, history will likely judge these lockdowns to be the greatest policy error of this generation. Covid-19 is not going to be defeated; we will have to learn how to coexist with it. The only way we can learn how best to cope with covid-19 is to let individuals manage their own risk, observe the outcomes, and learn from mistakes. The world owes a great debt to Sweden for setting an example that the rest of us can follow.

2020-08-18,Why Americans Should Adopt The Sweden Model On COVID-19 – OpEd,,"Oct 22, 2020( The Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting: http://investigatemidwest.org Delivered by Newstex) ; As COVID-19 unrelentingly spread across the U.S. this summer it has become abundantly clear that our agricultural system - from farm to fork - can't handle a pandemic. The novel corona-virus exposed huge cracks in food processing and delivery that must be addressed by Congress.Food shortages. Food that did not reach consumers due to an overwhelmed transportation system. Panic and hoarding at the retail-level Massive milk, egg, and vegetable food waste. The inability to reroute food destined for closed restaurants into the consumer supply chain. The headaches were endless.No one along the food distribution system was spared from COVID-19. Farmers (especially those who produce perishable products), meat processors/packers, and restaurants all were impacted.Down on the farm producers of onions, milk, eggs, and pork found themselves with no place to sell their wares: 
http://eepurl.com/bJif3h; In April the Dairy Farmers of America estimated dairy farmers were daily dumping up to 3.7 million gallons of milk onto fields. While the dumping of milk has actually been going on in the U.S for decades due to overproduction and lower consumer consumption, COVID 19 created bottlenecks for the milk supply. The government mandated closure of schools, coffee shops, ice cream stands shrunk milk demand even further.Onions were also left to rot or composted by farmers who lost restaurant sales. Restaurants account for roughly 40 percent of all onion sales with a specialized market for large mild onions used to make rings. Meanwhile, egg producers were smashing roughly three-quarters of a million eggs every week. The tightening egg supply and surge in demand at retail pushed the cost of eggs over 3 dollars a dozen in March.COVID-19 hit beef and poultry processing plants especially hard. See here, here, and here. Big Meat and the federal government responded too slowly to the rapid spread of the corona-virus. The meat processing slowdown forced some poultry farmers to euthanize their birds. Two million in Delaware and Maryland. One and a half million in North Carolina. Two hundred thousand in Pennsylvania.For pork producers COVID 19 meat packing slowdowns left them cramming piglets into already full barns, turning them out into open fields, or in desperate measure facing the difficult decision to euthanize.But it's even more complicated than simple supply/demand economics. Here in the good ol U-S-of-A producers more often than not send their agricultural products specifically to either the food-service chain (places like restaurants, schools, hospitals, hotels, stadiums, and movie theaters) or the grocery retail chain.Products are specifically produced to meet the needs of each supply chain. Food designed for the food-service chain is often packaged in super-sized bulk. For example, lettuce is often sold in bulk shipping crates to the food-service chain, while individualized wrapped packing is often needed for consumer sale (pre-packaged mixes account for about 25 percent of all iceberg lettuce sold at retail).Another bottleneck concerns FDA mandated labeling of products heading to the grocery vs. the food-service industry. The FDA did waive some of its labeling requirements in March due to COVID-19 that gave restaurants the ability to sell some of their unprepared food to the public. But local communities including Boston and Los Angeles irrationally banned the process.And then there are issues surrounding transportation. Demand at the nation's food banks soared as COVID-19 left people without employment. Food waste could have been lessened had the federal government taken a more aggressive approach to buy and deliver surplus fruits and vegetables to food banks.In a nutshell, COVID-19 has wreaked havoc on food distribution chains. Lawmakers need to hold hearings on the impact of COVID-19 on food waste, especially as it relates to supply issues in food-service sector, and develop regulations to more nimbly handle unexpected food supply bottlenecks.

2020-10-22,Opinion: COVID-19 exposes weakness in U.S. food system,,"Australia's big co-operative and mutual enterprises grew strongly through the heart of the Covid pandemic and in the wake of natural disasters including bushfires and floods, with revenue up 10 per cent to $34.4bn in 2020-21. 
The top 100 businesses in the CME sector recorded average annual growth of 28.7 per cent in pre-tax earnings over a five-year period, with agribusiness, motoring and financial services the top performers, a new study shows.
Grain company CBH was the biggest co-op by turnover in 2020-21, at $3.9bn, with Queensland's Great Southern Bank the largest by gross assets at $16.3bn, the 2022 National Mutual Economy Report reveals.
The annual report, published by the Business Council of Co-operatives and Mutuals, concludes the sector, which reinvests profits into the business on behalf of members, has broadly bounced back after a difficult, Covid-affected 2019-20, with some exceptions.
""The combined turnover of the top 100 CMEs was $34.38bn, representing a 10 per cent increase in revenue over the previous year,"" it says.
""Significant increases in profitability for agribusiness co-operatives, mobility mutuals and financial services are juxtaposed by the performance of health insurance mutuals still experiencing volatility after two years of the ongoing health crisis,"" it says.
BCCM chief executive Melina Morrison said overall the CME sector had shown its resilience in recent challenging years, and was putting money back into the community.
""It is pleasing to see the sector rebound strongly despite the challenges posed by Covid-19 as well as recent climate-related disasters such as bushfires and flooding,"" Ms Morrison said.
""Time and again throughout recent crises, we have seen co-operatives and mutuals use their local knowledge and networks to find solutions that put members first, investing capital wisely to ensure the best outcomes for the communities they serve."" 
Co-operatives and mutuals are a significant component of the broader economy, with the 1832 enterprises having more than 31 million memberships, generating over $200bn in revenue and managing almost $1.3 trillion in assets. 
More than 73,000 people are employed in the sector.
A series of mergers and consolidations in recent years has seen the overall number of enterprises decline while the sector itself has continued to grow. 
Health insurers and motoring groups dominate the top 10 CMEs by turnover, with HCF, HBF, Australian Unity and Teachers Federation Health all in the list. So too are RACQ, RACV and RAC WA.
NRMA and AustralianSuper are the two largest CMEs by membership, with 2.72 million and 2.47 million members respectively. Banks dominate among the largest CMEs by assets, with Great Southern Bank, Heritage Bank, Bank Australia and Teachers Mutual Bank all in the top 10.
The NME report also used data from 67 of the major CMEs to gauge their contributions back into communities, finding 9.4 per cent of after-tax profits were reinvested into community projects such as education, health and welfare.
""Co-ops and mutuals make vital contributions by investing in their communities every day and this often goes unheralded,"" Ms Morrison said.
The report also notes that 17 per cent of the top 100 co-ops and mutuals had a female chief executive, up from just three per cent in 2016. Just five per cent of ASX200 companies currently have a female CEO, a percentage unchanged across the same time frame.

2022-06-16,Co-ops 'bounced back after Covid-19',,"It was November 17, 2019, when the first coronavirus patient AKA patient ""Zero"" was diagnosed in Wuhan hospital China, since then the word COVD-19, AKA Corona has become the word of terror. Initially, the world halted its trade with China and China being the major supplier of the world had to shut down all of its production. From Patient Zero to almost 80,000 patients China has suffered throughout. The entire international media was after China and it seems like the entire world started a boycott with China. I remember our discussion within my acquaintances almost everyone was making statements which can be categorized into:
America is after China to destroy China's economy with the help of international media ( The so-called Economists)They eat all sorts of animals like Bats, Cats Snakes, etc. (the Religious Block)
Needless to say within 4 months the virus has spread over 203 countries and territories around the world and 2 international conveyances: the Diamond Princess Cruise ship harbored in Yokohama, Japan, and Holland America's MS Zaandam cruise ship. So be it land or sea the virus is everywhere. Total cases in Iran are almost half of China's but they do not eat bats, rats, snakes, etc., and if America was after Iran and China both then the cases in America alone are more than 103,000 registered patients. In the month of March, the same acquaintance is talking about something different that China has created the virus why? Because China has fully controlled the virus spread within China and also because they purchased 30% - 40% shared of EU companies. Now China will benefit in the longer run.
Let's examine what happened in China.
How: How they controlled the virus?Why not: Why not take benefit of the current slump in stocks.
How they have controlled the virus?
We all know that China implemented a complete lockdown within its cities to control the virus spread but the question is:
Does complete lockdown serve the purpose if so how?What China did during the lockdown?
China is a nation with the most advance and sophisticated technology implemented within its country. Chinese use big data analytics combines with Artificial Intelligence to forecast and monitor most of their operations. The COVID – 19 started spreading. China halted its operations and started analyzing the trends through big data analytics.
Most of the Chinese use We Chat Pay for their purchasing and groceries in stores. This application is linked with banking wallets enabling them to use funds from banks. So let's say a person ""A"" who was diagnosed with COVID-19 on 1st February 2020, his transactions were analyzed for the last 2 weeks. The roads he/she used people he/she interacted with etc.
Based on these analyses the system identified and flagged people in three color codes. The interesting part is every individual was informed through an application about their rights and rating:
Flag
Description
Action
Red
Patient who is diagnosed with COVID – 19 and his/her immediate family members
Complete isolation and treatment, family members to be quarantined.
Yellow
A person who had an interaction with infected person or his/her family member.
Quarantined and not allowed for driving only basic groceries shopping
Green
The one who never had any interaction or his family members with infected ones.
Allowed to go out only for groceries and drive only if required.
One person from every household was allowed to go out of their houses once in 3 days that too only for basic groceries only if they have green/ yellow rating. Now when they knew who to focus and the entire virus spread is structured and once something is structured it is easy to control.
Why not: Why not take benefit of the current slump in stocks:
Once China has made it structured and started deputing the right people at the right jobs, the entire world started to suffer from the same. The economy started falling and the world does not know what to do but China knows. China started extending help to send doctors and in the meantime, the thinking heads started focusing on how to make the Chinese economy strong. They started investing and buying shares. Why wouldn't they?
If you want to see who will benefit from any situation you monitor the past and future economic transactions remember the 911 incident the owner of the world trade center insured his buildings a few weeks before the incident happened. Right after the pandemic situation China invested but who invested before the spread?
China started investing in the world's economy and resulting in having 30% - 40% of shares for a few EU companies. This will benefit China in the longer run. China, Russia, and Pakistan have already started working on building an alliance. The future is not far when the new economic giants will emerge into the world's economy with their own currency.
COVID-19 in our society:
Now let's come down to our society, we do not have such an organized system. Well, we have tried to implement a portion of it into the capital of Pakistan. Project Safe Islamabad during which street and road cameras were installed. One of my friends shared a story a few moments ago about a camera that was installed next to an intelligence agency office to detect concealed weapons. One fine evening a car smashed into the pole where the camera was installed and brought it to ground. Police came stayed there for 3 hours they have also called a special team to check the camera. That team took away the camera and waited till the pole is fixed but it was never fixed. A few weeks later there was no camera no pole either.
""It's not who we are underneath, but what we do that defines us."" -Rachel Dawes
Now ask yourself how we are going the control the situation:
By asking our people to stay at home who come outside to see if people are staying at home?By locking down an entire area with force as India did and then apologized?By putting the blame in Zairains of Iran?By putting blame on Tablighi Jamat?By doing what Hindu's did, Azan at 10 o clock at night (Not a single reference in Islam of such practice)?By creating a shortage of basic necessities?By making sanitizers at home and selling them at higher prices to make a profit?
Or simply by following what was told in our religion submission to the Almighty Allah (SWT). Repent on what we have done in the past and seek Allah (SWT) forgiveness. We have a choice, we have to make the right choice we have nothing but belief as Holy Prophet (PBHU) said:
The Prophet said, there is no disease that Allah has created, except that He also has created its treatment. - SAHIH BUKHARI HADITH NO. 5678 (Book of Medicine)

2021-07-06,"Best of BS Opinion: Point of vulnerability, Covid-19 vaccines, and more",,"""A person is not a believer who fills his stomach while his neighbour goes hungry"" (Hadith, Bukhari)
Qurbani, udhiyah in Arabic, means sacrifice, the act of sacrificing animals honours the Prophet Ibrahim's willingness to sacrifice his son Ismail in obedience to God. In this regard, every Eid-ul-Adha Muslims demonstrate their obedience to Allah through sacrificing animals or paying to have one slaughtered on their behalf. However, unfortunately, most of the Muslims perform the religious rituals to show off instead of keeping in mind the real essence of performing their religious duties. It is unfortunate to say that in several Muslims countries, most of the people observe Eid-ul-Adha as a ritual. In this regard, the sacrifice of the animals has become a symbol of showing off instead of religious duty to please God. There are very few Muslims who still sacrifice animals as a religious duty to please God. Moreover, people have also made this month as the source of earning money, for example, whenever Eid-ul-Adha comes closer, the prices of animals go high. Besides, people buy expensive animals because buying an expensive animal has become a fashion to show that they are wealthier than their neighbours or other people of society.
Looking over the prevailing situation amid Covid-19 pandemic, where the cases of Coronavirus have been increasing. Governments in most of the Muslims nations have prohibited the setting of cattle markets even though there are many chances of spread of Covid-19. Because the previous record of people about following the SOPs and instructions provided by the government did not seem reasonable where most of the people ignored SOPS, particularly in countries such as Pakistan. In this regard, gatherings of people over animal markets could cause a massive increase in coronavirus cases as well. It is not about 1, 2 or 3 days instead it is about an extended period because Coronavirus has been continuing for previous six months and no one has reached a conclusion that how much it will still last. Therefore, governments of all the Muslim nations have to think it over because this is not a normal time, where the whole world is suffering from the fatal disease in the form of Covid-19. Governments, along with the coordination and collaboration of religious scholars should form such policies from which most of the people affected by Coronavirus could take benefits for a long time.
Moreover, there is a dire need in societies like Pakistan to work over the minds of people to make them feel and act like sensible and responsible citizens. What lacks in young or even most of the generation is understanding and thinking about anything they have been doing since long as well as they are going to do. They do not even bother to think rationally over acts they are going to do; instead, they prefer stereotypes and traditional concepts which have been practiced in society since long. People consider the old concepts and practices as final and correct for all times, circumstances and situations instead of taking decisions and actions according to the prevailing situation based on rationality. This is a high time for these people to think rationally and make decisions after thinking over the prevailing situation because each action and decision taken by them could affect the whole society. As far as all religions are concerned, they also emphasize humanity and give lessons about doing things which are beneficial for human beings. The act of helping needy people is also much liked by God, and those people who think right and do better for the people are very near to God.
There are almost 50 Muslims-majority countries all over the world. All Muslims throughout the world spend a considerable amount of money on sacrificing animals on Eid-ul-Azha as a religious duty. In this regard, all scholars of Islamic law and jurisprudence should gather to discuss the current situation where the world has been going through the fatal disease in the form of Covid-19. Most of the poor and middle-class people have been suffering from challenging circumstances because of lockdown amid Coronavirus. Additionally, there is also a need to look over the scientific point of view if this time the sacrifice of animals is made in a limited way or most of the amount spent on animal sacrifice should be spent on poor people then could this pose any harms to humans or society or not? If there is any space within religion as well as science to spend this massive amount of money on low-income families who are suffering from severe financial crisis amid the current situation instead of spending it over animals sacrifice. Then the scholars of Islam should take the collective decision that is most beneficial mainly for the poor people and generally for the whole society.

2020-07-19,Eid-Ul-Adha Sacrificial Money Should Be Spent On Poor People Amid Covid-19 – OpEd,,"Early signs are that the COVID-19 virus poses a greater direct health risk to men, and particularly older men. But the pandemic is exposing and exploiting inequalities of all kinds, including gender inequality. In the long term, its impact on women's health, rights and freedoms could harm us all.
Women are already suffering the deadly impact of lockdowns and quarantines. These restrictions are essential – but they increase the risk of violence towards women trapped with abusive partners. Recent weeks have seen an alarming global surge in domestic violence; the largest support organization in the UK reported a 700 percent increase in calls. At the same time, support services for women at risk face cuts and closures.
This was the background to my recent appeal for peace in homes around the world [link]. Since then, more than 143 governments have committed to supporting women and girls at risk of violence during the pandemic. Every country can take action by moving services online, expanding domestic violence shelters and designating them as essential, and increasing support to frontline organizations. The United Nations' partnership with the European Union, the Spotlight Initiative [link], is working with governments in more than 25 countries on these and similar measures, and stands ready to expand its support.
But the threat to women's rights and freedoms posed by COVID-19 goes far beyond physical violence. The deep economic downturn accompanying the pandemic is likely to have a distinctly female face.
The unfair and unequal treatment of working women is one reason why I went into politics. In the late 1960s, as a student volunteer doing social work in poor areas of Lisbon, I saw women in very difficult situations, doing menial jobs and carrying the weight of their extended families. I knew this had to change – and I have seen important change in my lifetime.
But decades later, COVID-19 threatens to bring back these conditions and worse, for many women around the world.
Women are disproportionately represented in poorly paid jobs without benefits, as domestic workers, casual labourers, street vendors, and in small-scale services like hairdressing. The International Labour Organization estimates that nearly 200 million jobs will be lost in the next three months alone – many of them in exactly these sectors.
And just as they are losing their paid employment, many women face a huge increase in care work due to school closures, overwhelmed health systems, and the increased needs of older people.
And let's not forget the girls who have had their education cut short. In some villages in Sierra Leone, school enrolment rates for teenage girls fell from 50 to 34 percent after the Ebola epidemic, with lifelong implications for their wellbeing and that of their communities and societies. 
Many men, too, are facing job losses and conflicting demands. But even at the best of times, women do three times as much domestic work as men. That means they are more likely to be called on to look after children if businesses open while schools remain closed, delaying their return to the paid labour force.
Entrenched inequality also means that while women make up seventy percent of healthcare workers, they are vastly outnumbered by men in healthcare management, and comprise just one in every ten political leaders worldwide – which harms us all. We need women at the table when decisions are taken on this pandemic, to prevent worst-case scenarios like a second spike in infections, labour shortages, and even social unrest.
Women in insecure jobs urgently need basic social protections, from health insurance to paid sick leave, childcare, income protection and unemployment benefits. Looking ahead, measures to stimulate the economy, like cash transfers, credits, loans and bailouts, must be targeted at women – whether they are working full-time in the formal economy, as part-time or seasonal workers in the informal economy, or as entrepreneurs and business owners.
The COVID-19 pandemic has made it clearer than ever that women's unpaid domestic labour is subsidizing both public services and private profits. This work must be included in economic metrics and decision-making. We will all gain from working arrangements that recognize people's caring responsibilities, and from inclusive economic models that value work in the home.
This pandemic is not only challenging global health systems, but our commitment to equality and human dignity.
With women's interests and rights front and centre, we can get through this pandemic faster, and build more equal and resilient communities and societies that benefit everyone.

 As COVID-19 sweeps across Papua New Guinea, one fact is clear: vaccination rates need to rise. There are a range of reasons why so few people have been vaccinated to date. Supply was limited at first, and threadbare health infrastructure has hampered the rollout since. But one impediment has become increasingly obvious: many people are hesitant about being vaccinated. 
 Starting in May this year, along with counterparts, I've been involved in research on attitudes to COVID-19 vaccinations in Papua New Guinea. The work included a large, broadly nationally-representative phone survey (run in late May and June) on attitudes to COVID-19 vaccinations. The research also included a large online survey experiment in June and July to see what information, if any, could change attitudes about vaccines. In a country like PNG, phone surveys and online experiments are imperfect tools. But face-to-face surveys are difficult and expensive and, with a need for speed, our approach was the best alternative. What's more, using phone tower information to ensure good geographical coverage, along with survey weights derived from the most recent Demographic and Health Survey and census ensured the resulting data were as representative as possible. 
 All of the methods are covered in full in a recent World Bank discussion paper[1]. The results I'm going to write about today, and more, are also covered in detail in the paper. In this post I'm going to provide my take on the findings, in the form of bad news, good news, and a possible pathway forwards. 
 The bad news is striking. Less than one in five respondents to the phone survey who were aware a vaccine existed said they were planning on being vaccinated. 

To learn more, participants who weren't planning on being vaccinated were asked why. There were many possible responses - including answers involving logistics and cost. In practice though, most of the people who said they weren't planning on being vaccinated were sceptical, or frightened of, the vaccine itself. 

Although a lot has been said[2] about online misinformation over the course of the pandemic in PNG, the phone survey participants' vaccine hesitancy doesn't seem to have come directly from the internet. Only a small proportion of phone survey respondents said they used the internet for health information. And there was no correlation between people's trust in information from the internet and whether they planned on being vaccinated against COVID-19. Internet misinformation might still be affecting people's views about vaccines indirectly in PNG, with rumours starting online before subsequently being propelled by word of mouth. But the internet on its own doesn't seem to be the primary vector of vaccine aversion. 
 The good news is that even though most of the respondents to the phone survey said they weren't planning on being vaccinated, or were uncertain, when asked who might change their mind, their replies offered some hope they were open to reconsidering. Their responses also made it clear whose recommendations they trusted first and foremost: health workers. 

On top of this, in the online survey experiment we found that even very basic information such as statements about the vaccine's safety and the danger of COVID-19 could increase people's inclination to be vaccinated. The information provided was simple, and participants only got to read it once. It's unlikely to be as influential as a conversation with a trusted health professional. Yet, even so, telling people the vaccine was safe and COVID-19 dangerous increased the share of respondents who said they were planning to be vaccinated by over 10 percentage points. Some of the other information tried in the experiment didn't affect people's views (more details are in the paper) so messages do need to be carefully thought through. But the good news is that it's possible to change views about COVID-19 vaccinations in PNG by giving people the facts. 

There is much more information in the paper[3]. Taken together, the findings point to a pathway forward for PNG as it strives to reduce vaccine hesitancy: provide simple information about the safety of the vaccine and the dangers of COVID-19. And do this through local health workers wherever possible.

2022-01-25,"Full Video Discussion of Ron Johnson Panel, COVID-19 A Different Opinion",,"How are you supposed to wash your hands regularly if you have no running water or soap? How can you implement 'social distancing' if you live in a slum or a refugee camp? How are you supposed to stop crossing borders if you are fleeing from war? How are those with pre-existing health conditions going to take extra precautions if they already can't afford or access the treatment they need?
Everyone is affected by the COVID-19 pandemic, but the impact may be felt by some more than others.
As coronavirus disease COVID-19 spreads further, it will continue to expose the inequalities that exist in our health systems. It will expose the exclusion of certain groups from accessing care, either because of their legal status or because of other factors that make them a target of the state. It will expose the under-investment in free public healthcare for all, which means that access to quality care will for some be based on purchasing power and not medical need. It will expose the failure of governments - not just health services - to plan for and deliver services that meet the needs of everyone. It will expose the life-threatening vulnerabilities caused by displacement, violence, poverty and war.
The people who will especially suffer will be those already neglected - due to austerity measures, who have fled because of war, who don't have access to treatment for existing conditions because of privatised healthcare. And it will also be those who can't stock up on food because they already can't afford a meal every night of the week, who are underpaid, overworked and deprived of sick leave, unable to work from home - and those trapped in conflict zones under bombing and siege.
And how are you supposed to treat patients without all the material that you need? Many health systems bracing for the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic have already been hammered to breaking point by war, political mismanagement, under-resourcing, corruption, austerity and sanctions. They are already barely able to cope with normal patient loads.
COVID-19 is demonstrating how policy decisions of social exclusion, reduced access to free healthcare, and increased inequality will now be felt by all of us. These policies are the enemy of our collective health.
There are decisions that can be taken now that will already ease the impending disaster that many communities may soon face. Jonathan Whittal, MSF Director of Analysis
As MSF scales up our response to the coronavirus COVID-19 pandemic, we will focus on the most vulnerable and neglected. We started working in Hong Kong earlier this year in response to the first cases of COVID-19, and we now have medical teams deployed to respond in the heart of the pandemic in Italy. We will continue to scale up as much as is feasible as this crisis spreads.
However, there are decisions that can be taken now that will already ease the impending disaster that many communities may soon face. The congested camps on the Greek islands need to be evacuated. That doesn't mean sending people back to Syria where war still rages. It means finding a way to integrate people into communities where they will be able to practice safety measures such as social distancing and self-isolation.
In addition to this, supplies need to be shared across borders according to where the needs are the greatest. This needs to start with states in Europe sharing their supplies with Italy. It will soon need to extend to other regions that will be hit by this pandemic and whose ability to cope is already compromised.
I hope COVID-19 not only teaches us to wash our hands, but makes governments understand that healthcare must be for all.
As MSF, we will also need to manage the gaps we will face in staffing our other ongoing emergency projects. Our medical response to measles in DRC needs to continue. So too does our response to the emergency needs of the war-affected communities of Cameroon or the Central African Republic. These are just some of the communities we cannot afford to let down. For them, COVID-19 is yet another assault on their survival.
This pandemic is exposing our collective vulnerability. The powerlessness felt by many of us today, the cracks in our feeling of safety, the doubts about the future. These are all the fears and concerns felt by so many in society who have been excluded, neglected or even targeted by those in positions of power.
I hope COVID-19 not only teaches us to wash our hands, but makes governments understand that healthcare must be for all.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); HEALTH CARE ACCESS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (90%); MEDICAL CHARITIES (90%); NEGATIVE NEWS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); REFUGEES (90%); RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS (90%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (90%); VULNERABLE HEALTH POPULATIONS (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWS (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (78%); PRIVATIZATION (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); REFUGEE & RELIEF CAMPS (78%); SOCIAL ISOLATION (78%); DISPLACED PERSONS (77%); SLUM DWELLINGS (77%); VIRUSES (75%); HOME BASED EMPLOYMENT (73%); BOMBINGS (72%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (72%); NEGATIVE MISC NEWS (70%); SICK LEAVE (67%); International Organizations and Africa (%); Aid and Assistance (%); NGOs and Civil Society (%); Health and Medicine (%)

2020-03-20,Vulnerable Communities Are Bracing for Impact of Covid-19 [opinion],,"Mar 11, 2021( Pennsylvania Capital-Star: https://www.penncapital-star.com Delivered by Newstex)  (Photo via The Iowa Capital Dispatch[1]) By Dairyn Ortiz and Yecika Ramirez Essential. This is a word that many have heard of late in the face of one of America's biggest and gravest challenges, the COVID-19 pandemic. Our healthcare heroes have worked tirelessly in the battle against Covid-19 on the frontlines at hospitals, nursing homes and community clinics. 
These workers have saved many lives and keep communities safe. They truly have earned access to vaccines for their health, safety and that of their patients and families. We, and our co-workers, are also on the frontlines. We may not be visible, but every day, we help to feed Pennsylvanians. We make sure that our grocery stores are stocked. We process and package the food that sits on the dining room table. We work hard each day to ensure that the food supply chain remains alive and well in our state and nation. We are both members of the United Food &#38; Commercial Workers Local 1776. And we are among the 20,000 + grocery store and pharmacy workers, and the 10,000 food processing workers that our Local represents across the state. We have seen many of our co-workers fall ill or, in some instances, die from Covid-19. Their memories are not lost, and we keep their families in our prayers. Still, despite the risks, our fellow members continue to come to work every day to ensure that food is being produced for our communities. But we need help. On behalf of all of our co-workers, we are writing to publicly urge Gov. Tom Wolf and acting Health Secretary Alison Beam to take appropriate measures to make sure that food processing and packinghouse workers are prioritized for the COVID-19 vaccine. Meatpacking plants have been deadly COVID-19 hot spots - but policies that encourage workers to show up sick are legal[2]We have been very successful in working with employers across our entire Union to enhance safety measures and protocols at our worksites, including our own. We have worked hard, as have the vast majority of employers, to secure Personal Protective Equipment for workers and to institute important safety protocols to mitigate the spread of COVID-19. At many worksites, it was necessary to make significant changes to production areas to help prevent the spread of this deadly virus to allow for proper social distancing. Lalo en espaol: Las personas de trabajo que ponen comida en nuestra mesa necesitan la vacuna COVID-19 ya | Opinion[3]Our union was very pleased when Wolf rightly classified all of these workers as essential. The governor was right to classify grocery stores, pharmacies and food processing/packinghouse as lifesaving businesses. But these businesses cannot remain open without the very workers, like ourselves, that keep them operating. We know from our own experiences that our fellow workers are taking an enormous risk every day. A new study by the University of Pennsylvania confirms what we already know about our work; that essential workers have a 55 percent higher chance of contracting COVID-19 than members of the general public. The study also found that our family members have a 17 percent higher chance of contracting the virus. Now, because of the work of so many scientists and researchers, we can see a light at the end of this dark tunnel. Our nation was key to developing and purchasing millions of COVID-19 vaccines for distribution. Yet, still, we are waiting for this important resource to protect essential workers like ourselves. We take pride in nourishing America and benefiting our communities. We are proud to hold good-paying jobs that benefit all Pennsylvanians and our local economies. But we are also painfully aware of the fact that COVID-19 is still a threat. This virus continues to wreak havoc in our communities and among our co-workers and their families. For the sake of ourselves, our families and our communities, we need to have access to COVID-19 vaccines now.

2021-03-11,Workers who put the food on your tables need the COVID-19 vaccine now | Opinion,,"The following information was released by the office of the Minister for Defence of Australia:
COVID-19 is creating unprecedented challenges for our defence industry.
It is now more important than ever that we look at what are the best options available to address cash flow pressures on small businesses.
That is why I am holding weekly teleconferences with defence industry companies, advocates and senior departmental officials so I can hear first-hand the challenges being experienced, and support the small businesses in our defence industry.
Just recently, we announced plans to fast-track payments to defence-industry companies to help them to deal with COVID-19. More than $1.6 billion in payments has been brought forward so far to ensure money is flowing into the Australian economy.
We are also working to identify Defence projects which could be brought forward to help stimulate work in our small business sector.
Small businesses remain the driving force of our defence industry and I will explore any and all options to help them through this difficult time.
It's important we support our defence industry, because we're embarking on the nation's largest-ever build-up of military capability.
There are businesses right around Australia who are contributing to major projects for our Defence Force.
And now more than ever, we need to provide them with a more robust Defence system that offers small business greater certainty and opportunities in our major Defence programs.
After 100 days as Defence Industry Minister, I completed a review into my own portfolio area and arrived at five key priorities.
I have asked the Secretary and the Chief of the Defence Force to deliver a series of action items based on these priorities, with the overall goal being to maximise Australian industry involvement in Defence projects.
These priorities include:
Enhance CASG performance delivery to be a 'strong client'.
Expand small business access to Defence.
Increase the number of exporting Australian businesses.
Build Australia's skilled defence industry workforce.
Ensuring Defence's grants, innovation, science and technology programs are contributing to enhance ADF capability.
As part of my first and second priorities, I will strengthen the Australian Industry Capability (AIC) program so that Defence offers greater assurances and opportunities to the small business community into the future.
The AIC program was designed to meet key objectives in our 2016 Defence Industry Policy Statement.
At its crux, this policy statement identified the need to reset the partnership between Defence and industry to improve the delivery of Defence capability and to maximise opportunities for Australian businesses.
Since then, we have seen tremendous success.
Recently, it was a pleasure to join Luerssen Australia in Perth to recognise the outstanding participation of some 100 Australian small businesses directly contributing to the build of our twelve Offshore Patrol Vessels.
Luerssen is exceeding its 60 per cent AIC target, currently achieving 62.7 per cent of contract spend in Australian industry. It is Government investment in Defence programs such as the OPVs that is creating more opportunities for small business and delivering more Australian jobs.
I believe we can and should do more in backing small business and open new opportunities, as we continue to invest in defence capabilities.
Through my many engagements with small defence businesses, I have listened to their issues, and I am working hard to support them on these.
As I announced in February, our Government will incorporate greater protections for small business and strengthen existing AIC policy.
That is why I will deliver an Independent AIC Audit program.
This program will make CASG a stronger client, it will protect small business interests and hold the major contractors to account on their Australian Industry Capability obligations.
Defence will dedicate additional resources to support this program and ensure small business remains front and centre in acquisition and sustainment programs.
Our newly-appointed head of AIC within CASG, Martin Halloran, will lead the consultation process and engage with industry groups and small business to hear more of your thoughts as to what this audit program should look like.
I have also asked Defence to establish a new AIC contractual framework.
The current AIC framework has laid strong foundations to support small business in our major programs including LAND400, OPVs, Future Frigate and the Future Submarine programs.
However, I recognise that we need to go further in our support for small business by offering more guarantees of local content in our defence programs moving forward.
As a result, I will establish a mandated set of contractual terms that are consistently applied to all CASG contracts requiring an AIC plan.
This new framework will build on the existing policies of the Morrison Government and will encompass greater accountability, enforcement and stronger contractual terms to ensure Australian small businesses continue to be the backbone of this industry. This framework is not just nice to have, it is critical for the creation of a sovereign industrial capability.
The Australian defence industry is remarkably capable of delivering innovative and cutting edge technology and capability crucial to our Defence Force.
Barratt Communications, Sea-to-Summit and JFD Australia are just a handful of Western Australian small businesses our Defence Force has relied on to provide capability.
However, we need to look to the new frontier of support for small business and the changes I announced recently is that next big step.
Because when I take off my Minister hat and put on my local MP hat, I want to look my community in the eye and say I'm doing everything I can to bring regional Australia to the table.
And now with the growing challenges faced by the Australian defence industry during COVID-19, these changes to AIC will ensure small businesses are provided with more opportunities to compete for Defence work and certainty that major contractors will be held to account on the delivery of these opportunities to small businesses.
I will continue to work hard for you and leave no stone unturned to support you during COVID-19 and ensure there continues to be opportunities in defence industry for you now and into the future.","SMALL BUSINESS (91%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); DEFENSE SPENDING (90%); DEFENSE DEPARTMENTS (89%); DEFENSE SECTOR PERFORMANCE (89%); BUSINESS NEWS (78%); COMMERCE DEPARTMENTS (78%); COMPANY ACTIVITIES & MANAGEMENT (78%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (78%); SMALL BUSINESS ASSISTANCE (78%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (69%)

2020-04-15,OPINION PIECE - COVID-19 AND AIC,,"OTTAWA - The Canadian Armed Forces is postponing the deployment of a warship and surveillance aircraft to help enforce United Nations' sanctions against North Korea because of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The delay is one of numerous changes the Armed Forces is making to its overseas missions following a detailed analysis of the roughly 20 operations that the military is either already conducting or which were due to begin in the coming months.
""We conducted a detailed analysis of our operations to determine whether further adjustments were required to protect our personnel while ensuring continuity for critical tasks,"" Forces' spokeswoman Capt. Leah Campbell said in an email.
""Following this review, we adjusted some of our operations. These adjustments range from delaying the deployment of some capabilities, to amending the number of CAF personnel deployed, to modifying the length of deployments while the risks of COVID-19 remain present.""
The new changes follow an earlier decision to withdraw Armed Forces members from Iraq, scale back Canada's military training mission in Ukraine and bring back several warships from different parts of the world.
They also come as the federal government is deploying the majority of the military's medical personnel to help with long-term care facilities in Quebec and Ontario that have been hit hard by COVID-19.
The Halifax-class frigate HMCS Calgary and a CP-140 Aurora patrol plane were scheduled to head across the Pacific this month, the latest iteration in Canada's ongoing contribution to the international effort to prevent North Korea from expanding its nuclear arsenal.
Yet Campbell said the deployment has been ""deferred"" for an unspecified amount of time.
The same is true for Canada's contribution of a C-130 Hercules transport plane to UN operations in Africa. The aircraft has been based out of Uganda for five days per month since late last year, carrying supplies, peacekeepers and equipment to different missions in the region.
The Armed Forces has also suspended military training efforts in the West Bank, where it is helping the Palestinian Authority build its security forces, and relocated some troops from one area in South Sudan to another.
It has also curbed its support to a French counter-terrorism mission in West Africa, where Canada has been providing a heavy aircraft on an occasional basis to help transport troops and equipment, and cancelled plans to send military trainers to Niger this spring.
The military is also keeping troops on some missions in place longer, rather than replacing them with fresh Forces members as planned. Those include nine Canadian peacekeepers in the Democratic Republic of Congo, 10 in South Sudan, and 55 in the Sinai Peninsula.
""The decision to delay or adjust the number of personnel deployed on select missions was a balance between weighing the acceptable risk factors for our personnel, our ability to sustain the mission, and the impact any changes would have on the mission itself,"" Campbell said.
""For some operations, this decision is the result of a pause in operational activities by the host or partner nations. In others, it is preferable to delay the movement of forces in and out of missions at this time.""
The changes to overseas missions come as hundreds of Armed Forces members are preparing to work - or already working - in long-term care facilities in Ontario and Quebec that have been hit hard by COVID-19.
Defence Minister Harjit Sajjan last week said the military would have 1,350 service members in 25 long-term care facilities in Quebec by mid-May and another 265 in five institutions in Ontario.
Many other troops are currently remaining in their homes in case to stay healthy in case they are required to assist with spring flooding or wildfires across different parts of the country.

2020-05-10,"Canadian military postpones, curtails numerous overseas missions due to COVID-19 Forces postpone, curtail ops over COVID-19",,"Aug 26, 2020( The Center Square: Florida: https://www.thecentersquare.com/florida/Delivered by Newstex)  COVID-19 is motivating families to seek alternatives to their child's current schools and inspiring entrepreneurs to create new enterprises.Public and private school choice policies enacted in nearly every state over the last 30 years are facilitating this process.And governors are using states' new COVID-19 federal dollars to support families in their decisions and entrepreneurs in their work.Three newer school innovations parents are considering as alternatives are micro-schools, family PODS and virtual charter schools.Micro-schools reinvent the one-room schoolhouse. They create mixed-age groupings of 15 or fewer students that meet in homes, churches, community centers or workspaces. They use cutting edge technology with teachers - or other learning guides - employing different instructional approaches like place-based and experiential learning.Prenda, an Arizona-based national network of micro-schools, grew from 7 students in one neighborhood in 2018 to over 200 schools. 
Its website traffic increased 737 percent in June compared to June 2019.Prenda works with charter public schools to provide tuition free micro-schools. It also has private micro-schools that accept funds from Arizona's Education Savings Accounts program, allowing families to use public dollars for some private school costs.Another innovation is Parent Organized Discovery Sites - PODS. These, typically, engage three to six families with one teacher. In some PODS, parents teach, hiring a college student or other 'grown-up' to assist.Pandemic PODS combine tutoring and childcare. A Facebook post documents how 'within 48 hours thousands of parents [created] Facebook groups to formPODS.'Costs for 'podding' are supported using public dollars or directly charging parents, with some PODS providing scholarships for low-income families.The San Francisco school district will open 40 district-created PODS in libraries and community centers this school year.In Columbus, Ohio, the YMCA is offering learning PODS for students ages 5 to 16 who attend school virtually. Students begin as early as 6 a.m., with learning sessions beginning at 8 a.m.Another innovation is from the charter sector. Oklahoma's Epic Charter Schools is a virtual school enrolling 38,026 students. It's the largest school system in the state - surpassing Oklahoma City and Tulsa - adding up to 1,000 students a day.Students in Epic's online program have access to a $1,000 'learning fund' to use for everything from karate lessons to art classes. The school manages the money and parents choose from approved vendors.Florida Virtual School is a tuition-free state school that works nationwide with public, private, charter and homeschool families and school districts. It's seen an increase of 64,107 course requests in their Flex program since July 1, an increase of 93 percent. Full-time applications are up 5,738 requests over last year since March, a 177 percent increase.New enterprises also are being created.SitterStream offers babysitting and student tutoring, individually or in PODS. It has partnerships with small and large businesses, serving their employees. Amazon is one of their clients.Transportant makes 'school buses as smart as your phone.' It works with school districts, utilizing buses as rolling wi-fi hotspots that provide high speed internet services for an entire street or apartment building that don't have those services.Finally, the new federal pandemic CARES Act provides funds for governors to support innovative education programs and services.Oklahoma Gov. Kevin Stitt is using $30 million from the CARES Act's Governor's Emergency Education Relief Fund to create a $12 million 'Learn Anywhere Oklahoma' program so students access online content with a teacher; a $8 million 'Bridge the Gap' digital wallet program offering $1,500 to more than 5,000 low income families to purchase curriculum content, tutoring and technology; and a $10 million 'Stay in School' fund providing up to $6,500 to over 1,500 low income families with a pandemic-related job loss so children remain in their current private schools.Govs. Henry McMaster of South Carolina, Chris Sununu of New Hampshire, and Ron DeSantis of Florida announced similar programs for low-income families wanting to enroll their child in a private school.COVID-19 has turned school openings into disarray. But creative and determined parents, entrepreneurs and policy leaders are responding with impressive innovations and alternatives so learning can continue.","EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (99%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); EDUCATION SYSTEMS & INSTITUTIONS (90%); FAMILY (90%); PRIVATE SCHOOLS (90%); PUBLIC SCHOOLS (90%); STUDENTS & STUDENT LIFE (90%); BLOGS & MESSAGE BOARDS (89%); CHARTER SCHOOLS (89%); EDUCATION & TRAINING (89%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (89%); INTERNET SOCIAL NETWORKING (89%); ONLINE SCHOOLS (89%); SCHOOL DISTRICTS (89%); TUITION FEES (89%); HOME SCHOOLING (78%); EDUCATIONAL INSTITUTION EMPLOYEES (77%); ENTREPRENEURSHIP (77%); POOR POPULATION (77%); SCHOLARSHIPS & GRANTS (77%); STUDENT EXPENSES & FINANCING (77%); TEACHING & TEACHERS (77%); PRIMARY & SECONDARY SCHOOL TEACHERS (74%); ARTS & HUMANITIES EDUCATION (72%); EDUCATION REGULATION & POLICY (72%); EDUCATIONAL SAVINGS PLANS (72%); LEARNING THEORIES (72%); SCHOOL CHOICE (72%); ACADEMIC YEAR (71%); EMERGING TECHNOLOGY (70%); SPORTS INSTRUCTION (68%); LOW INCOME PERSONS (65%); CHILD CARE (50%); KARATE (50%)

2020-08-26,Op-Ed: COVID-19 parents seek new schooling options,,"Germany runs like clockwork - that was long the widely accepted cliche. Then came the coronavirus, and everything started crumbling. Zoran Arbutina says the wake-up call was long overdue.
It's rare that anyone from my home country of Croatia asks me about everyday life in Germany. For the longest time I thought this was just because they had enough problems of their own to worry about.
Then I realized that it actually came from their belief that they didn't have to ask because they knew enough about the country. To them - and many others around the world - Germany is a well-structured and organized country where everything works optimally. The people may be a bit reserved, but they are very disciplined. After all, it's common knowledge that German pedestrians stand and wait for the light to change before crossing deserted streets in the middle of the night.
Once in a while I will tell them that's not quite how it is - for instance, the fact that the only thing you can rely on railway operator Deutsche Bahn to be is late. But then they accuse me of exaggerating, calling me a naysayer.
Enter COVID-19
Until recently, even Germans believed the efficiency cliche. Then came the coronavirus crisis.
It started with face masks: When the decision to make them mandatory was finally made - after long, drawn-out debates about their usefulness - it became clear that there weren't enough of them available. Germany, the fourth-largest industrialized country on the planet, was then unable to secure enough supplies on global markets to make up for the shortfall. So people began sewing their own masks.
When schools closed down, it quickly became evident that almost none of them could meet the technical criteria required to offer online classes.
When the new academic year began in late summer, people saw - big surprise - that the virus was still there! But no one had thought to install ventilation systems while schools were empty.
The same goes for well-functioning Wi-Fi systems. Digital learning platforms in several states, for instance, crashed on the first day of online schooling after schools were again forced to close in December. Many laptops earmarked for students from low-income families often went undelivered - this to children already becoming the victims of a looming education-policy catastrophe.
Then came the vaccine disaster. True, the German company BioNTech was the first to offer an extremely effective coronavirus vaccine. The German government even funded the project - yet it failed to punctually order the doses it needed in sufficient quantities. The spectacular fumble segued straight into the country's poorly organized vaccination campaign: even with few doses available, many were left unused. Suddenly, Germans were looking at Serbia with envy.
Germany's delusional self-image
The latest fiasco is the confusion currently surrounding antigen tests. These were to be available in early March, before that date was pushed back. Now they're supposed to be available from mid-March. For free. But where? You can buy them at Aldi!
Now, if not before, the bitter truth is beginning to show through the veneer of the smug cliche. When I talk to Croatians these days, they tend to ask: ""What's with you guys over there?""
People in Germany, too, are wondering this with increasing disbelief. Their assessments of the situation range from ""not off to a smooth start,"" to ""disastrous"" and ""a total failure."" With each passing day, the splendid image the country had of itself is slowly melting away.
Digital detox with Deutsche Bahn
None of this is new. And this isn't just about Deutsche Bahn being the laughing stock of the nation for always running late. Take, for instance, one of the most common campaign promises in any German election: Digitalization is key to the country's future. Everyone can agree that we have to work hard to aggressively foster it - the problem is actually doing it.
When, five years ago, Chinese investors bought the robotics company Kuka - a world market leader in the field - there was a huge outcry about cutting-edge German technology being sold off to foreign competitors. What critics often failed to see was that Germany lacks sufficient infrastructure to use Kuka's technology to its full extent. To this day, the 5G broadband network needed to fuel Industry 4.0 is still in its infancy in Germany.
In Croatia, you have to head deep into the forests and first drive away the bears and wolves before you arrive at a place with no cell phone reception. In Germany, you just need to hop in the ICE high-speed train from Cologne to Munich. There are enough ""Funkl\xF6cher"" or ""dead spaces"" to make for an entirely relaxing trip: DB - offering digital detox with every business trip.
Getting back to the front of the pack
Many of Germany's public authorities still send data via fax (younger readers will want to Google that). The Bundeswehr - a NATO army - has difficulty communicating within its ranks because of the myriad of software used by different sections.
All of this is quite sobering for most Germans, because for them it is simply a given that Germany plays at the top of its class globally, whatever the discipline, be it building automobiles or playing soccer. Nevertheless, it doesn't seem right to overdramatize the situation either; a lot of things in Germany work better than in many places around the world. And the country is still playing in the big leagues, even if it isn't always at the front of the pack.
In order to get back there, Germany will have to drop the nice but, alas, fallacious illusion of itself as a world champion organizer. A reality check is really overdue, as is a realization that being seen as just ""normal"" isn't an insult. They started doing it abroad long ago.

2021-03-15,Germany : Opinion: COVID-19 challenges German efficiency cliche,,"We have long speculated on the moment when the shift of global leadership from the United States to China would take place. From Washington to Beijing for the political power, from New York to Shanghai for the economic one. It seems that we are witnessing it now.
Some saw the Beijing Olympics (2008) and especially its opening ceremony as an attempt by China to display this new reality. Others saw it later, with the creation of the Asian Investment and Infrastructure Bank (2015), as opposed to the Bretton Woods system (IMF and World Bank) that for decades has been a fundamental pillar of North American hegemony.
A certain truce came with Obama and Xi Jinping, with some sort of a de facto confirmation of a new bipolar global regime. A regime that, even if temporary, could punctually have some positive effects for global governance, such as the two leaders' pact on climate change that made the Paris Agreement feasible, also in 2015.
However, with the arrival of Trump and his ""Make America Great Again"", the escalation of this quarrel for global leadership increased in both speed and visibility. The most relevant examples, so far, are the trade war between the two countries -with the World Trade Organization as a hostage-; or the open battle over the control of 5G, with the Huawei controversy at its the core.
Others examples are less obvious to general opinion, but a matter of debate in specialised settings. An example is the full-fledged offensive that China has made to increase its presence and influence in the multilateral system. Obtaining important first-level positions, but also second level postings key to influence these institutions, in the face of the neglect of the early years of the Trump administration.
One case is that of Geneva, where the US administration has vacated for more than three years the position of ambassador of this key place, the city with most diplomatic activity in the world. Three long years has taken to the State Department to realize the space that China and other powers were gaining by taking advantage of the US ""empty seat"" policy.
They did so by appointing a new high political-profile ambassador in November last year. However, the positions of the battles for the future of the WTO or the leadership of the International Telecommunication Union (key in the management of satellite orbits, the management of radio space or digital world governance) were already well advanced at that time.
History is capricious, and again the unexpected ends up precipitating Copernican changes. No one expected the assassination of Archduke Francis Ferdinand in Sarajevo on June 28, 1914 with the chain of fatalities that would follow.
Nor could be expected that a clumsy press conference on the afternoon of November 9, 1989 would lead to the Berlin Wall immediate collapse; something that none of the Western intelligence agencies had anticipated.
Then, between November and the beginning of last December something happened in the Huanan market, in the city of Wuhan. It seems that the first case occurred on November 17. But it was not until December 31 that an ""outbreak of an unknown pneumonia"" in this city was reported to the World Health Organisation.
The Huanan market was closed down on January 1. The following day the new virus was confirmed, with the technical name of SARS-CoV-2. On January 16, Japan reported the first case, on the 17th, Thailand did.
The 21st was Taiwan and the United States. On the 24th, France reported the first three cases within the EU, the number of countries increased as the first border closures took place, especially in countries bordering China.
On January 30 the WHO declared an International Public Health Emergency, the same day that Italy reported its first case; the next day it was Spain at the same time that the virus was already spread in India, Russia, the Philippines or Australia. On March 11 the WHO declared the global pandemic and, while the world trembles, global leadership transits.
On March 20, while the White House or Downing Street were still flirting with denialism in relation to COVID-19, the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs announced a plan to support 82 countries in their fight against this virus.
Two weeks later, as the virus wreaked havoc on hospitals on both coasts in the United States, and the British Prime Minister was admitted to the ICU, 18 countries in central and western Africa had already received hundreds of tons of Chinese donations of medical supplies, and 17 more were waiting to receive them in a matter of days. Pakistan, South Korea, Spain or Italy are other countries that have received help. In the latter, this help was not only of material, but accompanied by experts and medical staff.
Putin's Russia also took advantage of the pandemic in the first weeks to project its role as international power; by sending military personnel to Italy - in a context of astonishing silence and blockage of the European institutions- or aid in health supplies to his ""friend"" Trump.
And even as COVID-19 spreads through Moscow and other cities and regions of the Federation these rather symbolic activities continue. Turkey also tried, by responding to Spain's NATO urgency request, but soon changed its policy once they realised how the situation was deteriorating in Ankara and Istanbul.
It is too early to evaluate the full scope of COVID-19. In fact, no one can really assert at this point what the evolution and global impact of the pandemic will be, neither in terms of public health, nor in its humanitarian, social or economic dimensions.
The outlook is not good, and particularly worrisome is the uncertain effect that this pandemic will have in less developed countries, considering how it is affecting higher-income ones.
However, it is quite clear that this will be a turning point in terms of global governance and hegemony. Once again, the arbitrariness of history precipitates change. The strategists, the intelligence agencies, the think tanks that for years have debated and conspired from Langley through Georgetown, Xijuan or Gouguan had not foreseen what would end up igniting in a provincial market in Wuhan.
But what does seems plausible is that, in the midst of such drama, we are witnessing the hanging over of global hegemony.","INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (89%); INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (89%); AGREEMENTS (78%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (78%); INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS & BODIES (78%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL TRADE (78%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (78%); INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (77%); MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN MOVEMENT (77%); POLITICS (77%); DEVELOPMENT BANKS (75%); CEASEFIRES (74%); CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICY (73%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (73%); PRESS CONFERENCES (73%); TRADE DISPUTES (66%); APPOINTMENTS (65%); INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (60%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (58%); United States, Canada and Africa (%); Asia, Australia, and Africa (%); Governance (%); International Organizations and Africa (%)

2020-04-10,Hegemony Shift in Times of COVID-19 [opinion],,"LAWRENCEVILLE, N.J., May 6 -- The National Guard issued the following news release:
The New Jersey National Guard teamed with active-duty Air Force and Coast Guard members and U.S. Northern Command civilians to form a joint operations center coordinating nearly 700 members of the Guard responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The JOC provides key leaders in the state with a constant flow of information to make decisions.
""We are essentially a liaison office between the Office of Emergency Management and the rest of the New Jersey National Guard,"" said Army Spc. Benjamin Castria, a full-time JOC member. ""We also receive requests from the National Guard Bureau down in Washington, D.C., asking for updates on what we're doing to support the COVID-19 response efforts.""
The JOC also receives requests from the New Jersey State Police and the New Jersey Department of Health, through the New Jersey Regional Operations and Intelligence Center, New Jersey's focal point for information-sharing to support law enforcement, counterterrorism and homeland security missions.
While JOC members normally operate out of the Homeland Security Center of Excellence in Lawrenceville, they had to get creative with the outbreak of COVID-19. To keep the mission going, the New Jersey National Guard JOC became the first JOC in the country to shift to 100% telework capabilities.
""For the first week, we operated the JOC remotely,"" said Army Master Sgt. Rene Sales, the noncommissioned officer in charge of the JOC. ""It offered a unique set of challenges, but we made the mission happen and kept everyone healthy.""
Even though staff members have returned, JOC personnel maintain social distancing by spreading out around the building.
Logistics experts, active duty liaison officers, medical officers, and intelligence analysts make up some of the JOC workforce.
""The joint effort has definitely been a beneficial and instrumental part of this operation,"" said Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Timothy Jardinico, the officer in charge of the joint directorate of intelligence and security. ""We get to see it from different perspectives, from all levels of the organization.""
Air Force Master Sgt. Kimberly Kaminski, a security forces Airman with the New Jersey Air National Guard's 108th Wing, has been acting as a liaison between the state's two Wings and the JOC.
""It's a whole different view,"" Kaminski said. ""To do missions like this means a lot to me. Humanitarian missions like this are a big part of why I enlisted. My family was affected by hurricanes Floyd and Irene, and the National Guard came out and helped us, so it feels good to be able to give back.""
Air Force Col. Mike Smith, deputy Title 10 commander assigned to U.S. Northern Command, said his team supports the dual-status commander, Air Force Brig. Gen. Wayne McCaughey, and the deployed forces throughout the state, including Army Reserve Soldiers with Urban Augmentation Medical Task Force 352-2. McGaughey is the director of the New Jersey Guard's joint staff.
""The Urban Augmentation Medical Task Force Soldiers come from all over the country,"" Smith said. ""Wisconsin, Florida, California and many others, coming together for the first time to work together supporting New Jersey.""
""The folks that make the most impact are the doctors and nurses and our active duty and reserve staff that are augmenting hospitals,"" said Coast Guard Cmdr. Shana Donaldson, a member of the U.S. Northern Command team. ""We've got Title 10 medical providers all over the state doing just amazing things.""
Even though they aren't on the front lines of the COVID-19 response, JOC service members recognize the key role they play.
""What our team does is very important and a big responsibility,"" Castria said. ""What we're doing here has a direct impact on what they're doing in the field. Being able to relay information correctly and accurately and quickly is critical to the mission.""

2020-05-06,"NJ GUARD, ACTIVE-DUTY TROOPS SET UP COVID-19 OPS CENTER",,"Everyone understands the urgency to control the COVID-19 pandemic. Recently, there have been arguments claiming hydroxychloroquine is the solution to control this pandemic, in the form of published opinion pieces and online videos. As a pharmacist, I study everything about drugs, write treatment guidelines, practice evidence-based medicine and serve as the last line of defense between drugs and patients. I strongly disagree with these claims. In fact, these claims are working against our efforts to defeat COVID-19.
When we evaluate data in clinical settings where patient care and health interventions are present, we need to examine the quality of the data. We look at whether studies were designed and done well, and we update ourselves with the most recent data. What we have been calling for is randomization and control. Randomization assures each individual has an equal probability to be in any group, and that groups are as balanced as possible. Control reduces the influence of factors outside of what we want to study.
On July 15, Oxford University reported in a randomized and controlled study that hydroxychloroquine did not reduce 28-day mortality after randomly allocating 1,561 patients to receive hydroxychloroquine and 3,155 patients to receive standard care. On July 23, TheNew England Journal of Medicine published a study of 667 patients, who were randomly given hydroxychloroquine, hydroxychloroquine and azithromycin or standard care, with a 1:1:1 ratio. This study found that the use of hydroxychloroquine, either alone or with azithromycin, did not improve outcomes. Cardiac side effects, however, were more frequent in individuals receiving hydroxychloroquine. Other well-designed studies published earlier have all shown that hydroxychloroquine has no benefit in managing COVID-19. Earlier observational studies have also pointed out the lack of benefits and safety profile when treating COVID-19 patients with hydroxychloroquine.
Considering the replicable evidence from multiple studies showing no benefits but safety concerns, it is not surprising to see health authorities all around the world, as well as the World Health Organization, halt hydroxychloroquine studies and recommend against its use.
However, articles mentioned by those who support hydroxychloroquine cannot go through the same level of robustness and quality check. Some frequently cited studies, include Gautret et al., have been criticized for flaws and poor research design. Ninety-five percent of the patients in the Million et al. study had a low degree of clinical illness, and authors had no control groups or attempts made for comparisons. Another widely mentioned one was a Google Document made by Zelenko; his original online work does not exist anymore, but a screenshot of what it looked like did not present solid evidence at all. Some also draw conclusions from a study done in Brazil, available only in Dropbox and on WordPress. This work not only had no formal research design, but did not even confirm whether enrolled patients actually had COVID-19. Many other studies used by hydroxychloroquine supporters should all be taken with multiple grains of salt because they are all poorly designed, inconclusive and outdated.
Back in March, when hydroxychloroquine first became a star, I wrote an op-ed to urge cautious prescribing and better quality data before affirmatively recommending any therapy. Four months later, I am reiterating the importance of evidence-based medicine and responsible health communication to the public, especially in the midst of a pandemic.
I do agree that this medication has been politicized. Politicians and political parties have taken advantage of uncertainty in this pandemic to gain political interests. This has been observed not only in the case of hydroxychloroquine, but in social distancing, masks and school reopening. We, as medical and public health professionals, promise to help the sick, do no harm, and rely on evidence. And that is exactly why we must stand against discordance and be meticulous about our comments to ensure the best quality of information and foster trust between the public and health authorities. We must stay united to serve the public and advise our decision-makers to walk the right path in a challenging time like this.
The keys to defeating COVID-19 are solidarity, leadership, transparency and collaboration. Hydroxychloroquine is not one of them, and wrongfully promoting this drug is not protecting our lives.

2020-07-30,Hydroxychloroquine Is Not a Key to Defeating COVID-19 | Opinion,,"Maybe it's wishful thinking to declare the pandemic over in the US, and presumptuous to conclude what lessons we've learned. So consider this a first draft.
1. Workers are always essential
We couldn't have survived without millions of warehouse, delivery, grocery and hospital workers literally risking their lives. Yet most of these workers are paid squat. Amazon touts its $15 minimum wage but it totals only about $30,000 a year. Many essential workers don't have health insurance or paid leave.
Lesson: Essential workers deserve far better.
2. Healthcare is a basic right
You know how you got your vaccine without paying a dime? That's how all healthcare could be. Yet too many Americans who contracted Covid-19 gotwalloped with humongous hospital bills.People with chronic disease,Black Americans and low-income children were most likely to have delayed or foregone care during the pandemic.Lesson: The U.S. must join the rest of the industrialized world and provide universal health coverage.
3. Conspiracy theories can be deadly
Last June, aboutone in four Americans believedthe pandemic was ""definitely"" or ""probably"" created intentionally. Other conspiracy theories have caused some people to avoid wearing masks or getting vaccinated,resulting in unnecessary illness or death.Lesson: An informed public is essential. Some of the responsibility falls on Facebook, Twitter and other platforms that allowed misinformation to flourish — and on the government for enabling them.
4. Wages are too low to get by on
Most Americans live paycheck to paycheck. So once the pandemic hit,many didn't have any savings to fall back on. Conservative lawmakers complain that the extra $300 a week unemployment benefit Congress enacted in March discourages people from working. What's really discouraging them is lack of childcare and lousy wages.Lesson: Raise the minimum wage, provide universal childcare, strengthen labor unions and push companies to share profits with their workers.
5. Remote work is now baked into the economy
The percentage of workers punching in from home hit ahigh of 70% in April 2020. A majority still work remotely. Some40% want to continue working from home.Two lessons: Companies will have to adjust. And much commercial real estate will remain vacant. Why not convert it into affordable housing?
6. It's past time for a wealth tax.
The combined wealth of America's 657 billionairesgrew by $1.3 trillion – or 44.6% – during the pandemic.Yet billionaires' taxes are lower than ever. Wealthy Americans todaypay one-sixth the rate of taxes their counterparts paid in 1953.Lesson: To afford everything the nation needs, raise taxes at the top.
7. Government can be the solution
Ronald Reagan's famous quip – ""Government is not the solution to our problem, government is the problem"" – can now officially be retired. Trump's ""Operation Warp Speed"" succeeded in readying vaccines faster than most experts thought possible. Biden got them into more arms more quickly than any vaccination program in history.
Furthermore, the $1.9 trillion Democrats pushed through in March will help the US achieve something it failed to achieve after the 2008-09 recession: a robust recovery. Lesson: The federal government did not just help beat the pandemic. It also did more to keep the nation afloat than in any previous recession. It must be prepared to do so again.

2021-06-10,Robert Reich: Seven Lessons We Need To Learn From COVID-19 - OpEd,,"Bangladesh, the shining model of development in South Asia, has become everyone's economic darling amidst Covid-19. The per capita income of Bangladesh in the fiscal year 2020-21 is higher than that of many neighbouring countries including India and Pakistan. Recently, Bangladesh has agreed to lend $200 million to debt-ridden Sri Lanka to bail out through currency swap. Bangladesh, once one of the most vulnerable economies, has now substantiated itself as the most successful economy of South Asia. How Bangladesh successfully managed Covid-19 and became top performing economy of South Asia?
In March 1971, Sheikh Mujibur Rahman declared their independence from richer and more powerful Pakistan. The country was born through war and famine. Shortly after the independence of Bangladesh, Henry Kissinger, then the U.S. national security advisor, derisively referred to the country as a ""Basket Case of Misery."" But after fifty years, recently, Bangladesh's Cabinet Secretary reported that per capita income has risen to $2,227. Pakistan's per capita income, meanwhile, is $1,543. In 1971, Pakistan was 70% richer than Bangladesh; today, Bangladesh is 45% richer than Pakistan. Pakistani economist Abid Hasan, former World Bank Adviser, stated that ""If Pakistan continues its dismal performance, it is in the realm of possibility that we could be seeking aid from Bangladesh in 2030,"". On the other hand, India, the economic superpower of South Asia, is also lagging behind Bangladesh in terms of per capita income worth of $1,947. This also elucidates that the economic decisions of Bangladesh are better than that of any other South Asian countries.
Bangladesh's economic growth leans-on three pillars: exports competitiveness, social progress and fiscal prudence. Between 2011 and 2019, Bangladesh's exports grew at 8.6% every year, compared to the world average of 0.4%. This godsend is substantially due to the country's hard-hearted focus on products, such as apparel, in which it possesses a comparative advantage.
The variegated investment plans pursued by the Bangladesh government contributes to the escalation of the country's per capita income. The government has attracted investments in education, health, connectivity and infrastructure both from home and abroad. As a long-term implication, investing in these sectors helped Bangladesh to facilitate space for businesses and created skilled manpower to run them swiftly. Meanwhile, the share of Bangladeshi women in the labor force has consistently grown, unlike in India and Pakistan, where it has decreased. And Bangladesh has maintained a public debt-to-GDP ratio between 30% and 40%. India and Pakistan will both emerge from the pandemic with public debt close to 90% of GDP.
Bangladesh's economy and industry management strategy during Covid-19 is also worth mentioning here since the country till now has successfully protected its economy from impact of pandemic. At the outset of pandemic, lockdowns and restrictions hampered the country's overall productivity for a while. To tackle the pandemic effect, Bangladesh introduced improvised monetary policy and fiscal stimuli to bring them under the safety net which lifted the situation from worsening. Government introduced stimulus package which is equivalent to 4.3 percent of total GDP and covers all necessary sectors such as industry, SMEs and agriculture.
These packages are not only a one-time deal, new packages are also being announced in course of time. For instance, in January 2021, government announced two new packages for small and medium entrepreneurs and grass roots populations. Apart from economic interventions, the government also chose the path of targeted interventions. The government, after first wave, abandoned widespread lockdown and adopted the policy of targeted intervention which is found to be effective as it allows socio-economic activities to carry on under certain protocols and helps the industries to fight back against the pandemic effect.
Another pivotal key to success was the management of migrant labor force and keeping the domestic production active amidst the pandemic. According to KNOMAD report, amidst the Covid-19, Bangladesh's remittance grew by 18.4 percent crossing 21 billion per annum inflow where many remittance dependent countries experienced negative growth rate. Because of the massive inflow of remittance, the Forex reserve of Bangladesh reached at 45.1 billion US dollar.
Bangladesh's success in managing COVID19 and its economy has been reflected in a recent report ""Bangladesh Development Update- Moving Forward: Connectivity and Logistics to strengthen Competitiveness,"" published by World Bank. Bangladesh's economy is showing nascent signs of recovery backed by a rebound in exports, strong remittance inflows, and the ongoing vaccination program. Through financial assistance to Sri Lanka and Covid relief aid to India, Bangladesh is showcasing its rise as an emerging superpower in South Asia.
That is why Mihir Sharma, Director of Centre for Economy and Growth Programme at the Observer Research Foundation, wrote in an article at Bloomberg that, ""Today, the country's 160 million-plus people, packed into a fertile delta that's more densely populated than the Vatican City, seem destined to be South Asia's standout success"". Back in 2017, PwC (PricewaterhouseCoopers) report also predicted the same that Bangladesh will become the largest economy by 2030 and an economic powerhouse in South Asia. And this is how Bangladesh, a development paragon, offers lessons for the other struggling countries of world after 50 years of its independence.

2021-02-18,"Uzbekistan , Hungary maintain growth in economic co-op despite COVID-19",,"The coronavirus brought with it not only a health crisis, but also a global economic shutdown. Social distancing forced restaurants to close, theaters to shut and businesses to adapt. One of the most affected industries continues to be tourism, as international travel is still far from resuming. This has a great impact not only on individuals, but on us as a collective – Israelis and world Jewry alike. Thankfully, this is also an example of how we can work together and help each other.
According to the United Nations' World Tourism Organization (UNWTO), international tourism dropped 97% in the months January through March 2020. In total, the crash in tourism during the first half of 2020 ""translates into a loss of 440 million international arrivals and about US$460 billion in export revenues from international tourism"" – more than five times the damage caused by the 2008-9 financial crisis. 
 For some 300,000 Israelis employed in the tourism sector, the closure of Israel's borders meant the loss of their income. Tour guides and bus drivers, as well as staff at hotels and attractions across the country, found themselves with no clients to serve. An industry responsible for over 2.5% of Israel's GDP – some $25 billion (USD) per year – was shut down.
At the same time, millions of Jews found their plans canceled. Passover trips and summer holidays were changed as international travel was no longer an option. For hundreds of thousands of Jews from the US, France, Britain and Argentina this meant calling off their plans to visit Israel. Semester-long high school programs, bar mitzvah celebrations, the iconic 10-day-long Taglit-Birthright experience and just simple family visits – everything was canceled.
World Jewry lost the option to travel to Israel, and Israelis lost the option of welcoming the Jewish visitors. For both sides, it is a serious loss – not only financially. The connection between Israel and the Jewish Diaspora is a central pillar of our national identity. Israel is, and must remain, a second home for all Jews; and Jews around the world know they are always welcome here. 
Two decisions by the Israeli government during the COVID-19 crisis highlight the unbreakable bond between the country and the Jewish people. In August, the cabinet approved the arrival of Jews in Israel for long-term programs, including the Jewish Agency's MASA and the study at yeshivas. Additionally, during the initial months of the outbreak, between February and May, hundreds of Jews, including COVID-19 victims, were brought to burial in Israel. These examples illustrate polar opposites of the centrality Israel plays in Jewish life – for those who want to come in their youth for a meaningful experience, and for those who decided it will be their eternal resting place.
Now, almost a year into the pandemic, vaccinations are available and there is a light at the end of the tunnel. Israel is inoculating its population at the fastest pace in the world, and other countries are stepping up their efforts. For the tourism industry, this is a true message of optimism, as vaccinations are key for the return of large-scale international travel.

As this happens, students will look to book vacations and families will begin to plan their trips. For Jews around the world, now is the time to make Israel their destination of choice. A spring vacation in Tel Aviv, a family holiday in Jerusalem or a honeymoon at the Dead Sea – Israel has something to offer everyone. After a forced hiatus from tourism in general, and for Jewish visitors in particular, Israel looks forward to hosting you once again.

2021-01-04,"Israel , the best post-COVID-19 tourist destination - opinion",,"More HIV-infected and unwanted pregnant women in Africa are feared by Evelyn Samba from the German Foundation for World Population. States invested too little in their healthcare. Fatal in the corona crisis:
With around 500,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases across the continent (as of July 11, 2020), Africa does not appear to have been hit as hard by the pandemic as other regions of the world. However, the numbers could be higher, as many governments on the continent lack the materials and resources to test for the virus.
Many African governments have put in place measures to shore up their economies and to cushion their citizens from a downturn in earnings. However, discussions about the effect of COVID-19 on other aspects of life, such as reproductive healthcare, and the well-being of women and girls at risk of gender-based violence, have been largely neglected.
This has already had dire effects on reproductive, maternal, new-born, child and adolescent health in Africa.
The disruption to access to sexual and reproductive health services in Africa is putting pregnant women and their families at increased risk. And this isn't just a short-term problem.
More unsafe births, less access to contraceptives and increased risk of contracting sexually transmitted disease also have long-term impacts on women, their families and societies.
In Zimbabwe, the number of caesarean sections performed decreased by 42%, and in April only 15% of births took place with skilled health attendants compared to last year. Access to contraceptives in many areas has decreased by 90%. In some parts of Kenya, only a quarter of pregnant women were able to go to antenatal clinics.
Access to public health services is vital
Millions of Africans depend on public health institutions for reproductive health. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in a report found that in times of crisis, reproductive health needs are likely to be overlooked. But even during the COVID-19 pandemic, African governments need to keep providing reproductive healthcare services.
That means, at the very minimum, the public health sector must be able to address complications of pregnancy and delivery, the transmission of sexually transmitted infections including HIV and AIDS, adolescent sexual and reproductive health concerns, and ensure access to condoms and other contraceptives.
Midwives need to be able to visit women and information campaigns need to continue even when everyone wears a facemask. And even during the pandemic, African women, and their partners, need to have a satisfying and safe sex life - and be able to choose if and when they want to have children.
If that is not ensured, countries across Africa are likely to see an increase in sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, increased unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions as well as a rise in maternal and neonatal deaths. Even before the pandemic, many
More focus on reproductive health needs
African governments were struggling with these issues. Many also did not manage to meet funding requirements for health - including sexual and reproductive healthcare.
Despite progress over the years, many African women and girls are still unable to enjoy their reproductive rights. Far too many women do not have access to modern contraceptives, too many adolescents and young people are getting pregnant and getting infected with HIV.
Maternal deaths are still unacceptably high. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 66% of the estimated global maternal deaths in 2017.
Improvements achieved over decades are now at stake if we do not pay attention to reproductive healthcare amid the pandemic.
The silver lining is that we have commitment from the highest political office on reproductive healthcare. At theNairobi Summiton the 25th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD +25) in 2019, African governments committed to provide much needed family planning information and services, to end preventable maternal deaths and maternal injuries, as well as stopping sexual and gender-based violence and harmful practices.
As African governments reorganize public health systems to respond to COVID-19, decision makers need to keep in mind that, at the same time, it is also imperative to provide adequate funding to meet the reproductive healthcare needs of African women and their partners.
Evelyn Samba is the Kenya country director of the German Foundation for World Population (DSW). The NGO works in several African countries and in Europe on sustainable and rights-based population development issues. One of its main focuses is ensuring access to sexual and reproductive health and rights services for women and young people.","PUBLIC HEALTH (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); PREGNANCY & CHILDBIRTH (91%); SEXUAL & REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH (91%); AIDS & HIV (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); FAMILY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS (90%); POPULATION SIZE (90%); SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE (90%); WOMEN'S HEALTH (90%); CONTRACEPTION (89%); EPIDEMICS (89%); OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (89%); WOMEN (89%); REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CLINICS (88%); BIRTHS & BIRTH RATES (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); GENDER BASED VIOLENCE (78%); GENDER EQUALITY (78%); INFANTS & TODDLERS (78%); MATERNAL & CHILD HEALTH (78%); MIDWIVES (78%); PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS (78%); SEX & GENDER ISSUES (78%); SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLE (78%); ADOLESCENTS & TEENS (77%); CHILDREN'S HEALTH (77%); HEALTH CARE ACCESS (77%); HEALTH CARE POLICY (77%); SEXUAL BEHAVIOR (77%); HEALTH CARE SECTOR PERFORMANCE (74%); ABORTION (73%); GENDER & SEX DISCRIMINATION (73%); NEGATIVE MISC NEWS (72%); UNITED NATIONS (68%); INFANT MORTALITY (67%); SURGERY & TRANSPLANTATION (66%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (62%); Coronavirus (%); Women and Gender (%)

Two Navy hospital ships deployed to New York and Los Angeles to aid in fighting the pandemic are winding down operations, Jonathan Rath Hoffman, assistant to the secretary of defense for public affairs, said.
The USNS Comfort left New York harbor for its home port in Norfolk today. The USNS Mercy in Los Angeles has stopped accepting new patients
""These are both welcome signs that the American public is following CDC guidelines and the number of COVID-19 cases are decreasing,"" Hoffman said. ""Local hospital capacity in these two areas have been sufficient to meet the demand.""
This does not mean that DOD personnel are out of the fight against coronavirus, though. In New York -- the hardest hit area in the country -- there are almost 700 uniformed doctors and nurses deployed in hospitals in the city and surrounding areas, Hoffman said.
But the DOD has worldwide missions, responsibilities and interests, and the Pentagon spokesman highlighted some of them.
He announced that British Royal Navy Commodore James Parkin turned over command of the International Maritime Security Construct in Manama, Bahrain to British Royal Navy Commodore Rob Bellfield in a virtual ceremony. The construct is meant to secure the vitally important Arabian Gulf region from malign actions. A total of eight nations participate in the construct and Parkin said he expects more to join.

2020-05-02,"DOD Spokesman Briefs on COVID-19 Ops, Bahrain Command, 5G Problems",,"The COVID-19 pandemic has taken its toll on every walk of life. The dynamics of society as well as business, have changed beyond recognition. While the resultant upheaval has meant catastrophe at the international level for most of the business, it has also produced an ideal environment for other businesses to thrive in. Products (like petroleum) are witnessing record negative prices, making the associated multinational companies suffer huge financial losses. On the contrary, the prices of gold are predicted to be doubled if the situation prevails.
Now that the social life across the globe has changed drastically, people are exploring new means of fighting boredom during the lockdown. This has had a tremendous impact on the entertainment industry. For instance, the cable operators are suffering losses as the number of subscribers has nosedived in recent months.
But, at the same time, digital streaming services like Netflix and Disney plus are making the most of the situation. Netflix's subscription has increased by 16 million in three months, making its total subscription of 183 million. In comparison to the initial three months' profit ($344 million) in 2019 the profit of the initial three months in 2020 is $709 million, which doubles the profit of the previous year making total revenue of $5.07 billion. Experts believe that the time till sports are banned the viewers will suspend their cable services and, therefore, the pandemic is making Netflix a popular streaming device.
A single documentary ""Tiger King"" is watched by more than 64 million households. Similarly, Disney Plus being one of the competitors of Netflix is also excelling at a faster pace and its subscribers have become doubled since February 2020 making the total number of subscribers to 50 million. Disney plus has taken 5 months to reach the number of its subscribers to that level while Netflix has taken 7 years to initially reach a subscriber number to 50 million.
Likewise, chain store businesses are suffering huge losses because of product expiry but e-commerce and online selling platforms are making huge sales and profit. As per the business experts, nowadays Amazon is selling products at a rate of $10000 per second. To meet the increasing demands of its customers, Amazon is planning to hire more than 75000 new staff, which will take the Amazon workforce to a million people while the other businesses and companies are laying off their employees. Amid the global pandemic, Amazon shares rise to 42%, reaching a value of $2400 per share and the net worth of amazon has reached nearly $1 trillion. The wealth of Jeff Bezos, the CEO of Amazon has grown by $24 billion, bringing his net worth to $143.1 billion, nearly $40 billion higher than the second-place Bill Gates, and is almost twice that of Warren Buffett.
Moreover, the travel industry is incurring huge losses during this pandemic. Airlines such as British & Jet Airways (British), Delta & South West Airways (US), Air China, and Korean Airways are facing huge financial losses daily due to the pandemic.
The vehicle industry is no exception as well, but on the contrary, the cycling manufacturing industry is enjoying this extreme situation and the cycles are selling like toilet papers in Australia. Due to the increasing use of bicycles the people in Australia have requested their government to extend the passages for cycles on the roads in the country. An extra shift has also been introduced for the employees related to the bicycle sales. Even on weekdays, there is a sale of the bicycle ranging from $10000 to $40000. This increase in the use and sale of bicycles is just because of the pandemic helping to fulfill the requirements for social distancing as well as keeping a balance in exercise during the lockdown.
The story doesn't end here. Many of the multinational companies are introducing a new product range in their existing businesses. LVMH, a French multinational corporation specializing in luxury goods has announced to convert three of its perfume manufacturing facilities where it normally makes fragrances for its Christian Dior, Givenchy, and Guerlain brands to make hand sanitizer instead.
Similarly, a newfound need for ventilators has made interesting partnerships among the medical device makers and car manufacturers. Ford, General Motors (GM), and Tesla are making ventilators to fight Covid-19. With such moves, these multinational companies are aiming to achieve several things. Responding to a shortage of hand sanitizer and ventilators on one hand while on the other hand, they are successfully positioning their selves to both of their consumers and employees as doing what's in the public interest. By reacting to these trends, the multinational companies are justifying the continuation of operations. All of those things are helping to make their image being more purposeful and less commercial.
Could anyone, in their wildest dreams, have predicted such a gigantic change in business trends? Well, its anybody's guess! For now, all we can say is that when nature dances, everything dances along.

2020-04-26,International Business And Unprecedented Trends During COVID-19 Pandemic – OpEd,,"Digitalization has in the past few years enabled developing countries in particular to leapfrog on financial inclusion. Countries like Kenya, Ghana, Rwanda and Tanzania have made great advances in connecting their citizens to financial systems by leveraging on mobile phone technology.
As the world has grappled with the COVID-19 pandemic, with closing of borders, curfews, lockdowns and other movement restrictions, digitalization has come to the rescue. Online shopping and entertainment, digital financial services, virtual meetings and events have taken center stage in lives and livelihoods globally.
Digital solutions
Policymakers at the onset of the pandemic took emergency measures to support and facilitate digital activities. The Central Bank of Kenya waived charges and expanded the limit for low-value mobile money transactions. This led to asignificantincrease in both value and number of transactions, mostly of $10 or less, helping to cushion the most vulnerable households, and attracting more than 1.6 million additional customers. In Rwanda, all charges were waived in March. By the end of April 2020, the weekly value of all kinds of mobile money transactions increased by450 percentfrom pre-pandemic levels.
Businesses also moved quickly to leverage the power of digital technology. In China,Ant Grouppartnered with more than 100 banks to launch theContactless Loansinitiative to help small and medium enterprises recover from COVID-19. In Brazil, the central bank is launchingPIX, an instant-payments system expected to become widely available this month. In India,Riskcovry, a Mumbai-based start-up, introduced a coronavirus insurance policy for businesses that want to offer their employees hospitalization and lost-wages coverage.
Fortuitously, for the last 18 months, as part of theUnited Nations Secretary-General's Task Force on Digital Financing of the Sustainable Development Goals, we explored how digitalization can help tackle the world's most urgent development challenges. COVID-19 only amplified its mandate. The pandemic has hindered the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals, particularly in health and education. Getting back on track will be imperative to achieve a global recovery.
How can digitalization help?
We have three recommendations to share. First, placing people at the center of the global financial system. Digitalization must be driven by the needs of the people and work for them. For instance, Kenya introduced in 2017 a mobile-based digital bond dubbed M‑Akiba to mobilize micro-savings of as little as $30 to finance government. Remarkably, 85 percent of investors were participating in the government securities market for the first time.
Second, connecting citizens to mitigate the digital divide. Over 700 million people lack broadband connectivity, while over a billion lack formal identification. Countries must invest in digital infrastructure and digital identity so their citizens can access online services. Coupled with that, there has to be investment in numeracy and financial literacy. International co-operation will be needed to support these efforts. The International Monetary Fund, World Bank and other international organizations are working with the private and public sectors globally to help countries.
Third, strengthen the governance of global digital financial platforms. The so-called Big Techs are transforming the delivery of services globally including in developing countries. COVID-19 has accelerated this trend as they get more entrenched in everybody's lives. However, developing countries have not been at the table when the governance of these platforms is discussed. One of the taskforce's key initiatives is the Dialogue on Global Digital Finance Governance, that seeks to facilitate a balanced and more inclusive dialogue, particularly involving developing nations, on better aligning Big Tech governance to the Sustainable Development Goals.
Down the road
As we build a digital bridge to the future, we must stay focused on the resultant risks. Cybersecurity, and data privacy and security are the greatest threats to vulnerable citizens using digital services for the first time. We must mitigate these risks and protect their information and their hard-earned money.
The pandemic crisis presents the greatest opportunity to enhance the lives and livelihoods of citizens. Governments, the private sector, international organizations and citizens must take up the challenge of increasing digitalization and dare to make a difference. The moment is now!

ISTANBUL
Putin has maneuvered himself and the Russian government into a position of 'Zugzwang' -- a chess term denoting a situation in which one's king has to move, but cannot, because any move would result in a check.
Back in January, Russian President Vladimir Putin announced his support for a constitutional change that would 'reset' the clock on his previous terms in the office, giving him the right to once again run for the presidency and stay there until 2036. By then, he will be 84 years old and -- if he makes it -- the longest-ruling leader in Russian history.
These proposed amendments gained international attention, bringing extreme political upheaval, both domestically and internationally. However, Putin's carefully crafted plan could not come at a worse time for Russia. The vote was initially set for April 22, and no new date has been announced.
Now it seems that a microscopic virus could be detrimental for the political myths, cultivated by Putin, of being the country's protector as problems are piling up for the man who has dominated Russia since 2000. Anything that messes with that image, whether it is large-scale virtual protests or economic instability, ruins the myth he and his allies have been reproducing for decades.
The Kremlin has a clear domestic target to consolidate society through a systematic appeal to traditional conservative values. Therefore, the proposed changes would re-write Russia's identity as a conservative nation that will be built on core values such as traditional families, respect for the elderly, patriotism, and religion. For the first time since the fall of the Russian Empire in 1917, the country's constitution may include a reference to religion and God. For years he has cultivated a particular conservative image for the Russian public, a man of 'action' and a patriotic guardian of the country's history and values. However, the ever-increasing outbreak bounced in Russia reporting more than 10,000 new COVID-19 cases for the sixth day in a row, and now it presents an unexpected test for the institutions and the system that Putin has built.
As the number of confirmed cases of the virus is accelerating rapidly in Russia, COVID-19 puts overwhelming pressure on its finances from an oil price war due to the OPEC+ agreement on production cuts. These recent dynamics could shake the country's economy as the government is trying to shift from the political considerations of amending the Constitution to curbing the rapid spread of the virus across Russia. Russia is still a petro-driven economy, and the combination of lower oil prices and lower oil production as a result of the OPEC+ deal is likely to increase Russia's weaknesses in the structure of oil markets.
Lower oil prices are bad news for the Russian economy, hitting not only the Russian government's day-to-day budget but also the country's funds, which were built up over years of stable oil prices. The combination of the pandemic and the fall in oil prices has hit the Russian economy hard. Moscow and St. Petersburg are now under citywide quarantines. The Kremlin is also pushing regional governors to adopt stricter measures, as the pandemic has been spreading across the Russian territory.
Russian officials have urged its citizens to stay home, while, however, giving companies little tangible support. Therefore, anger is growing at what many say is a lack of adequate support from the state to ordinary people and small and medium-sized businesses. The people's resentment was expressed online using the 'conversations' tool on the mobile apps Yandex.maps and Yandex.navigator. Some consider these digital protests as a threat to Putin's post-Corona regime.
The first protest occurred in the city Rostov-on-don when the Rostov Mayor's Office introduced changes to the procedure for obtaining travel permits. Employers are required to purchase travel passes on behalf of their employees. However, there are only nine points of distribution for these passes and employers are supposed to call ahead. Residents complained that they were unable to get through the digital platform. Subsequently, long lines formed at the issuance points on April 20, and other virtual rallies popped up in other cities across Russia. The organizers invited supporters to send them ""virtual"" placards that will be shown live during the protest. Locals also dropped pins near the government buildings and wrote messages of complaint about the difficulties of self-isolation orders, ranging from lost jobs to ineligibility for social assistance. Users mostly complained about the financial challenges and the loss of jobs they are facing due to self-isolation. Tens of millions of Russian citizens have lost all or part of their incomes, sit in isolation, and receive no financial support from the federal center.
Stability has become ruined, and Putin's role has come under scrutiny. Trust in Russian state media is low, as a recent poll from the Levada Centre, an independent polling organization, found that 59 percent of Russians do not fully believe the official figures on COVID-19. Putin twisted himself into policy as well as rhetorical knots through his insistence to stay in power. Next year, the regime will be in the survival mode, and managing public opinion appears to be a top concern. In any case, with tens of millions of Russians struggling financially, there is no enthusiasm right now for Putin's constitutional amendments.

2020-05-11,OPINION - Could COVID-19 spoil Putin's constitutional amendments?,,"The following information was released by McGill University:
But many experts surveyed also believe vaccine development will take place at an accelerated rate
Experts working in the field of vaccine development tend to believe that an effective vaccine is not likely to be available for the general public before the fall of 2021. In a paper published recently in the Journal of General Internal Medicine, a McGill-led team published the results of a recent survey of 28 experts working in vaccinology.
The survey was carried out in late June 2020. The majority of those surveyed were mostly Canadian or American academics with an average of 25 years of experience working in the field.
""Experts in our survey offered forecasts on vaccine development that were generally less optimistic than the timeline of early 2021 offered by US public officials. In general they seem to believe that a publicly available vaccine next summer is the best-case scenario with the possibility that it may take until 2022,"" said Jonathan Kimmelman, a James McGill professor and the director of the Biomedical Ethics Unit at McGill University and the senior author on the paper.
Many experts also believe that there may be some false starts before an effective vaccine is available. ""The experts we surveyed believe that there is a 1 in 3 chance that the vaccine will receive a safety warning label after approval, and a 4 in 10 chance that the first large field study will not report efficacy,"" added Patrick Kane, the lead author, who is a decision scientist and postdoctoral fellow at McGill.
Predicting timelines for vaccine development
Experts were asked to make timeline forecasts for three milestones in vaccine development. More specifically, experts were asked for their best, soonest, and latest estimates for when each of the following milestone would occur:
Question - When will a vaccine be available to the general public in the USA and/or Canada?
Answers
best guess = September/October 2021 (average)
soonest = June 2021 (average)
latest = July 2022 (average)
Question - When will a field study with at least 5000 participants report results?
Answers
best guess = March 2021 (average)
soonest = December 2020 (average)
latest = July 2021 (average)
Question - when will a vaccine be available to those at highest risk from the virus in the USA and/or Canada?
Answers
best guess = March/April 2021 (average)
soonest = February 2021 (average)
latest = December 2021 (average)
The researchers believe that this kind of approach, where people are asked to suggest a range of responses provides a more complete picture of the range of expert belief than media quotes from individuals.
Likelihood of setbacks
The study also showed that about 1/3 of those surveyed believe that vaccine development is likely to face may face the following setbacks:
that the first vaccine widely deployed in the USA and/or Canada will receive a boxed warning from the FDA to highlight serious or life-threatening adverse reactions; or
that the first large field trial in the USA and/or Canada will report a null or negative result in terms of efficacy.
""Our study finds that experts are largely in agreement about the timeline for a SARS-CoV-2 vaccine,"" says Stephen Broomell, an associate professor at the Dietrich College of Humanities and Social Sciences, at Carnegie Mellon University. ""While this does not track with many overly optimistic government projections, it reflects a belief that researchers are indeed on a faster pace to development compared to previous vaccines.""

2020-10-01,EXPERT OPINION: COVID-19 VACCINE ROLLOUT UNLIKELY BEFORE FALL 2021,,"Doctors across the world are using TikTok to spread information about the coronavirus, including COVID-19 vaccines. Is the decision to use this Chinese social media platform for such purpose a right approach? I think not, and I think European doctors should refrain themselves from doing so.
In September 2020, Rich Waterworth, TikTok's General Manager for Europe, announced on TikTok's official website that the platform now had100 million usersin Europe. These users constitute around 13.4 percent of the total population of Europe, which is approximately 741.9 million. This number of users in Europe could perhaps lead the European doctors to start using the platform for coronavius and other issues in the hope of reaching a large portion of the Europe's population, especially the younger generation, via this platform.
If considered from the angle of marketing strategy, the use of TikTok for spreading any helpful information would appear to be the right decision. However, when it comes to the larger issues like cyber-security, privacy and regional security perspectives, I fear such strategy is bad for the whole world, including Europe and the Europeans.
There are allegations that the private data of millions of TikTok users are being channeled directly to China. A task-force has already been established by the European Data Protection Board to review the platform's personal data processing principles and procedures.
The data collected by TikTokincludesbiometric data (including face of the users), hardware data (CPU type, hardware ID, disk space, memory usage, etc.), data on other apps users have installed (including deleted ones), network-related information (device and router IP and MAC addresses, WiFi access point), whether or not the device is rooted, and regular GPS pings.
Almost all of the aforementioned data can be used to understand the mindset of an individual user or of users from a particular age group in any given location. This information or data can be used in some point of time in future to manipulate those users and to influence their perceptions, judgments, etc.
The fact that TikTok actively targets young users is more dangerous than it seems. TikTok has given China the means to show any content directly onto the phones of millions of young Europeans. ""What seems as good fun at 13 can become apile of datathat will remain relevant and usable when they're 40."" Hence, China would be able to manipulate in future the European businessmen, entrepreneurs and overall workforce via this platform.
Hence, considering the above concerns about TikTok, it may well be concluded that if the European doctors use TikTok to spread important information, includng about the coronavirus, they will be tacitly giving some kind of endorsement to this social media platform that, I fear, would become a risk factor for security of the European countries in future.
Taking the aforesaid factors into account, policy makers in European countries and regional bodies like the European Union should take appropriate — even harsh if necessary — step regarding TikTok in order to save Europe from the potential overwhelming Chinese influence in future.

2021-02-16,Doctor's Shouldn't Use TikTok To Spread Important COVID-19 Information – OpEd,,"BRISBANE, Queensland, Aug. 8 -- Queensland Health issued the following media release:
Opinion piece - Please attribute the below to Dr Jeannette Young, Chief Health Officer:
Let's start with two indisputable facts.
The Delta variant is a heinous virus that has disrupted our lives and even threatened the health of our kids.
And Queenslanders are an extraordinary bunch of people who have a knack for overcoming tough times.
Neither of these points are secret but they became glaringly obvious in the past week following the emergence of the ""Indooroopilly"" cluster.
Thanks to your caring, selfless spirit, we have managed to somewhat fend off what could have been a crisis. Somehow, we have been able to ease some restrictions just over a week after recording the first local case of the cluster.
That's not to say we have not suffered during lockdown or that we are even in the clear - we still have more than 100 cases associated with the cluster.
Make no mistake - this cluster still concerns me.
But the outcomes in the past week indicate the cluster is on its way to being contained.
To have daily cases in the single digits is a remarkable feat given the grip this disease can have on communities.
Look at other countries. Even other states.
It's because of you. Your willingness to stay home, to wear a mask, to sacrifice simple pleasures like a coffee with friends, a dinner out with family, a trip to the shops.
And I'm aware this lockdown hurt many people financially. I am truly sympathetic to those people and those businesses and I wish there were other ways to protect people during an outbreak.
Our Cairns family, friends and colleagues will begin a similar situation today, and we hope its only for a few days.
However, there is no safe and effective way to protect the Queensland population, at least until we reach herd immunity with vaccinations.
In all likelihood, we will endure more lockdowns before that happens.
If the original COVID-19 was a formidable foe, then the Delta variant is a stronger, super strain that requires every ounce of effort to fight.
As we've seen, it has attacked our children and our youths, affecting them far more than other variants.
While young people are less likely to fall severely ill if they are infected, they are now believed to be able to transmit the virus to other people.
This wasn't the case with earlier strains. That's what we are concerned about.
More than 65 of the cluster's cases are 19 or under. Five schools were impacted.
So far, more than 15,000 people are contacts, and more than 10,000 were quarantined.
Had it not been for a quickly imposed lockdown and the will of Queenslanders to abide by the rules, these numbers could've spread like wildfire.
We could be reporting a death toll alongside daily case numbers.
We can't claim to have beaten Delta.
The best we can say is we are weathering a Delta storm, and probably not the last one.
But I know Queensland will be ready.

Cough Remedies Market
Rise in incidences of respiratory disorders such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disorder (COPD), asthma, pneumonia, and other severe respiratory infections.
PORTLAND, OREGON, UNITED STATES, September 8, 2022 /EINPresswire.com / -- According to a new report published by Allied Market Research, titled,""cough remedies market by type, application and end users: opportunity analysis and industry forecast, 2021-2030,' the global cough remedies market size was valued at $ 7084.5 million in 2020, and is projected to reach $ 9911.2 million by 2030, registering a CAGR of 3.4% from 2021 to 2030.
Cough is induced due to response when respiratory system is attacked by certain antigens entering the body, which include dust, bacteria, virus, or other substances that cause irritation in the respiratory tract. This creates an immune response and causes difficulty in breathing; the alveoli get clogged with fluid or leads to formation of pus. According to the severity of cough, medications are to be given. For instance, if an individual is suffering from dry cough, expectorants are suggested. Major causes of cough include bacteria, fungi, viruses, and other bacteria-like organisms. Cough remedies include medications such as antihistamines that can help in management of inflammation. Cough can be life-threatening and can be particularly lethal for infants, children, and individuals over 65. Most common signs that help diagnose cause of cough include analysis of color of mucus secreted, which varies from yellow or even bloody mucus to greenish mucus.

2022-09-08,What Are The Expert's Opinion After Covid 19 On Cough Remedies Market?,,"Jul 24, 2020( City Limits: http://www.citylimits.org Delivered by Newstex) ; Nadavspi~commonswiki/CityLimitsAs an urban planner and a lover of cities, I am desperate to be rosy about the future of my beloved city. But as an economist and strategist, I have to go where the facts lead. And for our cities—and specifically our central business districts—the news right now is potentially devastating.When people say 'cities come back, they always do,' or 'pandemics have happened before and look, our cities remained,' they ignore a fundamental truth that distinguishes this moment from many others. CityViews[1] are readers' opinions, not those of City Limits. 
Add your voice today![2] But before we get there, let's start with the fact that cities thrive when endowed with access to resources, markets and human capital. New York City, with its preeminent information-based economy, offers businesses an unmatched agglomeration of talent and knowledge. This is why, even despite our high cost of living and wages, Amazon chose New York (before pulling out) for one of two headquarters over other competitors.So, while many urban theorists are doubling down on the future of cities, I just can't get there—not yet at least. What many miss in their arguments that 'density does not correlate with the virus' (which is true) is that we cannot cherry pick the lessons of history. Cities don't always grow, and contraction and population loss is in fact a real threat that we must grapple with.Others postulate that the pandemic is an opportunity to right-size the city with lower rents and lower housing costs. Also true, but this argument simultaneously misses the point that downsizing will send the city's budget into a nosedive and reduce our ability to invest and maintain high-quality services. Dramatic changes in the size of cities and their growth trajectories do in fact happen. When they do it is often attributed to major historical events, one of which, I'm afraid, we are smack dab in the middle of.Transportation technology, in particular, is a historic agent of change for many cities. Take the growth and later economic demise of Western New York, which can be attributed to the Erie Canal, later eclipsed by the railroads (a textbook case of creative destruction if there ever was one). Or the transformation of Denver and Atlanta into major cities as a result of access offered by international airports. New technology and transportation innovation, when taken together, are the one-two punch that create major disruption in urban growth patterns. And New York, whether we like it or not, is in a moment where we face the confluence of irresistible forces whose impact is still unknown.By 'forces' I mean the rapid and immediate growth in remote work, required by the pandemic but aided and abetted by video conferencing technology that has rendered a commute to the office or even a business trip, well, unnecessary. Simply put, technological advancements mean that knowledge travels, but people don't have to. This singular technological shift has the potential to disrupt the system upon which New York's economic growth rests.You may say that this technology has existed for years, so what's the difference now? Businesses that would otherwise never have considered abandoning central business district office space have prevailed through a forced test case. Moreover, many firms have unexpectedly warmed to remote knowledge-sharing tools and found them to be, if not a perfect substitute for in-person working, a darn good one. From blue-chip firms like Morgan Stanley to new-economy businesses like Twitter, many CEOs are now reconsidering their need for premium office space, a decision that has a tremendous financial upside by shifting occupancy costs off of their ledgers and onto that of their employees. A powerful motivator, for certain.The future remains unwritten. It is too soon to tell whether telework will remain a viable option for the white-collar employees who make up the bulk of daytime employees in our central business districts, even if it is not an option for essential workers and those in production, manufacturing and distribution.Despite all of this, it is critically important to recognize that New York retains a competitive advantage, which is why I remain bullish on our future. Our city's sheer size and scale reflects over 300 years of accumulated investments in infrastructure and institutions that are frankly impossible to replicate anywhere else.The pandemic has not diminished our human nature and desire to experience culture, learn, and explore. One look at the risks that people are taking to go parties or local bars dispels the myth that human nature has changed in any substantive way. We still crave human connections. And the great museums and cultural institutions that fuel our visitor economy - even if their current operational existence is at risk - will find an audience after this is over. Broadway, too, will come back, fueling the restaurant industry in and around Times Square, which feeds millions of annual visitors.Our subway and regional commuter infrastructure is yet another competitive advantage. When we are no longer scared of proximity, or as people become more comfortable with the new normal of mask-wearing, these assets will continue to support our resiliency as a city. This means we must continue investments in vital infrastructure - including the infrastructure to support new micro-mobility transportation options - which will hold us in good stead as we recover from the pandemic.Urban policy makers should not despair. This is the time to make bold moves as well as investments that will ensure that New York remains a destination of choice. These decisions will ensure we attract and retain the next generation of young, ambitious and bright people who want to start their careers and build their lives in this great city — not to mention those of all incomes for whom New York is already home. Investments in neighborhoods and quality of life for all (not to mention great broadband service!) as well as housing affordability, will be necessary to ensure that New York retains its competitive advantage.While I'm concerned, I do believe that policies and investments matter in determining our outcomes. But we don't save this city by burying our heads in the sand. We save it by understanding the existential threats we are facing and coming together to face these challenges head on - as New Yorkers do so well.Larisa Ortiz is an MIT-trained urban planner, a Managing Director of Research + Analysis at Streetsense and a New York City Planning Commissioner.

2020-07-24,"Opinion: After COVID-19, NYC's Future Depends on Bold Moves",,"Most of the headlines about COVID-19's global upheaval focus on how adversaries like China have begun acting more belligerently against U.S. interests. But increasingly, Turkey, formally a NATO ally, is also taking advantage of the pandemic to expand its influence in very destabilizing ways across the Eastern Mediterranean, an area of growing importance to the United States.
Washington's own lack of focus on the region helped invite Ankara's aggressiveness, which in turn is increasing tensions at the heart of the transatlantic alliance, undermining America's ability to promote peaceful energy development and worsening the civil war in Libya.
A new report released today from the Eastern Mediterranean Policy Project at the Jewish Institute for National Security of America (JINSA), which we co-chair, illustrates the troubling effects of Turkey's actions amid COVID-19 and how things could go from bad to worse with further U.S. inaction.
Certainly, Turkey was becoming steadily more assertive in the years prior to the pandemic. President Recep Tayyip Erdoğan's embrace of an interventionist, Islamic-tinged nationalism led to confrontations with almost every other country in the Eastern Mediterranean—in particular, over Libya and exploring the region's potentially massive undersea natural gas deposits. Driven largely in reaction to Turkish policy, even before coronavirus many U.S. partners in the Middle East and southern Europe—including NATO allies France and Greece—began developing closer defense and energy ties among themselves.
And while COVID-19 thus far has impacted the region less than other global hotspots, its economic effects are hitting the energy sector especially hard. This is delaying further exploration by American and other Western companies, as well as damaging prospects for a major U.S.-backed pipeline project to send gas from Cyprus and Israel to Europe. Turkey's economy, which only began emerging from recession last year, appears especially stressed by the pandemic.
Yet rather than mend ties with neighbors and important trade partners, Erdoğan turned to his fellow Muslim Brotherhood-supporting ally Qatar for financial relief. He also doubled down on his recent aggressions in potentially energy-rich waters around Cyprus and Greece, and on the ground in Libya. In June, Paris accused a Turkish warship of essentially training its guns on a French frigate enforcing the Libya arms embargo. Then in July, Turkey announced, but has yet to fulfill, plans to explore for energy around Greek islands.
Looking ahead, the pandemic likely will lead to heightened instability and tensions in the Eastern Mediterranean, driven primarily by further provocations from Turkey. Like Beijing, Ankara may view the situation in Europe and America as an indication that they will be preoccupied internally and may not have the wherewithal to counter Turkish moves in the Eastern Mediterranean. To date, certainly, Turkey's actions have not encountered significant pushback from Europe or the United States, other than minimal E.U. sanctions.
Erdoğan also may conclude that postponed exploration by Western energy companies will continue diminishing America's interest in regional events. This could provide Turkey a unique window to move unilaterally and create a fait accompli that companies, or even countries, might be unwilling or unable to contest. Should the Turkish economy deteriorate further, escalation with Greece, Cyprus, France or others might well become increasingly attractive to distract the public from problems at home.
Despite its own COVID-related challenges, the United States cannot simply continue ignoring the pandemic's effects on Turkey's actions in the Eastern Mediterranean. To be sure, the lack of concerted or coherent U.S. policy toward the region, in particular Libya, is a years-old bipartisan failure spanning administrations from both parties, but the consequences are only becoming more important as COVID-19 encourages instability at the hands of Turkey.
Most recently, the Trump administration sided with France in its recent naval dispute with Turkey off the coast of Libya, where the two NATO allies back opposing sides in the civil war. Yet it also continues supporting the Turkish-backed government in Tripoli, and it criticizes the EU's arms embargo on Libya for singling out Turkey. Meanwhile, the larger absence of U.S. leadership helps Libya sink deeper into a major proxy conflict that increasingly involves almost everyone in the region.
The increasingly high stakes and uncertainty surrounding the future of the Eastern Mediterranean means the United States needs to seriously convey its commitment to regional stability. Washington should appoint a special envoy for the Eastern Mediterranean to promote the collaborative exploitation of regional energy resources and create a clear counterweight to Turkey's efforts to disrupt peaceful energy development. An envoy would also try to devise a negotiated solution to the Libya conflict and seek to address the growing humanitarian consequences of COVID-19 in the region.
For the first time since the Cold War, American policymakers must make abundantly clear to friends and foes alike that the Eastern Mediterranean is a critical focus for U.S. national security strategy.

2020-07-29,Washington Must Address Turkey's Rising Aggression Amid COVID-19 | Opinion,,"Sri Lanka's migrant workers are an integral part of our economy, with their remittances traditionally accounting for the second largest share of the country's foreign exchange earnings (8% of GDP in 2019) after merchandise exports. After the COVID-19 outbreak and resultant difficulties, a sizeable proportion of migrants looked forward to a safe return home. This blog, written to mark International Migrants Day, examines the experience and challenges in the repatriation process and offers suggestions on the way forward.
The Repatriation Challenge
Sri Lanka has found the process of repatriating vast numbers of Sri Lankans abroad since the closure of international airports for inward travel hugely challenging. The government coordinated large-scale repatriation missions to bring home different categories of migrants - such as students, pilgrims and workers - including those undocumented. By mid-October 2020, after bringing home over 54,000 citizens, at least another 43,000 migrants remain to be repatriated. Compared to the total of 4,992 and 1,179 repatriations handled in 2017 and 2018 respectively, the current scale of repatriations is challenging the capacity of the relevant authorities.
High Air Travel Costs 
The first COVID-19-induced repatriation was the return of 33 Sri Lankan students from Wuhan, China in February 2020. This initial repatriation was at state expense. Similarly, the repatriation of beneficiaries under the Kuwait Amnesty was facilitated by the Kuwaiti and Sri Lankan governments. Most other repatriation missions involved a payment by the returnee. The cost of paid air travel under repatriation is criticised as too high. For instance, the (one-way) air-ticket cost in a repatriation flight from India in April 2020 was LKR 58,650 as opposed to a normal air travel cost of approximately LKR 25,074. The cost of an air-ticket from Chicago in June 2020 was approximately LKR 520,430, and from Dubai in July 2020 was approximately LKR 81,000. A repatriation flight from Kuwait in August showed that infants also had to pay the full adult fare. For many Sri Lankan migrants seeking repatriation, such fees are unaffordable.
Nevertheless, such high fees are defended based on cost factors including having to charter flights, fly empty flights on the way to pick Sri Lankans, airports not being fully operational, and the absence of service contracts leading to higher fees for landing, parking, and ground handling, etc. Moreover, the special COVID-19 airline operational procedures and operating below capacity contribute to higher per passenger cost.
Identifying Migrants for Repatriation
With the prolonged closure of entry points, the number of Sri Lankans wanting repatriation kept rising. Despite high demand, the timing of repatriation had to be a function of capacity to provide medical and quarantine facilities, due to the trade off in allocating spots between those already here and returnees. As such, repatriation efforts were stalled on many instances, such as in end-May due to the high rate of infection among returnees under the Kuwait Amnesty, in July due to the expansion of the Kandakadu drug rehabilitation centre cluster, and in October due to the emergence of Minuwangoda and Peliyagoda clusters.
Similarly, the government adopted a ""rotational selection of destinations for repatriation - with high risk as well as low risk destinations interspersed"" to minimise the threat of infections among repatriated. Within countries identified for repatriation, migrants were selected based on need and vulnerability such as undocumented workers, newly unemployed, and those deprived of salaries.
Role of the Private Sector
The combination of capacity constraints, excess demand and willingness to pay gradually has created a market for repatriation. The result was a fee-based repatriation package for travel and quarantine. While state-sponsored quarantine facilities were available, the paid option for quarantine was a minimum of LKR 7500 per day for the 14 days in a hotel including hotel transfer and two PCR tests. Both types of quarantine services are under government supervision, while the latter provides more amenities.
In August 2020, the paid full package repatriation from Kuwait in twin-shared occupancy was approximately LKR 250,000, while the cost from Saudi Arabia was LKR 220,000. However, the cheaper (sharing) option among paid quarantine involves the risk of extra 14 days of paid quarantine, should the other shared guest test positive for COVID-19. As such, the popular choices were single occupancy paid quarantine and state-sponsored free quarantine. Along with hotels offering paid quarantine facilities, private entities became involved in coordinating repatriation.
Similarly, proposals were submitted for the full package of travel and quarantine, i.e. transportation and two weeks quarantine aboard a ship. Now, amidst lobbying by medical stakeholders for private sector medical care for COVID-19 patients, the future repatriation packages are likely to include the choice of paid or state sponsored treatment should the migrant test positive for COVID-19.
Confusion and Corruption
With paid repatriation services, related scams emerged where prioritised services were offered for a premium price or to facilitate entry permission to Sri Lanka. Similarly, there has been confusion about repatriation information. For example, as revealed during interviews for this blog, one returnee from Dubai in July had misunderstood the per day fee and as the total fee and was unable to pay for quarantine facilities received in a hotel in Galle. Moreover, a group of migrants who were repatriated on December 3, 2020 had started the journey by stating their intention to undergo paid quarantine, but upon arriving insisted on state-sponsored quarantine. Amidst allegations of corruption, (E.g. embassy officials in UAE are alleged to have received between LKR 50,500-100,000 to ensure a seat on immediate flights), if this change of heart of returnees upon arrival was not a genuine confusion, it raises the question if opting for paid quarantine is an express channel for repatriation?
Way Forward
The stepping in of the private sector is timely to ease the government's burden, and saves capacity in state-sponsored quarantine facilities. Similarly, the anticipated reopening of Sri Lankan borders for inward travel would reduce the stock of Sri Lankan migrants on the repatriation list, and would make room for those unable to afford paid return. In the interim, a more inclusive, affordable and transparent approach is needed to minimise the financial and emotional cost to Sri Lankan migrants awaiting repatriation. Some strategies are:
* Make cost structure for repatriation airfares transparent
* Explore ways to reduce airfare costs
* Make the repatriation selection process transparent
* Maintain two separate lists for those who can and cannot afford repatriation and quarantine, and ensure migrants from both lists are considered for repatriation.

2020-12-16,Opinion: COVID-19 and Migrant Workers: The Economics of Repatriation,,"May 08, 2021( The People's Vanguard of Davis: http://davisvanguard.org Delivered by Newstex)  <nl/ > (ALTAF QADRI, AP) <nl/ > By Jacob Derin <nl/ > The Indian COVID-19 crisis is reaching a critical point, one the United States was forced to contend with a few months ago. The strain on the Indian healthcare system is beginning to take its toll[1]. As the United States, Israel[2]and other countries continue to push forward with their vaccination campaigns, some parts of the world have been badly left behind. <nl/ > The Biden Administration recently shipped supplies[3] to India to help alleviate the crisis. 
Will it be enough? Only time will tell, but if current trends are any indication, the answer is a resounding 'no.' <nl/ > As reported cases skyrocket across the country, the official numbers are almost certainly an undercount in a country of nearly 1.4 billion. This is a good time for countries with (relatively) successful vaccination campaigns to ask, 'are we doing enough?' <nl/ > Aside from the plain humanitarian reasons for supporting India, there are rational reasons to do so out of pure self-interest. Any reservoir of COVID-19 is a place where new variants can emerge. And we don't really know[4] how long immunity from the vaccines lasts. A large population of infected people could easily start the pandemic all over again when protection from the vaccines wears off. <nl/ > We can and should make plans for booster shots of the COVID-19 vaccine; however, if the disastrous vaccine rollout last time around is any indication of the future, I wouldn't stake my life on it. Incidentally, that's precisely what I would be doing. <nl/ > The humanitarian aid the U.S. and other countries have shipped to India thus far is a good start. However, it won't be nearly enough to stem the tide of death and horror resulting from the Indian healthcare system buckling altogether. It is currently showing some signs[5] of doing so. <nl/ > Just months ago, the United States recorded thousands of COVID-19 deaths a day, and it could be justifiably ranked among the hardest-hit countries. Now that the vaccination campaign has begun to turn the tide, the consequentialist calculus has shifted dramatically. Dollar for dollar and shot for shot, COVID-fighting resources will spare more death and suffering in India than they will almost anywhere else at the moment. <nl/ > I don't mean to suggest that governments abandon their respective duties to their own citizens to give this aid, but they can and should be doing more than they are. One simple yet surprisingly difficult step we could take would be to release the patent[6] on Pfizer and Moderna's mRNA vaccines. <nl/ > The purpose of the patent system, to incentivize and reward innovation, has been served. Now the moral calculus weighing intellectual property on the one hand and potentially hundreds of thousands of deaths on the other seems pretty straightforward. At least it is to me. But maybe my math skills have slipped during the lockdowns. <nl/ > The pandemic is reaching a delicate point at which the disparities in its effects will be genuinely stark. Wealthy, technologically sophisticated counties will be able to control and contain it (at least for now), while less fortunate societies will be wracked with misery.

2021-05-08,Student Opinion: The COVID-19 Crisis In India Is A Moral Crisis For Us,,"By Jan Oberg*
Defender Europe 20is a huge, basically US military exercise, on European soil between February and May this year. It has already started. In the midst of a closed-down coronavirus Europe. And it is war-preparing, not peace- or confidence-building.
The diagram above from the British Army offers you details of this perverse, surreal idea – take note of Italy being one of the planned participants!
Most likely, you have not heard about Defender Europe 20. When it comes to US foreign and war policies, all Western mainstream media practice self-censorship. The media would hardly be able to write about this exercise of militarist madness in a way that would not cause an uproar and moral condemnation in these times of deep, widespread concerns aboutwar risks, climate change and the coronavirus.
So better not write at all and cause diplomatic troubles with the unpredictable, choleric Master in Washington.
The submissiveness of the EU to the US is well-documented by the tacit act of accepting that theunspeakably cruel US sanctions on Iranshall also be implemented by NATO/EU allies in Europe and by the fact that the EU has no alternative, unified policy vis-a-vis Russia and China – including the latter'sBelt And Road Initiative, the world's largest and by far most visionary civilian cooperation project).
There are at least three arguments why this is – simply put –indecent and irresponsible:
It is clearly provocative and tension-increasing (by its size, target and overall purpose) and can onlyadd to the Cold War atmospherebetween Russia and US/NATO.It is irresponsible in the extreme to hold such an exercise with tons of heavy military materiel and movement of thousands of soldiers over the Atlantic and around Europe in these times when every informed citizen anywhere is deeply concerned aboutthe global climate situation.
WritesJudith Deutschina recent article on The Transnational: ""The military is the single largest institutional emitter of greenhouse gases, but its emissions are exempt under the Kyoto Protocol, a convenient accomplishment negotiated by Nobel Peace Prize recipient Al Gore. In its practice of protecting property and oil installations, in its mandate to kill, and in securitizing borders, the military is also the single largest contributor to climate injustice.""
As of writing, there is no announcement that EuroDefender20 will becancelled– only scaled down – because of COVID-19, the coronavirus.
The risks taken here in the name of providing ""security"" – one of the most grave and consistent lies of our time – is as unethical as it is irresponsible.
It is a provocation of the world's citizens in a pandemic situation of much fear and huge risks of overall breakdown as well as deep economic crisis for months and years ahead.
For your information, theUS European Command announcedon March 16 (i.e. yesterday) that it would be scaled down. The US troop and equipment movement over the Atlantic would stop but that some parts of the exercise would move forward.
If there ever was a late reaction of a military whose duty is to be on the alert and react promptly, this is it.
That this was planned in the first place was madness – meaninglessly provocative, hundreds of millions of dollars wasted by countries that are all in an economic, debt and structural crisis.
It was madness to hold such thing, a provocation in the eyes of a world discussing climate change policies in what seems to be the 13th hour.
That it took the United States government, Pentagon, Army and US European Commandthatlong to perceive the reality only proves two things:
a) they live in their own world of denial and megalomania, and
b) they have absolutely no concern for real security, i.e. the security of their citizens.
Please note that the US European Command (EUCOM)has the guts to state that: ""The health, safety and readiness of our military, civilians, and family members is our primary concern.""
The primary concern is the Americans and not the citizens of Europe.
This statement comes daysafterPresident Trump announced that the US would no longer accept arrivals of civilian passenger planes from EU countries, with the exception of the UK!
And it comesafterPentagon banned all travels within the US for its own military personnel and their families amid the coronavirus!
So the US was ready to force its own military personnel and equipment – a high-risk corona phenomenon – on Europe while protecting itself from European civilians and it's own soldiers at home.
Could corona lead to even more militarism?
Did anybody say ""arrogant"" or ""selfish"" to the exercise and its far too late reduction?
Did we hear experts or politicians cry ""Outdated and out of touch in need of a reality check""?
Did you expect that? For instance that the former German defence minister in her new role of EU President should have presented that much common sense?
Oh no. Be sure – instead – thatthe next militarist campaignwill promote the idea thatthe military– together with ever more authoritarian but allegedly citizen-protecting governments, border controls and fences, laws limiting people's freedoms and movements between and inside states, more surveillance and emergency laws – will be our real Saviour. Defender. Protector. From both climate change and corona.
And the propaganda machines will continue to euphemistically call such societies civilian and democracies and help them antagonize ""dictatorships"".
Just think back on howSeptember 11has harmed the world because of the US ""victim"" overexploitation of it for its Global War On Terror.
My – admittedly – nasty peace mind tells me that the only real enemy we have is the blind belief in militarism. And that that is a larger threat to all of us than the economic crisis, climate change and COVID-19.

2020-03-18,Largest US -Led Military Exercise In Europe Continues Despite COVID-19 – OpEd,,"Nearly ten months on from the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, many countries eased restrictions, lockdowns and curfews in an attempt to stimulate their economies and commence the recovery process. Among these countries, Sri Lanka has made notable strides in controlling the spread of the virus thus far. However, moving out of a lockdown is no guarantee that the outbreak is being kept at bay, even while borders remain closed to the extent that they currently are, as demonstrated by recent evidence of the emergence of a new cluster. Until a vaccine is made available, it is vital that Sri Lankans build on the existing progress made in order to keep all communities safe and healthy going forward.
Sri Lanka has so far benefitted from the payoffs of an early lockdown. The country partially lifted its island-wide lockdown in mid-May and completely removed it by the end of June. Since then, we have seen an easing of inter-district travel restrictions, the opening of schools, universities, places of worship, restaurants and bars with safety measures in place, and a relaxing of attitudes towards social distancing guidelines in general. International borders remain closed for the foreseeable future, save for scheduled repatriation flights. Notably, general elections were held in August 2020 with stringent and exemplary precautionary measures in place, which were widely praised as being safe and efficient, despite initial concerns about crowds at polling stations.
In the months following the election, events, concerts, weddings and other large gatherings have taken place with varying degrees of social distancing and COVID-19 precautions observed. While temperature checks and handwashing/sanitization are still largely mandatory prior to entering public spaces, such guidelines were fast becoming simple cursory checks, with less enforcement as time went by with no reports of community spread in the country. This is especially true outside urban areas, where the use of masks and frequent sanitization have not yet been normalised.
In the wake of recent cluster outbreaks and the subsequent curfews issued in those police divisions, it is clear that these next few weeks could prove to be crucial for Sri Lanka's overall COVID-19 trajectory and for the island to maintain or do better than its current recovery rate of 73.4% as at 8 October 2020 (a drop from a previous rate of 93.9% as at 5 October, owing to the recent outbreaks).[1][1]While the rapid response in instituting a lockdown, establishing quarantine centres and contact tracing allowed for the containment of the virus during the previous lockdown period, taking a look at the feasibility of adopting and contextualisingadditionalbest practices from other successful countries could be useful in managing and/or preventing a second wave of the virus in Sri Lanka.
Taiwan, for instance, appears to have done very well in managing COVID-19 and avoiding further outbreaks. Its success is a result of a high degree of cooperation and collaboration across government and non-government entities in containing the virus, with quick, decisive decision-making and the use of technology to enable effective contact tracing and quarantine enforcement. Furthermore, it benefited from a high degree of public trust in government institutions and open and transparent communication with the public.[2][2]On the other hand, New Zealand, Iceland and Vietnam serve as examples of countries that were internationally lauded for their largely successful containment strategies and still succumbed to cluster and community outbreaks in the months since reopening. Nevertheless, all three countries combated these outbreaks with strict restrictions and rigorous testing and monitoring,[3][3]and have managed to bring their respective situations under control so as to allow for the easing of restrictions once again.[4][4]A quick review of new strategies employed in some of these countries that Sri Lanka could potentially consider are as follows:
Taiwan
New Zealand
Iceland
Building on previous experiences managing the 2003 SARS epidemic, the government established a National Health Command Centre (NHCC) that served as the unifying operational command point coordinating between central, regional and local authorities, thereby ensuring unified communication and targeted support.Taiwan also worked to integrate its national health insurance database with its immigration and customs database to allow for big data analysis and rapid contact tracing.
New Zealand developed a four-level COVID alert system, with the criteria for each level and the measures to be taken accordingly clearly set out. This information was made available in multiple languages on a central government website.The government also legally required businesses to comply with COVID-19 regulations as public health requirements, with clear guidelines on operating safely at each alert level.
The government paired up with a biotechnology company to offer free COVID tests to the public.Iceland also enforced paid leave for all employees that had to quarantine/isolate and decreed that private employees did not have to utilise their sick leave for COVID.Both these measures contributed towards removing barriers in access to tests and to incentivise workers to report symptoms without the fear of losing out on pay.
As we face a potential second wave with community spread, it is crucial that Sri Lanka looks back on the good practices instituted during the first lockdown. Global experiences have demonstrated that short-term mitigation methods will not suffice, as evidenced by occasional outbreaks in even the most prepared countries thus far. Constant vigilance and adherence to precautionary measures, such as the wearing of face masks and continued restrictions on public gatherings, will need to be normalised and enforced. Moreover, these measures should also be enforced uniformly and stringently, so as to ensure mask-wearing and social distancing are in practice in all reaches of the country, and not just within Colombo.
Any containment and mitigation measures taken by the government should be executed with ample transparency, so that communities are accepting of restrictions and to ensure that there is no room for misinformation that could potentially create panic. Unified communication is key to ensuring adherence to regulations. This requires information to be disseminated via a few selected, credible sources in all three languages; the Health Promotion Bureau, for instance, has developed a very user-friendly, trilingual website to disseminate COVID-related information.[5][5]Moreover, to ensure truly inclusive communications, information should also be circulated via visual/video and auditory means to ensure that persons with disabilities are also able to access news, guidelines and regulations. It is also imperative that media outlets adhere to ethical reporting practices, actively protect the security and privacy of potential patients, and avoid the stigmatisation of patients at all costs, which will only be counterproductive by leading to a reduction in people reporting their medical conditions, seeking medical care or adhering to regulations.
It is clear that the economy can ill-afford a second extended lockdown - therefore, Sri Lanka must look back on the good practices instituted during the first lockdown and how we can execute them better. Ensuring business continuity will not only be vital to safeguard livelihoods going forward, but also in minimizing the trade-off between prioritising economic and health safety, such that citizens will not have to make a choice between protecting their livelihoods and protecting themselves from COVID-19; this choice could potentially make a unified citizen-led response to the outbreak less effective, as citizens are more likely to de-prioritise COVID-19 etiquette.
Sri Lankan citizens and the government demonstrated their unified commitment to public health and agility in adapting to new circumstances when the entire country transitioned almost overnight to working remotely during the first lockdown. This agility needs to be supported to ensure the continuity of business while adhering to COVID-19 regulations. As some of us shift back towards remote and more flexible work arrangements, it is clear that we need improved infrastructure and even regulations to allow for a smooth transition and an eventual institutionalising of these practices in ways that would ensure no further disruption (to the extent possible) to education and economic activity. This could include for instance, amendments to existing legislation on work hours and remuneration practices, and the acknowledgement of unpaid care-work in combination with improved systems for childcare.
Sri Lanka still has the potential to capitalise on what is referred to as the 'COVID Dividend' and ensure the country's resilience to a pandemic and any other future shocks. The present resurgence of cases necessitates Sri Lanka taking the opportunity to explore, test and implement long-term solutions that will not only safeguard citizens' health, but also create avenues for the country to regain its development trajectory.

2020-10-08,Opinion: COVID-19 | Where do we go from here?,,"Almost 51% of Iranians are earning less money during the country's COVID-19 crisis which has led to the death of at least 32,800 people, a poll showed yesterday.
The state-run Iran Student Polling Agency (ISPA) said in a poll conducted between April 12 to April 15 that the income of 50.7% of people surveyed had decreased. According to the ISPA, 41.7% of the statistical population reported that their businesses were shut down following the COVID-19 outbreak, while 13.5% said they lost their jobs.
The Iranian regime lifted economic limitations in Tehran on Saturday. Businesses in other provinces resumed two weeks before, a move that has led to criticism against Rouhani's government.
Critics say that with the resumption of businesses, the possibility of the disease spreading increases and that the death toll will rise during the COVID-19 crisis.
The head of Tehran's COVID-19 Headquarters said today that there was a 7% increase in the number of patients in the ICU of hospitals in the capital.
Alireza Zali also said that 237 people infected with the virus were hospitalized while another 91 people were taken to the ICU in just one day.
The Tehran COVID-19 official also said that the number of people infected who were admitted to hospitals had increased by 3% in Tehran.
The regime maintains that only 5,209 people have died from the virus in Iran. But an opposition group that announces Iran's daily COVID-19 death figures says the regime is covering up the actual number of deaths.
The National Council of Resistance of Iran said today that at least 32,800 Iranians have passed away in 294 cities since the start of the epidemic.
Yesterday, the Arman state-run newspaper wrote that ""with the reopening of Tehran's bazaar and the high amount of traffic on the streets, a new wave of COVID-19 will soon break out in the country and millions of lives will be threatened.""
Also yesterday, Mohammad Reza Mehmandar, the head of Tehran's Traffic Police, announced that with the implementation of ""Smart Distancing"" the amount of traffic in the country's capital had almost doubled compared to the same day last year.
The police official also said that compared to last Saturday, ""we have had a 35% increase in traffic.""
Despite the resumption of economic activities, some Iranian officials have warned about the dire economic consequences of the COVID-19 disaster in Iran.
Quoting an Iranian lawmaker, the state-run Hamshahri daily warned of ""the horrific conditions of a post-COVID-19"" Iran.
Eman Abadi said that the current situation in the country suggests that Iran will face rising unemployment and inflation in post-coronavirus conditions.
""One million people will join those who are already unemployed after the COVID-19 epidemic,"" he said on April 18.

2020-04-21,Iran Poll: 51% Of Iranians Earn Less During COVID-19 Crisis – OpEd,,"India, April 13 -- Corona Virus has wreaked havoc all over the world. Thousand have been killed by this deadly virus. It is, after the 1918 Spanish flu, that such a large scale disruption has been caused to public life and that people have died at this scale, with no end in sight in the near future. Governments all over the world have been taking measures to tackle the pandemic. People have been asked to self-quarantine at their homes. Schools, colleges, universities, and all other offices have been shut down to prevent the spread of this virus and to prevent more deaths.
Indian doctors wait in an area set aside for possible COVID-19 patients at a free screening camp at a government run homeopathic hospital in New Delhi, India, Friday, March 13, 2020. The camp is part of the government's surveillance for fever and other symptoms related to the coronavirus. The vast majority of people recover from the new virus. According to the World Health Organization, people with mild illness recover in about two weeks, while those with more severe illness may take three to six weeks to recover. (AP Photo/Manish Swarup)
India has also adopted many measures and enforced a lockdown for 21 days that is likely to be extended. The brunt of this lockdown has been borne mostly by labourers and daily wagers who live hand-to-mouth. But, what India's right-wing and its many allies and the right-wing media have done wrong, even disgusting, is what any right-wing government does, by promoting myths, bigotry, and falsehoods for its larger design and above all vilify, stigmatise its Muslim minority, and launch a continuous campaign of Islamophobia.
First, a BJP party worker in West Bengal organised a cow urine consumption event, saying that it can prevent people from COVID-19 infection. Its other party workers, and some right-wing leaning academicians and even some public officials, have also endorsed that cow urine is like a medicine and can cure many diseases like cancer, diabetes, and heart attacks. BJP affiliated chief minister of Uttar Pradesh state, Yogi Adityanath supported the idea that Yoga can cure COVID-19 and India's high temperature and humidity can challenge its survival.
With the 'Thali and Tali Bajao' (Clap and banging of plates) event in the initial days of COVID-19 cases in India, Indian Prime Minister Modi demonstrated that people still believe him and his talks and theatrics. I believe it has exposed how PM Modi can make people believe myths with his 'oration' and how, in my opinion, he and his party has turned Indians a brainwashed bunch.
And after almost two weeks of the lockdown, Modi again asked the country to switch off the lights of their homes and come out with burning candles and diyas on April 5. This, BJP and many of its affiliates, believe is a step away from darkness from to light, and to dispel the darkness of COVID-19, which has more mythical than any scientific ground. But these things are dear to Modi and right-wing. Right-wing populists thrive on these kinds of myths and unscientific propaganda.
Then came the question of Muslims. The Indian media, which was feeling fatigued, and maybe many of its rabble-rousers were left idle during this lockdown, invented a new reason for COVID-19, the 'other', the Muslim of India. The disease has been criminalised. Tablighi Jamaat at Delhi's Nizamuddin Markaz became the target. Fake videos and other stuff related to Islamophobia got circulated on social media within no time.
Some tried to name it ""Corona Jihad"" to vilify Muslims and Tabligh members. The media, within no time, started a campaign asking for the arrest of all Jamaat members and linked the group with many international terror outfits. On April 5, some people fired on a mosque in Gurugramm near Haryana. The accused confessed to the police that they fired on ""Jamatis"" for reportedly spreading COVID-19 and that they were instigated by WhatsApp messages. Muslims have been attacked and one Muslim man, Mehboob Ali, was beaten to death by a mob in Delhi's Bawan for supposedly attending a Tableeghi event.
The right-wing is finding one excuse after another to further its agenda of myth, bigotry, and hatred for minorities. It's pertinent to mention here only some Hindus and Sikhs came to the rescue of Muslims during the recently Delhi riots in which around 60 people were killed, mostly Muslims. The majority middle and lower-middle-class population, which forms the big chunk of BJP voters, have been seemingly swayed by right-wing jingoism and bigotry, and now many from this class have called to boycott the Muslim businesses.
And after almost two weeks of the lockdown, Modi again asked the country to switch off the lights of their homes and come out with burning candles and diyas on April 5.
And in the first week of April, almost eight months after the Indian government stripped Jammu and Kashmir of its autonomy, the BJP government at the center, by taking the benefit of COVID-19 lockdown came up with a new domicile law. The law allowed citizens of mainland India to buy land and apply for government jobs in Jammu and Kashmir which previously was denied thanks to Article 370 (Note: this has since been amended). Many compared this law with an Israel-type annexation and land grabbing. High-speed internet remains suspended in Jammu and Kashmir.
Indian press freedom is at its lowest. The Indian government has muzzled press freedom by shutting down channels, stopping advertisements to channels and newspapers after slight criticism. Many journalists and rationalists have been killed before for airing their views on several social matters and government policies.
Recently Modi convened a meeting of top news executives, allegedly urging them to publish only the aegood news' about and of the government. Entry and reporting of foreign journalists have been curtailed. It's pertinent to mention here Press in Jammu and Kashmir is still under censorship and news, views and articles regarding India's clampdown and revocation of article 370 are not being published in local dailies and magazines.
The media clampdown started with the Kashmir story on August, 5 and many believe that they toed the government line when it came to the human rights abuses in Kashmir last year. According to many, a large section of the Indian media has become a lap dog, not a watchdog, referring to the right-wing Indian media which simply toes the line of the government and is full of Islamophobia and fake and jingoistic reporting.
It is becoming clear day by day that the ruling government is a master at is myth, bigotry, hatred and it is because of these tools it wants to retain the power. From Thali and Tali Bajao to Diya and Gau Mutra, BJP and PM Modi, a populist, is playing its cards well and where it is best at, to make its voters further dumb, and to keep them busy in unimportant things, to fill the society with more bigotry, hatred, and jingoism and to hide its failures on economic, employment and healthcare front. And so far it has succeeded in doing so, but at the cost of India's already fading secularism and democracy.

2020-04-13,"Opinion: COVID-19, Right-Wing Myths And The 'Other'",,"Canberra: Commonwealth Secretariat, Australia has issued the following news release:
A lethal combination of disease, extreme climate events and economic crises is threatening the smallest and most vulnerable nations of the world. To tackle it, we must overhaul how we understand and address economic vulnerability.
The COVID-19 pandemic has already triggered a massive global recession. Meanwhile, a record number of super cyclones have wreaked havoc in Asia and the Pacific while the Caribbean braces itself for up to six major Atlantic hurricanes over the coming months.
There is good reason to feel anxious. When Hurricane Maria struck my native Dominica in 2017, it obliterated 226 percent of annual economic output, to say nothing of the emotional and psychological pain of having communities destroyed and lives lost. More recently, Cyclone Harold ploughed through Vanuatu, Tonga and Fiji, incurring US$750 million of damage, while exacerbating the risk of exposure to COVID-19.
Very often after hurricanes, countries must borrow heavily to rebuild their crippled economies, pushing them further into debt.
For the 32 disaster-prone 'small states' in the Commonwealth – most of whom have a population of 1.5 million or less – the reality is that COVID-19 profoundly compounds the ongoing risks they already face on a daily basis. Not only are they highly vulnerable to climate change and natural disasters, but their remote locations, high levels of debt, scant domestic markets and limited range of exports further expose them to other external shocks.
Within a few months, COVID-19 has ravaged their tourism industries, which contribute up to 50 percent of national income in countries such as Maldives and Grenada, while slashing a fifth of vital remittance inflows. Overall, Commonwealth small states are set to lose 8.6 pe cent of projected economic growth, with knock-on effects such as unprecedented levels of unemployment and disruption to social services.
Yet, despite the patent vulnerabilities they share, many small states are excluded from vital international financial support designed to help cope with COVID-19, including debt relief. This is due to outdated eligibility criteria based mainly on per capita income which classifies them as 'middle' or 'high income' countries, without fully taking into account their current challenges.
For example, the IMF has offered USD213.4 million worth of COVID-19 related debt relief to 29 of the poorest and most vulnerable nations. While commendable, the initiative will only benefit six of 54 Commonwealth countries - The Gambia, Malawi, Mozambique, Rwanda, Sierra Leone and Tanzania. It will not cover any of the 25 small island developing states in the Commonwealth, which remain prone to the existential threat of climate change.
Similarly, the G20 has offered to temporarily suspend debt repayments for more than 70 countries classified as 'least developed countries' or which meet certain criteria under the World Bank International Development Association. In this case, 30 Commonwealth countries are eligible, but a number of small vulnerable states such as Jamaica, Belize and Eswatini do not qualify because their average annual income per person is above the US$1,175 threshold, or they are deemed creditworthy enough to borrow from other funds.
So, while acknowledging these huge efforts of the global community to deal with the financial impacts of the pandemic, it is clear the nature and size of the support on offer is simply not enough.
Still, the extraordinary circumstances brought about by COVID-19 offer a rare opportunity to reform the international debt architecture so it is more fit-for-purpose.
Most urgent is that the moratorium on external debt repayments is extended to all developing countries – including small and vulnerable states classified as middle or high income – recognising their specific vulnerabilities.
The Commonwealth Secretariat's ongoing work on a Universal Economic Vulnerability Index will also be vital. Still in development, this index aims to better capture different aspects of vulnerability – such as remoteness, economic exposure and proneness to natural disasters – rather than focus on per capita income alone.
We hope to build a consensus among our members on the definition and measurement of vulnerability, to help us better understand the needs of countries in crisis and propose the best solutions.","EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (99%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (90%); HURRICANES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); NEGATIVE ECONOMIC NEWS (90%); NEGATIVE NEWS (90%); WEATHER (90%); DEVELOPMENT BANKS (89%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (89%); BUSINESS NEWS (78%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (78%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (78%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (78%); EMERGING MARKETS (78%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (78%); NEGATIVE ENVIRONMENTAL NEWS (78%); OUTPUT & DEMAND (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (78%); RECESSION (78%); SAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (78%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (77%); NATURAL DISASTERS (77%); ECONOMIC NEWS (76%); ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (75%); EPIDEMICS (73%); NEGATIVE EMPLOYMENT NEWS (73%); PANDEMICS (73%); UNEMPLOYMENT RATES (73%); EMOTIONS (72%); EXPORT CONTROLS (69%); PERSONAL & FAMILY INCOME (63%)

2020-07-27,OPINION: COVID-19 debt relief must consider the vulnerabilities of small states,,"Claude Smadja is president of Smadja & Smadja, a strategic advisory firm in Switzerland. He was also the former managing director of the World Economic Forum from 1995 to 2001.
There is an expanding sea of red ink, as far as the eye can see in the context of a generalized deep recession, in which most countries' GDPs are expected to shrink between 3% and 10%. This is one key feature of the emerging global economic picture - making Covid-19 not only an unprecedented modern day pandemic, but also an economic, political and leadership challenge of planetary dimension.
The response to the crisis has been an extraordinary effort by governments to mobilize monetary and fiscal policy tools to help their respective economies absorb the shock created by the freezing of almost all business activity as one country after another went into lockdown. By the end of March-early April, $5 trillion worth of additional debt had been created to contain the economic and social damage worldwide. But this was insufficient as the severity of the crisis was becoming more obvious by the day, and pressure was growing for more support to avoid a full economic collapse.
So, one can expect that before the end of May the overall total of stimulus packages around the world - grants, helicopter money, guaranteed government loans, treasury bond issuances, expanded quantitative easing programs - will amount to at least $9 trillion. Most of this will add to the already existing $13 trillion of negative yielding bonds. Even before the development of the pandemic, the International Institute of Finance was putting total global debt at more than $257 trillion and the global debt-to-GDP ratio at around 325% by the first quarter of 2020. All these projections have now been blown up as corporations are piling up debt and new stimulus measures are sending countries' debt-to-GDP ratios through the roof.
In Europe, Italy's sovereign debt-to-GDP ratio is expected to grow from 130% to 150% or even 160% by the end of the pandemic; France's from just below 100% to 115% to 118%, Germany's from 60% to more than 75%. America's debt-to-GDP ratio - now at 106% - will go up to around 120%.
China, still struggling to mitigate financial risk and reduce its overall domestic debt-to-GDP ratio of 300%, is trying to calibrate its support measures and the further loosening of its monetary policy to get its economy into at least neutral territory by the end of the year, after the 6.8% GDP decline in the first quarter. Nevertheless, Beijing will have to cope with an even higher level of debt. Japan's sovereign debt - the highest in the world at 237% of GDP - is expected to reach 250%.
Will all this money sloshing around mean a return of inflation or/and higher interest rates? Definitely not in a context where the global economy is expected to contract by anywhere between 3% to 5% this year and where prospects for a V-shaped recovery are quickly evaporating - as a more realistic forecast might be at best a U-shaped one, consolidating by 2022.
However, the key point here is how this global sea of red ink will impact growth prospects in the medium and longer term post Covid-19. It would be extremely unlikely to see interest rates rise in the foreseeable future considering the pattern that we have seen after the 2008-2009 financial crisis and the deflationary impact that the pandemic will have on supply as well as on demand at the global level. The positive factor is that it will help service the huge amounts of debt incurred by governments and the private sector. Central banks will be ready to keep quantitative easing programs alive as long as needed to sustain a recovery. This will be even as the urgency to repair or contain the damage created by the pandemic will put pressure on governments not to engage into any kind of belt-tightening. Austerity is going to be a dirty word in the coming period and the preoccupation for balancing budgets will come much later into this decade.
As countries - and the global economy - will have to accommodate to life with high debt, one key risk is that a number of developing or emerging market countries could go into default if they are forced to increase debt beyond their servicing capabilities to avoid a social and economic collapse. This is where conditional extension of maturities and calibrated write-offs will come into play - not out of the goodness of lenders' hearts but rather out of smart self-interest.
We are not yet there as a lot of uncertainty remains about how, when, and at what total economic and social cost this pandemic will be tamed. Nevertheless, some key consequences of this crisis are already emerging.
First, the post Covid European Union will be more divided than ever. The Southern countries hit hardest by the pandemic will continue to nurse grudges against their northern neighbors and their refusal of genuine financial solidarity. French President Emmanuel Macron is definitely right in asserting that any solution claiming to help countries such as Italy and Spain overcome the crisis just kicking the can of an aggravated debt burden down the road and not demonstrating genuine financial solidarity will create an existential threat to the whole European project.
Second, the pandemic will widen the existing differential between France and Germany's economic might as Berlin entered the crisis - and will come out of it - in a much stronger position financially and economically than Paris. And Germany has so far suffered more than three times fewer fatalities from the pandemic than France. This will hamper even more President Macron's efforts to impose his vision of Europe on his reluctant partners to the east and north, which we will keep the EU and the eurozone in their present half-baked mode.
Third, Germany and China will be among the top countries to emerge first from the crisis as they are one step ahead of the curve. And this is true despite all of China's structural economic issues and despite the vulnerabilities that have grown more apparent in the German economic and growth model. Both Beijing and Berlin have the ability to mobilize strong resources, and their solid relationship and very strong economic and business connections - China is Germany's No. 1 trading partner - will create synergies between them as they strive to revive their economies.
Fourth, there will be no Covid 19 winner in the soft power competition between Washington and Beijing. China's image will suffer from the consequences of its lack of transparency at the beginning of the pandemic, and the Trump administration has made of its management of the pandemic a case study of incompetence and incoherence - which would be laughable if the consequences were not so tragic.
However, when it comes to hard power, expect China - maybe not in the short term, but indeed in the medium term - to emerge from this crisis in a stronger economic position than the U.S., and presumably with some geopolitical gains as the pandemic has demonstrated to almost every country that it was not possible to count on the U.S. in emergency situations. Whoever succeeds Donald Trump at the White House will have to take on the daunting task of restoring American credibility.
We are just beginning to fathom the shape of the post-Covid economic and geopolitical global landscape.

2020-05-21,Opinion: Covid-19 Will Change the World's Economic and Geopolitical Landscape,,"Jul 10, 2020( Deutsche Welle World: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429 Delivered by Newstex)  Africa's population is the fastest-growing in the world. Yet sexual and reproductive health and rights are being neglected amid the pandemic with dire consequences, says Evelyn Samba on World Population Day (July 11th).Africa, along with the rest of the world, is currently responding to the COVID-19 pandemic with over 320,000 confirmed COVID-19 cases across the continent so far. Many African governments have put in place measures to shore up their economies and to cushion their citizens from a downturn in earnings. 
However, discussions about the effect of COVID-19 on other aspects of life, such as reproductive healthcare, and the well-being of women and girls at risk of gender-based violence, have been largely neglected.This has already had dire effects on reproductive, maternal, new-born, child and adolescent health in Africa.The disruption to access to sexual and reproductive health services in Africa is putting pregnant women and their families at increased risk. And this isn't just a short-term problem.More unsafe births, less access to contraceptives and increased risk of contracting sexually transmitted disease also have long-term impacts on women, their families and societies. In Zimbabwe, the number of caesarean sections performed decreased by 42%, and in April only 15% of births took place with skilled health attendants compared to last year. Access to contraceptives in many areas has decreased by 90%. In some parts of Kenya, only a quarter of pregnant women were able to go to antenatal clinics.Access to public health services is vitalMillions of Africans depend on public health institutions for reproductive health. The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) in a report found that in times of crisis, reproductive health needs are likely to be overlooked. But even during the COVID-19 pandemic, African governments need to keep providing reproductive healthcare services.That means, at the very minimum, the public health sector must be able to address complications of pregnancy and delivery, the transmission of sexually transmitted infections including HIV and AIDS, adolescent sexual and reproductive health concerns, and ensure access to condoms and other contraceptives.Midwives need to be able to visit women and information campaigns need to continue even when everyone wears a facemask. And even during the pandemic, African women, and their partners, need to have a satisfying and safe sex life - and be able to choose if and when they want to have children.If that is not ensured, countries across Africa are likely to see an increase in sexually transmitted infections, including HIV, increased unintended pregnancies and unsafe abortions as well as a rise in maternal and neonatal deaths. Even before the pandemic, manyMore focus on reproductive health needsAfrican governments were struggling with these issues. Many also did not manage to meet funding requirements for health - including sexual and reproductive healthcare.Despite progress over the years, many African women and girls are still unable to enjoy their reproductive rights. Far too many women do not have access to moderncontraceptives, too many adolescents and young people are getting pregnant and getting infected with HIV. Maternal deaths are still unacceptably high. Sub-Saharan Africa accounted for 66% of the estimated global maternal deaths in 2017.Improvements achieved over decades are now at stake if we do not pay attention to reproductive healthcare amid the pandemic.The silver lining is that we have commitment from the highest political office on reproductive healthcare. At theNairobi Summiton the 25th anniversary of the International Conference on Population and Development (ICPD +25) in 2019, African governments committed to provide much needed family planning information and services, to end preventable maternal deaths and maternal injuries, as well as stopping sexual and gender-based violence and harmful practices.As African governments reorganize public health systems to respond to COVID-19, decision makers need to keep in mind that, at the same time, it is also imperative to provide adequate funding to meet the reproductive healthcare needs of African women and their partners.Evelyn Samba is the Kenya country director of the German Foundation for World Population (DSW). The NGO works in several African countries and in Europe on sustainable and rights-based population development issues. One its main focuses is ensuring access to sexual and reproductive health and rights services for women and young people.","EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (99%); EPIDEMICS (94%); PUBLIC HEALTH (92%); SEXUAL & REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); FAMILY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); OBSTETRICS & GYNECOLOGY (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); POPULATION SIZE (90%); WOMEN'S HEALTH (90%); AIDS & HIV (89%); CONTRACEPTION (89%); PREGNANCY & CHILDBIRTH (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (89%); REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH CLINICS (89%); SEXUALLY TRANSMITTED DISEASE (89%); WOMEN (89%); GENDER EQUALITY (78%); ADOLESCENTS & TEENS (77%); BIRTHS & BIRTH RATES (77%); CHILDREN'S HEALTH (77%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (77%); HEALTH CARE ACCESS (77%); HEALTH CARE POLICY (77%); MATERNAL & CHILD HEALTH (77%); POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS (77%); SEX & GENDER ISSUES (77%); SEXUAL BEHAVIOR (77%); SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLE (77%); HEALTH CARE SECTOR PERFORMANCE (74%); GENDER BASED VIOLENCE (73%); INFANTS & TODDLERS (73%); GENDER & SEX DISCRIMINATION (72%); NEGATIVE MISC NEWS (72%); REPRODUCTIVE RIGHTS (72%); MIDWIVES (71%); PREGNANCY COMPLICATIONS (71%); UNITED NATIONS (68%); INFANT MORTALITY (67%); ABORTION (66%); SURGERY & TRANSPLANTATION (66%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (62%); World (%)

2020-07-10,Opinion: COVID-19 pandemic threatens Africa's gains in reproductive healthcare,,"The Supreme Leader of the Iranian regime banned the import of COVID-19 vaccines made by the US and UK in a televised speech today.
""If the US and Pfizer can make vaccines, they should use it themselves to prevent so many of their deaths,"" Ali Khamenei said.
The regime's Supreme Leader called these vaccines ""untrustworthy"" adding that the US and UK wanted to ""test their vaccines on other nations"". He also endorsed the so-called ""Iran made"" vaccine that was supposedly tested on volunteers last week. Khamenei called this vaccine ""the country's pride"".
Following Khamenei's remarks, the spokesperson for Iran's Red Crescent said Iran's request for Pfizer vaccines had been canceled. The Red Crescent had said on December 28 that 150,000 Pfizer vaccines would be imported to Iran with the help of American ""charities"".
Before this, in late March 2020, Ali Khamenei claimed that the COVID-19 virus was ""specifically built for Iran using the genetic data of Iranians"" and refused US assistance in fighting the deadly virus that has killed over 198,000 people in Iran.
We all know that the US and many other countries have started vaccinating millions of people with ""US-made"" vaccines and that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines have been authorized for use by top health organizations around the world. Khamenei knows that too.
In fact, top regime officials travel to Europe and the US for treatment all the time and receive the best treatment and medicine money can buy from the ""Great Satan"". I am pretty sure Khamenei is one of them.
It is a well-known fact that the children of regime officials are Europe and US educated and pride themselves in living abroad often flaunting their lavish lifestyles on the internet.
So why is Khamenei suddenly concocting conspiracy theories that make him look like a senile old man?
Because he wants an excuse to delay vaccination as much as possible. Unlike other world leaders, he does not care about the thousands of deaths from the virus in the worst-hit Middle Eastern country. In fact, the regime's policies from the beginning of the pandemic have facilitated coronavirus deaths. If anything, the pandemic has aided the regime and has thus far prevented major protests, the likes of which erupted in Iran in 2019 and early 2020 following the IRGC's shootdown of Ukrainian flight PS752.
Khamenei's ban has angered Iranians, many of whom are expressing their not so very nice opinions about Iran's dictator on the internet as I type.
Will this new vaccine ban coupled with economic grievances lead to street protests? We will have to wait and see. But one thing is very clear. COVID-19 will not stay forever, even if Khamenei wills it.

2021-01-10,Don't Be Fooled By Khamenei's COVID-19 Conspiracy Theories – OpEd,,"As expected, Germany beat Iceland in their first World Cup qualifier. DW's Jonathan Harding believes that playing hours after a player tested positive for COVID-19 leaves questions about Germany's priorities.
Germany started their qualifying campaign off with the win expected of them. In one of their best displays in months, their midfield was excellent, Jamal Musiala made his debut and their new away kit looked slick. But rather than how Germany won the game, it was the lengths they went to play it that was the most telling.
Without question, the team's Premier League players were flown in to join the squad. Germany reached an agreement with the local health department that saw those five players bubble inside the Germany bubble, effectively meaning other than training, games and team meetings, they were on their own.
Team doctor Tim Meyer has, according to Joachim L\xF6w, constantly been running after the head coach - presumably from a safe distance - telling him all about the procedures to follow. Masks were worn, distances were being kept in team and one-on-one meetings.
On the morning of the game, it was announced that Borussia M\xF6nchengladbach midfielder Jonas Hofmann had tested positive for COVID-19. He was then placed in quarantine. Marcel Halstenberg, who was deemed a ""first degree contact person"", having played backgammon with Hofmann on Wednesday evening, returned to Leipzig to quarantine. Not long afterwards, chief press officer Jens Grittner relayed the message that Germany would ""definitely be playing.""
Deja vu
The news was hardly surprising. After a similar situation in November last year, when Germany met Ukraine, the game went ahead with little hesitation. But at what point does this association, do these players, ask whether it is worth the risk?
Germany did everything they could to make sure they could play. As footballers, and as an association with contractual obligations, that is understandable. But at what point do you consider the human being?
After all, despite Meyer's new procedures, bubbles for Premier League players, rapid and PCR tests, ubitquitous FFP2 masks during leisure activities such as playing board games, there was still a case of COVID-19.
""We are people too and it affects us just as much,"" Ilkay G\xFCndogan said afterwards, of the impact of the Hofmann case.
This virus does not care if you are an international footballer. It doesn't care how exciting Germany looked, who played in attack or who made their debut.
Identity questions
Rapid tests done on Thursday delivered the desired negative results, but if symptoms can take anywhere between 2-14 days to appear, then who are you really kidding? What do you really care about?
While Germany battles a third wave of the coronavirus as a nation, Germany the football team continues to show that whatever happens, no matter the potential risks, they will keep playing.
For a team apparently keen on reconnecting with its fans and showing that it is not completely detached from the country it represents, this was a night when it did everything but.

2021-03-29,Germany : Opinion: Germany 's COVID-19 misstep,,"Critics pointed to hesitancy and misinformation after Malawi discarded 20,000 expired COVID-19 shots. The reality is far more complicated
My home country, Malawi, has made international headlines for discarding COVID-19 vaccines. Many fingers have pointed to hesitancy and misinformation, but the reality is far more complicated, and increasingly concerning.
In fact, the unused doses are consequences of failures to support the complex delivery system that gets vaccines into arms. And the effects on people's lives are dire - for COVID-19 and other health emergencies.
First though, I want to set the record straight. In March, Malawi received a shipment of 102,000 vaccine doses 18 days before their labeled expiration date. Despite this, Malawi managed to administer nearly 90% of those doses in time - a testament to the country's skill and experience conducting mass vaccination campaigns.
Of course, while we made gallant efforts to accelerate delivery, that wasn't enough to use up every dose, and we all know that every vaccine matters right now. With limited time and resources, we could only accelerate so much.
So let's take a look at why that was, as our experience may illuminate what's happening in other countries rolling out COVID-19 vaccines.
One of the major challenges we faced was limited access. We could only open a few vaccination sites as both demand and supply were still ramping up. Opening sites also carries financial considerations, such as staffing, training and management overhead - and when resources are limited and there are not enough doses for more sites, it is hard to justify the expense.
The domino effect was that some people had to travel long distances to reach vaccination sites, affecting uptake and equitable access. Most sites are currently located in urban areas, but few in rural locations. A relative of mine shared that in his home district people had to travel 40 kilometers to reach the closest vaccination site. This amounted to hours away from work, at a time when we are seeing considerable economic impact from the pandemic.
As we prepare for the next phase of rollout, we need to ensure that we're investing in and building the critical infrastructure that allows us to get vaccines flowing into communities.
Another challenge was generating demand for the vaccine - and that meant more than addressing misinformation. In Malawi, we moved fast to conduct a public information campaign and community outreach that would help people understand the risk of COVID-19 and why the vaccines are important. This was complicated by the fact that we're facing multiple health emergencies. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic has severely curtailed services to diagnose and treat HIV around the country.
However, we did see impressively high turnout, just not high enough. Our demand generation budget was not fully funded, so we were limited in what we could do. Further, for our awareness-building activities to bear fruit, they needed to be synchronized with adequate supply so that when people asked for the vaccine, they could get it. That wasn't the case.
Finally, we needed a strong supply chain and information system to streamline distribution. When vaccines could not be administered at a site, staff were on the phone calling other sites and hurriedly driving vaccines across the country, moving them to new locations when needed to realign supply with demand. A strong data system would have helped expedite this process.
Malawi knows how to vaccinate large populations, we've been doing it for decades. Unfortunately, as the world has been rallying around the importance of procuring doses for low- and middle-income countries, conversations about delivery once those doses arrive in the country have not taken place with the same fervor.
Our recent experience with COVID-19 vaccines makes clear that we need to reexamine and address all the factors that impact our ability to get vaccines into arms - ensuring adequate and predictable supply, supporting all facets of delivery systems that help us scale up, and funding critical health infrastructure and information campaigns for the long-run.
Ultimately, equitable vaccine delivery will require procuring enough vaccine doses for everyone, wherever they are. But we cannot forget all the pieces of the puzzle that must come together to effectively deliver vaccines. After all it's vaccinations, not vaccines, that protect people.

2021-06-21,Opinion - Why Malawi Burnt Thousands of Covid-19 Vaccines [opinion],,"Health authorities in Monrovia joined by senior officials of the Government of Liberia and foreign diplomats received the first consignment of 96,000 doses of the coronavirus vaccine at the Roberts International Airport in Margibi County on Friday, March 5, 2021.
According to the Ministry of Health, the consignment is the first of a total of 384,000 Covid-19 vaccine doses expected in the country and that formal vaccination commences within two weeks, starting with health care workers, members of the executive, the Legislature, the Judiciary branches of government, followed by the Military and para-military, marketers and the general population.
United States Ambassador to Liberia Michael A. McCarthy, speaking at the RIA Friday, congratulated the Government of Liberia for its continued commitment to reducing transmission and curbing the spread of COVID-19 both in the country and in the region.
However, Ambassador McCarthy warned that the work does not stop here, hoping that Liberians will take the opportunity to receive safe and effective vaccines, if offered. And this is where our concern lies: Effective and impartial administration of the vaccine doses to protect the population. We do not want this exercise to be conducted the ""Liberian way"" where personal interest overrides the general good.
We recall vividly during the peak of the Coronavirus in 2019 when front-liners such as doctors, nurses, midwives and other health workers were left unprotected due to lack of PPEs despite emergency funds provided by donors.
Bureaucratic bottlenecks and political influence suffocated a process that should have been professionally handled thus, leading to the deaths of several doctors and nurses.This time around, we hope that things would be done differently, so that areas and people that are most in need, including the elderly would get preference.
Authorities at the Ministry of Health should be able to advise the President on the way to proceed, because COVID-19 vaccine doses are intended to stabilize the entire population, beginning with most-at-risk persons such as health workers, security forces manning our borders and residents in congested communities.
As Ambassador McCarthy cautioned, the work does not stop at receiving the doses of vaccine. No, they are not to be stacked in warehouses and in private clinics for personal gains while the population remains vulnerable. Rather, we should endeavor to reach the most needed in order to make impact.","VACCINES (94%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); FOREIGN RELATIONS (90%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (90%); PUBLIC OFFICIALS (90%); VIRUSES (90%); DIPLOMATIC SERVICES (89%); NURSES & NURSING (89%); PROFESSIONAL WORKERS (86%); PRIVATE HEALTH CARE (79%); EMBASSIES & CONSULATES (78%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (73%); PARAMILITARY & MILITIA (70%); SENIOR CITIZENS (62%); MIDWIVES (50%); Liberia (%); Coronavirus (%)

2021-03-07,"Welcoming the 96,000 Covid-19 Vaccine Doses [opinion]",,"The outbreak of the novel coronavirus has not only impacted human and social life in terms of disease and infection but also created a controversy in the international media and social network to the point that some western media fell into the trap of racism and xenophobia showing an unusual and an inhuman reactions, instead of solidarity and unity exhibition.
Since China is the first country infected with this virus, so it has already started its fight, the government as a leader has put a clear and effective strategy with successful measures of treatment, protection and prevention. In order to maintain the situation the government dedicated all kind of resources and today's statics shows an increasing of the confirmed infections and death cases and a considered decrease of healed people's number.
As a matter of fact, the World Health Organization' Chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus has defended his earlier praise of China's response to the outbreak and mentioned that all the member of the WHO has praised China for what it did by taking action in the epicenter, helped to prevent cases of being exported to other provinces in china and the rest of the world. This formal statement just confirmed the truth to the world about China's reliability and the sacrifices made to safeguard the world.
All Chinese government's management and measures wouldn't be successful without the great response of the society. As a matter of fact we need to acknowledge the high level of patriotism of the Chinese citizens. No matter their social status; the military, police, engineers, workers, doctors and nurses, business and company owners, celebrities, civilians and ordinary people, students and volunteers, young-middle-old generations, all this people responded to the call of duty applied and followed meticulously all the recommended measures by the government, indeed by their own free will, they sacrificed wealth, made many donations, provided help and assistance donated free masks , free supplies, goods, food and even provided free services, and differently some people made a priceless contribution such the doctors, fully dedicated, working on clock on the front line risking and even sacrificing their lives to save other people's lives.
Meantime, in the other side of the globe the coronavirus kept spreading, the virus is traveling the world it has no boundaries and it's affecting the economy, the social life and the public health, it becomes a public enemy, presenting a threat especially for the African communities, in fact many of them they do not have neither the financial means nor a good health security. But since the outbreak of COVID-19, the Africa CDC (Center for Disease Control and Prevention) took many actions and followed the Chinese in term of union and solidarity.
Indeed Africa CDC collaborated with the World Health Organization to train in-coming analysts in event-based surveillance. Also The Africa CDC has been working with member states to build infection prevention and control capacities in healthcare facilities and with the airline sector to support screening of travelers.
These prevention measures may help control the COVID-19, but African leaders still need to pay attention and follow suit to avoid an outbreak and not reproduce the Italian or Iranian scenarios. Recently, World Health Organization chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warned about the efficiency of the prevention measures and said mediocre preparations could have fatal consequences. He also said the real struggle lies in management of the situation in case of an outbreak.
Generally, Africa doesn't have a high level of public health. Many diseases and viruses have appeared on the continent, such as HIV, Ebola and tuberculosis. In order to fight and eliminate this threat, a number of African governments have increased expenditures allocated to health and started cooperation for health development with the Chinese government.
China promised to continue to scale up assistance to African countries by creating a health care intuitive allowing the African countries to achieve independent and sustainable development. The plan also contain a long-term strategy of health development, exchange of scientists and new research and technical support for strengthening health-related capacities under the International Health Regulations. China aim to improve African medical and health service and hospital management to provide a better services to the African people by training medical staff, public health workers and administrative personnel. Besides China promised to upgrade its medical and health aid programs for Africa, particularly flagship projects such as the headquarters of the African Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
The cooperation's plan shows the Chinese-African comity, the friendship and the mutual respect and we can clearly see that China is determined to the contribution in the development of the African nations. The actual epidemic situation of the COVID19 in Africa needs more attention and prevention, the collaboration precisely with china will be a wise action considering the Chinese experience of management, logistics, and organization to maintain the situation in case of outbreak and bringing out the best of the Sino-African alliance.
Despite that China is still fighting this epidemic in its own territory, the government express his readiness to help the other infected countries, recently the Chinese Foreign Ministry expresses sincere thanks for the support and assistance provided by many countries such South Korea and Japan, adding that China is ready to improve and strengthen the mechanism of responding to health and epidemic emergencies and promote the exchange of epidemiological information, exchange of experiences, prevention and control, to implement cooperation In the areas of diagnosis, treatment, research programs, and the development of medicines and vaccines.
China is acting heroically; in the middle of its own fight against the virus the PRC still showing gratitude and good will to help others countries. Till now Africa still has the chance to prevent and learn the Chinese experience, sadly some Africans countries still didn't take serious prevention measures but China can provide the help and the assistance.
During the outbreak of the COVID-19 we all have seen the Chinese citizen showing patriotism and helping to maintain the situation, meanwhile the Chinese government have shown the same to the world, the lockdown was a strategy to stop the virus from spreading globally, if the Chinese government didn't take the decision to lockdown cities and stop flights and traffics, experts confirmed that the COVID-19 could infect much more of global population, in fact it was a noble and human act, full of altruism and unselfish, all the matter was the human life.
Now China jumps to the next step which is helping the affected countries and proposing ways of preventions, sharing the genetic code for the virus with researchers around the world and providing medical trials information, treatment, and research programs for the development of medicines.
It's time for solidarity and support and to have hope. This is a matter of life or death, and China can fight against the outbreak with the rest of the world to the safety…. to restore faith in humanity.

2020-05-27,From Patriotism To Humanity: China Leading The Fight Of The COVID-19 – OpEd,,"The President, Nana Addo Dankwa Akufo-Addo, on Sunday ushered the country into the second phase of the fight against the coronavirus disease, also known as COVID-19.
As a result, he has eased restrictions covering worshipping in churches, attendance at entertainment sites, transportation, football activities among others.
The lifting of the latest restrictions is in addition to those that were earlier lifted in the first phase of the fight against the pandemic.
In easing the restrictions, the President acknowledged that the country was gradually moving on the path to defeat COVID-19 and urged all to continue to wear face masks and maintain enhanced hygiene protocols.
""As I have said before, the phased opening of our country puts individual obligation and responsibility on each of us, which means that we must continue to remain vigilant and respect the enhanced hygiene, mask wearing, and social distancing protocol that have become part and parcel of our daily routine. We dare not ruin the successes we have chalked over the period.
""As we work towards defeating this virus, we should reject completely those who perpetrate falsehood, thereby, creating fear and panic and call them out when they do. Truth would always triumph over lies,"" he said.
The Ghanaian Times is delighted that the country appears to be heading in the right direction with regard to the fight against the coronavirus pandemic.
This is because the disease has been causing a lot of havoc across the world but available data indicate that the country is on the path to curbing the spread of the disease.
""A closer look at the data indicate that the country is steadily on the path towards limiting and containing the virus and, ultimately, defeating it.
""The figure to look out for is the number of active cases and when I delivered update 13, the number of active cases that is, those who as of June 27, 2020 had the virus, stood at 4,245, but as of midnight July 24, nearly a month later, the number of active cases in Ghana stands at 3,307,"" he said.
The data speaks for itself and it is obvious that the active cases are going down and therefore we must be doing something right.
It is against this backdrop that we encourage all Ghanaians to continue to strictly observe the health protocols in order to keep the disease at bay.
It is regrettable that with all the public education and effort being made by majority of Ghanaians to prevent the spread of the disease, many others, have just refused to adhere to the safety protocols.
We remind Ghanaians once again that there is no vaccine for the disease and it is the responsibility of each of us to ensure that the disease is contained and possibly defeated.","COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); VIRUSES (91%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH (89%); SAFETY (89%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); DISINFORMATION & MISINFORMATION (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (78%); VACCINES (73%); Ghana (%); Coronavirus (%)

2020-07-28,Let's Not Lower Our Guard in the Fight Against COVID-19 [opinion],,"ABSTRACT
How our success in preventing widespread pandemic illness and death can inform the future of Australian training and skills institutions.
FULL TEXT
The chances of a second coronavirus wave in Australia -- especially in the 'warmer' virus spots of New South Wales and Victoria -- remain, but we all know that we have 'dodged a bullet'. 

We are living through momentous times, an historical inflection point that experts will study well into the next century. What did Australia do right? Why were we so 'lucky'? 

As a representative and advocate for Australia's not-for-profit adult and community education sector, I also ask, 'what can we learn for the future of Australian training and skills from our success in preventing widespread pandemic illness and death?' 

This is an important question, given our severe economic downtown, the now acknowledged recession, high unemployment, and the devastation inflicted on many industries and sectors, including international education, tourism and hospitality. 

I draw two conclusions from this success: the importance of government as a leader and the importance of community action. 
Government action
Government action is obvious. Our state and national leaders got together in a 'national cabinet' and made some sound decisions to shut down social interaction. Just in the nick of time, as it turns out. Governments, especially the commonwealth, are now responsible for a large part of all economic activity in Australia. commonwealth interventions -- notwithstanding a few notable mistakes and miscalculations -- have been timely, targeted, appreciated and supported by all sides of the political spectrum. 

Less obvious is that the 'snap back' concept -- reverting to private enterprise as the primary means of recovery, the way it was before -- won't work, especially so in areas where the commercialisation was already struggling. 

Australian vocational educational and training (VET) is one of these. A couple of decades of 'marketising' Australia's VET sector, so much so that 70% of Australia's 4.1 million VET students enrolled with private for-profit providers in 2018, including 39% of government-funded VET students. (Not-for-profit community providers make up 10% of all VET students and 5.6% of government-funded VET. TAFE has most of the remaining students.) For one of the Australia's greatest public policy debacles, look no further than the ill-fated VET FEE-HELP program, which allowed an unprecedented national rorting of public funds by private training companies -- and a concomitant destruction of the Australian VET brand. 

Add to that lagging funding -- VET is the only educational sector with funding to move backwards in recent years (see image below from the Mitchell Institute) -- and a national system that pushes school-leavers to attend university over VET. And there's the number of providers: around 4000 registered training organisations (RTOs) in Australia. Last year, the commonwealth's expert VET reviewer, Stephen Joyce, wrote of 'a bewildering array' of RTOs, group training organisations and ""state and territory agents queuing up to help ... [with] current and future apprentices and trainees."" Compare those numbers to Australia's simpler university system, where 95% of students attend one of 37 public universities. 

Advocates for Australia's for-profit VET sector propose to make all VET government funding 'contestable', meaning 100% private contracting, based on 'user choice' and cost-efficiency. That unlikely step would not result in quality education fit for Australian post-coronavirus economic challenges. That move would see a dramatic collapse of VET delivery to those who need it most, because it's often hard -- and expensive -- to deliver VET to the most vulnerable and disadvantaged students, including people with disabilities, Indigenous students, students from lower socio-economic status and those living outside major cities. 

Why do we know this? Because our research shows that not-for-profit community (and, secondly, TAFE) providers engage far and away the most -- by a factor of two (200%) or more -- Indigenous, rural and regional, poor and disabled students on a percentage basis, compared to for-profit providers. 

The introduction of 'marketisation' (privatisation) competition into VET was meant to increase quality, responsiveness, efficiency, access and more equitable outcomes. Research by Dr Don Zoellner shows that competition has, on the contrary, particularly disadvantaged regional, rural and remote Australians, as well as disadvantaged learners generally: 'The further students were located from the major city region, the greater was the reduction of access to training rather than the promised benefits of the market,' Dr Zoellner concludes. This occurs despite the greater importance of VET to the economies of regional, rural and remote areas, a result of their business structures and workforce needs. 

As Australia pulls through the current economic crisis, there is only one force that can lead -- governments, national and state, which will need to simultaneously increase VET funding, simplify the VET system, restore the VET brand and work out the best skills for the future along with how to deliver them. They will also need to deal with the large number of Australian adults -- ranging up to 40% of the population -- for whom language, literacy and numeracy (known as 'LLN') -- is imperfect and prevents them from full economic, social and cultural participation. 
Community action
Australia did not survive this crisis just because of government action. Early this year public health experts modelled a potential tremendous break-down of our health system, with a worst-case pandemic scenario of up to 150,000 deaths and 60% of the population infected. It didn't happen, not even close. Why not? 

The modelling didn't overestimate the risk, according to Professor James McCaw: ""Rather, it underestimated society's ability to respond and prevent transmission"". 

The modelling was based on the assumption that ""only fairly modest levels of social restriction to reduce transmission would be achievable in Australia,"" said Professor Jodie McVernon, from the Doherty Institute. The public buy-in of physical distancing, hygiene, isolation and quarantine measures reduced the spread ""beyond initial expectations"". 

The Australian community -- not just a few people, but a large majority of people -- understood. We 'got it'; we responded; we exceeded the expectations of experts. Thank goodness we did. 

That was then, only a few short months ago. But we are also left with a torn economic and social fabric where a complete society and economy once stood. 

Mental health expert Professor Ian Hickie urges us not to fall victim to the hoax of individual resilience: 'Resilience is a social group characteristic.' Jenna Price writes: 'We will need it. Recessions rend the social fabric and we must rebuild. How we can do that is hard to predict but our anxiety will abate only if we take purposeful action, if we act collectively. Bring others along. This is the time to write a new social contract, one where we extend love and honour and decency and respect, the way we behave during our important rituals, to include all those who inhabit the world around us.' 
Lessons for Australian skills and training
What does this mean for Australian skills and training in the post-Coronavirus era? A great deal, as it turns out. 

Given the importance of community in dealing with our health, social, cultural and emotional stresses, one Australian VET sub-sector perfectly fits this moment of need: adult and community education (ACE) providers, not-for-profit community-managed organisations. Almost 400 ACE providers train more than 400,000 Australians each year; they do so with a high degree of personal attention, efficiency and unparalleled commitment to society's most vulnerable and disadvantaged, including Indigenous Australians, people with a disability and older workers. That's an awfully large number and indicates an educational capacity that governments need to utilise as we enter the early phases of a Coronavirus economic recovery. This recovery needs new skills, but a deeply strained VET sector has been unable to operate anywhere near capacity. 

ACE providers have operated in Australia since the early 19th century; some of them -- like the WEAs (Workers Education Associations) in Newcastle, Wollongong, Sydney and Adelaide -- have operated continuously since 1913. That's an enviable track record, outlasting all but a handful of Australian post-secondary institutions. What a shame to waste it. 

NFP community education providers have an important role in rebuilding the Australian social fabric through group resilience: a large number have combined education and training with community mental health programs. 

Now, more than ever before in our lifetimes, we need a partnership between 'government' and 'community' for a much-needed economic and social recovery. Australian adult and community education providers are essential to that mission.

2020-06-16,Opinion: COVID-19 lessons for Australian training and skills,,"Fredericton: The Government of New Brunswick, Canada has issued the following news release:
The following op-ed was issued by Dr. Jennifer Russell, chief medical officer of health:
In recent days, we have received questions looking for specific information about how the latest outbreaks of COVID-19 in Zone 1, the Moncton region, and Zone 5, the Campbellton region, began.
I understand the desire to know what took place, and I also understand that people want to know why we cannot provide more specific information.
As New Brunswick's chief medical officer of health, I have a duty to do my best to protect public health, and I take this responsibility very seriously. In the event of an outbreak, my staff and I do everything in our power to provide people with the information they need to stay safe and minimize possible exposure to the virus.
I also have a duty to ensure that each individuals' privacy is respected. This is a delicate balance but protecting the confidential medical information of every New Brunswicker is always our priority, even in the event of an outbreak.
Over the past week, I have been asked to provide details that, if made public, could inadvertently identify an individual.
We know many people feel there is a stigma associated with having COVID-19, even though it is no one's fault that they have contracted the virus. A virus can be contracted by anyone; that is why it is so important we take every reasonable precaution to protect ourselves. But even with those precautions in place, it is still possible to contract the virus, and no one should be made to feel ashamed if they are sick.
Everyone must continue to feel comfortable contacting Tele-Care 811 or their primary care physician to report any potential symptoms of COVID-19. It is also crucial that anyone who is confirmed to have the virus provides all the relevant information about where they have been and the names of people with whom they have had contact in the days leading up to their positive test.
If people fear that they will be ostracized or vilified in their community, they are much less likely to come forward to get tested. They may also be hesitant to provide key information that can assist with contact tracing and allow us to contain outbreaks quickly.
This creates the potential for more widespread outbreaks, putting the public at greater risk of coming into contact with the virus.
Throughout this pandemic, I have always provided the pertinent information the public needs to take measures to protect themselves. I have been as transparent as possible, while protecting private information.
We are forthcoming when we know there has been a risk of exposure in a public place, such as a grocery store or a restaurant, and will provide details about dates and times when exposure may have taken place, allowing New Brunswickers to take special care to self-monitor for symptoms if applicable.
But naming names or providing identifying information about a person will not help us manage outbreaks. This practice only causes harm to individuals, encourages the public to be less forthcoming and makes outbreaks more difficult to manage.
As the pandemic continues, everyone should be able to feel confident that they will not face stigmatization if they do test positive for COVID-19. We will continue to see more cases of the virus in our province. It could easily impact you, a family member or a close friend.
I will continue to provide the information that is necessary to slow the spread of the virus. New Brunswickers who have potentially been exposed to the virus through interactions with a positive case will continue to be made aware through contact tracing. Any time the potential exposure is in a public space, I will continue to advise the public to ensure we reach everyone who may be impacted.
New Brunswickers have been asked to place a great deal of trust in me and my team this year, and I want everyone to know how much I appreciate this. I will continue to keep the public informed about new confirmed cases, while still protecting every individual's private medical information.
Since March, I have often called on New Brunswickers to be kind and compassionate, and to think about what they can do to help their neighbours. That message has not changed. Let's continue to remember that we all have a role to play, and we are all in this together.","EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (99%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (90%); PRIVACY RIGHTS (90%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH (89%); DISEASE CONTACT TRACING (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); HEALTH CARE INFORMATION (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); MEDICAL RECORDS (77%); PATIENT PRIVACY (77%); PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS (73%); TELEMEDICINE (72%)

2020-10-19,Op-ed / COVID-19 and privacy concerns,,"COVID is finally over. How do I know? I took my mask off.
Not everywhere, but in more places than I have before - in a hotel, while dining indoors; during a packed lecture; picking up The Jerusalem Post from my local Steimatzky bookstore.
Of course, I know that COVID is not really over. People are still getting sick every day. The US is on track to see 150,000 COVID deaths this year. (If current numbers hold, Israel will have just over 1,000 COVID deaths in the coming 12 months.)

But at a certain point, despite the documented dangers, we have to make the switch to ""live with COVID."" Not just in words but in deeds, too.
For many people, that moment came when indoor mask mandates were relaxed. My wife, Jody, and I held on for longer. Our turning point was the fifth vaccine, the Omicron booster, which we got a few weeks ago.
 The COVID-19 vaccine (illustrative). (credit: PIXABAY)
The feeling on that day was: We've done all we can do. This booster probably won't prevent us from getting COVID again (COVID is likely to continue to infect 50% of us every year, according to Trevor Bedford, a virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center), but the cumulative effect is to make the disease less severe.
Besides which, I had a pretty positive experience when I caught COVID in March and a dose of Paxlovid knocked out my mostly mild symptoms in under a week. So, my thinking went, I may be immunocompromised, but I survived it once, I will survive it again.
We're still masking up on public transportation, on planes, in crowded locations. Which leads to an awkward place.
""Mask wearing has been relegated to a sharply shrinking sector of society,"" writes Kathryn Wu in The Atlantic. ""It has become, once again, a peculiar thing to do.""
""Mask wearing has been relegated to a sharply shrinking sector of society. It has become, once again, a peculiar thing to do.""
Katherine Wu
How could it not, when influential figures like Joe Biden declare, as he did on TV's 60 Minutes, that ""The pandemic is over… If you notice, no one's wearing masks.""
But wishful thinking is not epidemiological accuracy. Donald Trump was not some Greek oracle when he proclaimed in 2020, ""One day - it's like a miracle - it will disappear."" No, you can't will COVID out of existence; that's not how viruses work.
And long COVID remains a huge problem.
An alarming study from Maccabi Healthcare Services, one of Israel's largest HMOs, found that 34.6% of participants reported not returning to their baseline health condition some five months since recovering from COVID.
Nevertheless, masking - in America at least - is down to 29% of the population, compared with 50% to 80% in the first two years of the pandemic.
""It [wearing a mask] feels like something that now needs an explanation,"" a friend told Wu. ""It's like showing up in a weird hat, and you have to explain why you're wearing it.""
""It's OK, you can take your mask off here,"" has become an increasingly common refrain, even when it's clearly not OK.
I first encountered it during the height of the pandemic, when I flew to Florida for my vitreoloysis treatment, an experimental laser procedure for eye floaters. The doctor, with whom I was in close physical contact, said just that while not wearing a mask himself (this despite the sign at the front door clearly stating masks must be donned).
I wore my mask during the procedure and didn't get COVID. Yet I felt a strong urge to conform. He was a doctor, after all.
""You can feel when you're the only one doing something,"" immunocompromised physician Meghan McCoy told Wu for her Atlantic article. ""It's noticeable.""
MCCOY NOTED that, typically, ""there's no big sign on our foreheads that says 'This person doesn't have a functioning immune system.'""
Masks now have become exactly that kind of sign.
In our new post-COVID reality, masks draw attention, like a wheelchair, prosthetic device or service dog. They ""invite compassion but also skepticism, condescension and invasive questions,"" Wu writes.
To go mask-free, by contrast, is like ""reverting to a past that was safer, more peaceful,"" Wu notes. ""Discarding masks may feel like jettisoning a bad memory, whereas clinging to them reminds people of an experience they desperately want to leave behind.""
Don't we all want that?
Well, yes… and no.
I'd be lying if I didn't admit it was exhilarating to eat in a restaurant again, to walk around a museum unencumbered by a tightly tied Sonovia cloth.
And yet, this ""new normal"" is also an admission that we've failed.Failed to stop a virus that will now circulate among human beings forever. There are, after all, still DNA remnants of the 1918 flu pandemic in today's annual flu outbreaks. 
Failed to depoliticize science such that mask-wearing, along with vaccines, became not a matter of public safety but one of red vs blue, Right vs Left.
Failed to embrace good governance over populism, vilification and victimization.
The other night, Jody and I went to the Yes Planet in Jerusalem to see Cinema Sabaya, Israel's top Ophir award-winning film this year. We didn't wear our masks - until we heard the man behind us coughing, at which point we donned our cloths in the dark and felt somewhat more secure.
We'll also wear our masks more consistently prior to a big event or vacation so that we don't get sick and miss out.
I wish COVID never came into our lives. Moreover, I wish masking could be a personal choice, free of stigma.
Wu asked her mother, who lives in Taiwan, ""How is masking going in Taipei?""
It is still quite common in public spaces, even where it wasn't mandated, her mother explained.
When Wu asked why, her mother's response was telling.
""Why not?"" 

2022-12-16,Is the COVID-19 pandemic finally over? - opinion,,"Uncertainty over Co-operative Bank's growth prospects has prompted a stocks downgrade amid escalating Covid-19 pandemic and planned purchase of troubled Jamii Bora Bank (JBB).
Analysts at Renaissance Capital (RenCap) have revised their view of the lender's growth prospects downscaling the stock from 'buy' to 'hold' with a target price of Sh13.1 per share compared to earlier projections of Sh21.4 per share.
Monday the bank's stock at the bourse was trading at Sh12.30 at around 12:15pm having dropped by 0.81 percent.
According to the assessment report released last week, the growth prospects for the country's fourth largest bank by assets faces a myriad of impediments, including its proposed acquisition of Jamii Bora, which some analysts believe may not necessarily add value to Co-op's dwindling fortunes.
In November last year Renaissance assumed the lender will not be involved in any activities relating to mergers or acquisition this year, a move which could have preserved its earnings.
According to analysts at AIB Capital, the acquisition of JBB is unlikely to improve Co-op Bank's balance sheet.
'We don't think the acquisition will add much to Co-op's balance sheet,' said AIB Capital.
The turmoil in the financial sector as a result of the Coronavirus is expected to lead to an increase in the volume of non-performing loans (NPLs) and a drop in banking transactions as people stay at home due to measures imposed by the government to deal with the global pandemic.
As a result the bank's interest and non-interest (non-funded) income is expected to come under intense pressure
In November last year (2019), Renaissance had placed Co-op's stock in 'buy' category alongside KCB and Equity bank on grounds that its net interest margin (NIM) will improve by 50-60 basis points per year over the next three years, with credit growth improving to 15-16 per cent in the same period.
The analysts also assumed that the lender's return on equity (ROE) will increase to between 20-25 percent per annum over the next three years and that the lender will not be involved in any merger or acquisition.",,349,Jpost.com (The Jerusalem Post online edition)
2020-04-21,RenCap lowers Co-op outlook on Covid-19 fears,,"Towards the latter part of July, Australia's unimaginative Prime Minister Scott Morrison received a request from the police commissioner from the state of New South Wales. It was a query on whether personnel from the Australian Defence Forces might aid in patrolling eight local government areas in Sydney subject to pandemic restrictions.
The NSW police minister David Elliot explained their function: the soldiers would be aiding the police with ""extra capability when it comes to ensuring compliance"". They would mainly be directed to a ""very active small minority … that think the laws don't apply to them.""
Morrison, in addressing the parameters of the deployment, stated that ADF personnel were ""there to support authorised law enforcement officers in New South Wales"". As in the case of Victoria last year, they would ""support and assist […] doing many tasks from driving vehicles to supporting logistics to assisting communities by checking on the welfare of the people, checking in on people's isolation.""
Writing in the Spectator Australia, Pete Shmigel was unimpressed by the lack of clarity in the deployment, the details of which remain secret. ""Indeed, it's difficult to be clear if the ADF is patrolling with the Police, or providing some forms of logistical support, or acting as welfare officers, or being Uber drivers.""
Cumberland Mayor Steve Christou was similarly put out by the deployment of military muscle, even if it would lack arms or any official powers. In terms of demographics, the Cumberland district he represents was one of the poorest; residents ""already feel picked on and marginalised."" They were unable to ""pay the mortgage, the rent, the food or work. Now to throw the army out to enforce lockdown on the streets is going to be a huge issue with these people."" To make matters worse, many were refugees whose experience with khaki clad personnel would have been rather different to those of many Australians.
Christou has good grounds to be worried. The military can hardly count as pandemic specialists, nor can they be seen as ideal agents of public health control. Certain fields of public endeavour should treat military incursions with the due consideration of a lengthy barge pole. But the formula has been repeated across the globe. The symbolic force and connotations of having military participants is a signal warning to the public that they should behave.
Parts of Sydney are not the only ones exposed to this military flavour. The entire country has since faced a distinctly military flavour in the COVID-19 response. While Adam Kamradt-Scott, an authority on global health, suggests that militaries, with their preparedness for war, have ""extremely good logistics"" otherwise ""lacking in civilian equivalents"", the ADF has historically resisted a public health role.
The presence of military personnel, notably in terms of the vaccination program, is strong. In April, the Morrison government appointed Commodore Eric Young of the Royal Australian Navy as Operations Coordinator from the Vaccine Operations Centre. In making the announcement, Health Minister Greg Hunt recalled the role played during this pandemic crisis by other members of the ADF, including the contribution of Commodore Mark Hill, who was involved in the Aged Care Response Centre in Victoria. He also thanked those ""thousands and thousands of Defence personnel who've assisted with contact tracing, with testing, with vaccination teams that have been out in particular parts of Australia"".
In June, Lieutenant General John Frewen joined the public face of the national COVID-19 response as head of the vaccine taskforce, known bombastically as Operation COVID Shield. ""The National COVID Vaccine Taskforce,"" stated Morrison, ""will help ensure as many Australians are vaccinated as early as possible within the available supply."" In a matter of days, the General began assuming a prominent role that had the effect of displacing the civilians present. In effect, he had assumed the responsibilities previously held by the retiring health associate secretary Caroline Edwards.
The move also served to create confusion in the media pack. When asked by Guardian Australia about what exactly his role was, the response was classically bureaucratic. The health minister's office was the first to be contacted about clarifying this new, nebulous role. Those queries were quickly directed to the Department of Health. The department, in turn, pushed those queries off to the Prime Minister's office, only to have those same queries referred back to the Department of Health.
A curt statement was eventually issued from a spokesperson for COVID Shield, achieving little by way of clarification. ""Lieutenant General Frewen is a senior officer in the Australian Defence Force,"" it began, banally. ""LTGEN Frewen is currently seconded to Operation COVID Shield as Coordinator General and remains an Officer of the Australian Defence Force. More information about this role can be found in the Prime Minister's 4 June 2021 National Cabinet Statement.""
This threadbare response went on to outline that further details on Frewen's responsibilities as coordinator general of the taskforce could be found at a hearing of the Senate Select Committee on COVID-19 on June 21, 2021. Frewen did not give much away before the Senators, though he did tell the committee that his reporting lines were directly to the Prime Minister and the Minister for Health. He also provided briefings to the national cabinet and was to ""engage"" with the relevant secretaries. In terms of influence, he claimed to ""have direct operational control of all relevant assets and resources across the Commonwealth and I'm also responsible for communication with the public and engagement with the states and territories, health providers, and other key stakeholders to ensure the most efficient and effective distribution of the vaccine.""
The meetings came, as did the military brass and photo shoots, prompting remarks that Morrison had simply ""outsourced"" the pandemic response only to hide behind military uniform. Former Labor deputy prime minister Wayne Swayne was all thunder at the spectacle. ""How pathetic it is to see Morrison rollout Generals on TV to camouflage his failure to purchase the quantity and the quality of vaccines urgently required to protect Australia.""
Australia's resort to the military in these pandemic times is unexceptional. When found short in their civilian deployments, the authorities in many countries have called upon the armed forces to provide assistance. But the pressing concern when using such personnel, notably in instances where their roles and positions are unclear, can only trouble the purists of accountability. For Morrison, the move is very much in the tradition of mass distraction and excuse. If more things go wrong, blame the medically inexpert Lieutenant General.","POLICE FORCES (90%); ARMED FORCES (89%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (89%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (89%); EPIDEMICS (89%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (89%); ARMIES (78%); CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONS (78%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (78%); HEADS OF STATE & GOVERNMENT (78%); PRIME MINISTERS (78%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (78%); WAR & CONFLICT (77%); REGULATORY COMPLIANCE (76%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (73%); POOR POPULATION (72%); REFUGEES (72%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (72%); VACCINES (72%)

2021-08-10,Call In The Khaki: The Australian Defence Force And COVID-19 – OpEd,,"The U.S. Air Force's Eglin Air Force Base issued the following news:
Team Eglin added a second complication to the annual hurricane exercise May 6-14, by conducting the event while reviewing COVID-19 protocols and procedures.
The exercise was one of the first held in the Air Force since the corona virus global pandemic began.
Maj. Kelly Mattie, emergency operations center director, said all emergency operations strategies related to the virus were scrutinized.
""We had some good lessons learned after Hurricane Michael, and made several revisions to our hurricane plan,"" Mattie said. ""However, in our first hurricane exercise to test the revisions, we had a real-world COVID-19 contingency mixed in.""
All regulations, instructions, procedures, plans and policies related to COVID-19, as applicable during a hurricane, were thoroughly reviewed during the exercise, according to Tech. Sgt. Jacob Urry, Hurrex director.
""We insured they were all clear, pertinent and adaptable to given scenarios and executed appropriately,"" he said. ""We did it safely, without as much physical interaction as in past exercises.""
Exercise planning was conducted virtually. In one scenario, three nearby states were eliminated as evacuation destinations due to the virus, Urry said. This prompted planning evacuations to secondary locations.
""Participation from base units and tenants was awesome,"" Urry said. ""It helps exercise structure and execution when information sharing and effective communication practices are in place.""
Mattie said limitations caused by the virus to certain contingency and emergency operations were addressed. EOC manning was streamlined, checklists were reviewed and virtual connections were ramped up during the exercise, he added.
This year, deployment of equipment and personnel movement to aircraft evacuation or hurricane relief sites, was simulated.
During the hurricane, equipment and the personnel who move with it, departing and returning to the base, did so according to 96th Medical Group and the Center for Disease Control guidelines, Mattie said. All movements are evaluated in accordance with COVID-19 risk levels.
Processes for sheltering people off-base and care for recovery team personnel who could contract the virus, were reviewed.
Mattie encouraged base personnel to heed all COVID-19 information disseminated by their leadership. As teleworking is now a reality, he encouraged close monitoring of all communication channels and social media platforms during a real hurricane.
""We balanced the real-world COVID-19 situation with the hurricane exercise,"" Mattie said. ""The exercise allowed the 96th Test Wing staff to think deeper about preparing for an actual event. A lot of good lessons came from the exercise and Team Eglin has a strong plan, going forward.""

2020-05-16,Eglin AFB: Eglin Exercises Hurricane Ops Under COVID-19 Guidelines,,"Apr 09, 2020( The Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting: http://investigatemidwest.org Delivered by Newstex) ; News is beginning to trickle out of how the novel coronavirus is impacting our nation's meatpackers and inspection services. And it ain't good.Here's a sample.Dozens of workers walked off the job at Purdue Farm's Kathleen, Georgia facility[1] over concerns that they might have been exposed to COVID-19. Perdue says it's sanitizing all its plant's every 24 hours and encouraging workers to stay home if they are sick or think they might have been exposed to the virus..but not if they are fearful (more on that in a moment).Positive COVID-19 cases[2] have been identified at facilities owned by Sanderson Farms, Smithfield Foods, Purdue Farms even Tyson, who has had a ""limited number of team members test positive.""The Food and Drug Administration on March 18 halted all routine food inspections[3] at facilities that manufacture food in the hopes of flattening the curve of COVID-19 cases.Taken together these facts suggest a food system under duress. Social distancing measures are likely resulting in fewer workers at meat processing plants. 
Those pushing on may be more tired and stressed then usual which may lead to food processing mistakes. And with the suspension of routine food safety inspections there is a greater chance that something falls through the cracks...such as a foodborne illness outbreak.Yeah it's a mess.Some companies have already read the tea leaves. For example, recently Sanderson Farms ordered more than 400 slaughterhouse workers in Georgia to stay home[4], even if they feel healthy. Tyson Foods. Perdue, and Cargill say they've begun company wide temperature checks in the hopes of keeping sick people from infecting the rest of the workforce. But as of this writing such temperature checks are not industry wide and there are over 800 federally inspected livestock slaughter plants in the U.S. There's also close to 4,000 plants that process red meat and almost 3,000 federally inspected poultry slaughter plants.[5]And Pro Publica is reporting[6] many meat packers are ignoring social distancing practices.Meanwhile, over at the FDA, they're downplaying suspension of routine food testing. FDA commissioner Stephen Hahn says 'Another critical factor in taking this action is the confidence we have in our ability to maintain oversight over international manufacturers and imported products using alternative tools and methods. This can include, among other things, evaluating records in lieu of conducting an onsite inspection on an interim basis when travel is not permissible, when appropriate.'And it all that isn't enough consumer demand for food has gone straight through the roof. The National Chicken Council reports meat sales spiked by 77% the week of March 15[7] as buyers sought to stockpile their freezers presumably to cut down on trips to public places where exposure to COVID-19 is greatest.The longer the COVID-19 pandemic drags out, the less sure I become about FDA and for that matter USDA staying on top of and ahead of the curve on potential food contamination and food-borne illness. Is it not possible all those eagle eyed workers, auditors, and federal inspections to miss something significant because the workforce is laser focused on COVID-19?

2020-04-09,Opinion: COVID-19 may one day take toll on food safety,,"Throughout this pandemic I've led the effort to hold government accountable.
I've called out the science deniers on the issue of masks and immunity, pushed back against draconian lockdowns that have no scientifically proven benefit and, most recently, asked some very important questions about the origins of a virus that has killed nearly 3.5 million worldwide.
We don't know whether the pandemic started in a lab in Wuhan or evolved naturally. But we should want to know.
During the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee hearing on May 11, I specifically asked Dr. Anthony Fauci about the funding of controversial ""gain-of-function"" research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology, and the potential link between the COVID-19 outbreak and the lab itself.
For those unfamiliar with gain-of-function research, it essentially means juicing up naturally occurring animal viruses in a lab to make them more infectious among humans.
This practice is nothing new. Scientists in the United States have long known how to mutate animal viruses to infect humans. For years, Dr. Ralph Baric, a virologist in the U.S., has been collaborating with Dr. Shi Zhengli of the Wuhan Institute of Virology, sharing his discoveries about newly created super-viruses.
Dr. Baric and Dr. Shi worked together to insert bat virus spike protein into the backbone of the deadly SARS virus, and then used the manmade super-virus to infect human airway cells. Their work received funding from the National Institutes of Health (NIH).
That sounds like gain-of-function research to anyone with ears to hear.
When faced with this information at the Senate hearing, Dr. Fauci said, ""The NIH has not ever, and does not now, fund 'gain-of-function research' in the Wuhan Institute.""
However, Dr. Fauci has consistently advocated for funding of gain-of-function research, even promoting it in 2011 in a Washington Post opinion piece, and has since flip-flopped on his comments from May 11.
Despite Dr. Fauci's contradictions, there is ample evidence and backing by the scientific community that the NIH and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, under Fauci's direction, funded gain-of-function research at the Wuhan Institute of Virology.
Professor Richard Ebright, laboratory director for the Waksman Institute of Microbiology at Rutgers University, has said the application for the NIH funds does meet the definition of gain-of-function. Ebright also said Baric and Shi's ""work is far outside the bounds of normal biomedical research.""
David Relman, a microbiologist at Stanford University, noted that this type of research was ""highly risky"" and brought the possibility that researchers could have made a virus more dangerous for humans.
MIT biologist Kevin Esvelt also noted that certain research methods used at the Wuhan Institute of Virology ""seemed to meet the definition of gain-of-function research.""
Even outside the scientific community, many have begun to question gain-of-function research, and the origins of COVID-19, in an effort to discern whether anyone was responsible for the pandemic.
As far back as January, Nicholson Baker of New York Magazine began questioning gain-of-function research in the Wuhan Institute of Virology and the possibility that COVID-19 originated in a lab.
Baker described the technique Dr. Baric developed, which ""forces"" mutations by serial passage through cell culture so mutations then appear ""natural."" Baker says, ""Nobody would know if the virus had been fabricated in a laboratory or grown in nature.""
What are the odds of a coronavirus pandemic randomly occurring naturally within miles of a lab that creates a juiced-up coronavirus, and that stores more coronavirus samples than any place in the world?
Government authorities in the U.S., including Dr. Fauci, after unequivocally denying that COVID-19 could have escaped a lab, now conveniently say they are open to the idea of investigating the origins of the virus.
Before they were called out, the original claim that COVID-19 originated in a market in Wuhan was the popular explanation for Dr. Fauci and his friends. But the World Health Organization's initial investigation did not find any animals infected with the coronavirus, meaning there's no proof of animal-to-human transmission at the Wuhan market and other markets nearby.
Dr. Baric, an advocate of gain-of-function research, admits, ""The main problem that the [Wuhan] Institute of Virology has is that the outbreak occurred in close proximity to that Institute."" When asked, ""Can you rule out a laboratory escape?"" Dr. Baric said, ""The answer in this case is probably not.""
Is Dr. Fauci not at all worried that one of these super-viruses could escape a lab or that one of these laboratory viruses actually caused the COVID-19 pandemic?
I certainly am, and as an effort to prevent any laboratory-caused pandemics, I introduced an amendment in the U.S. Senate aimed at banning the NIH and any other U.S. agency from funding gain-of-function research in China. This amendment was adopted by voice vote, ensuring that we no longer will use taxpayer dollars to fund gain-of-function research in China.
The question of whether a pandemic was caused by gain-of-function research in a laboratory should not be one we have to answer.
In light of all of these facts, with over three million people dead and trillions of dollars spent, we still have not fully investigated the origin of COVID-19.
Gain-of-function research and the Wuhan lab should be thoroughly investigated and opened to public scrutiny. We must leave no stone unturned in the search for answers. I will continue to lead the charge in pursuit of the truth.

2021-05-27,Congress Must Pursue Answers About the Origin of COVID-19 | Opinion,,"The health minister tested positive for COVID-19 after meeting with colleagues. Officials implore Germans to stay home for their communities - but often fail to practice what they preach, writes DW's Rosalia Romaniec.
When the news that Health Minister Jens Spahn had tested positive for the coronavirus was made public last week, many in Germany expected that half of Chancellor Angela Merkel's Cabinet would have to isolate as well. In the morning on the day he tested positive, Spahn participated in a meeting of government ministers. There was certainly a vocal exchange - possibly loud at times - and maybe even some laughter. Not everyone present would have worn masks the entire time. And is a meeting like that even safe? It's the federal government, after all.
There is a risk wherever people meet. And these are German leaders who are accompanied by security personnel and government staff to several meetings a day as part of their job governing a country of 83 million people.
Even more concerning is that nobody decided to isolate after hearing of Spahn's positive test - not even as a precautionary measure. In the end, a single minister decided to have herself tested.
On the day Spahn's infection was confirmed, his spokesperson said the health minister had had ""no fever,"" but that ""cold symptoms"" were present. Excuse me? Did Spahn go into the Cabinet meeting with cold symptoms? The reassuring answer came two days later: no - in the meeting, Spahn had just noticed a hoarse throat, but the cold symptoms didn't come until later, which is why he decided to test that very day.
Precaution 'whenever possible'
Merkel did not recommend that all who were present at the meeting be tested - but her spokesperson did clarify the hygiene policies of the chancellery and noted that the meeting had been held in a large open room with modern ventilation. That which is not wrong, is not automatically right, of course. Possible doubts could quickly have been clarified. A government that is urging Germans to follow strict measures could have offered a helpful display of caution.
Perhaps Merkel is tired of the pandemic. The otherwise-disciplined chancellor even allowed herself a small slipup last week. ""Whenever possible,"" Merkel said on her weekly podcast, ""please stay home."" Shortly after, she was spotted shopping in Berlin - though with a mask.
Some people who see the otherwise-admonitory Merkel in line for the register might simply think it's nifty to have caught the chancellor out shopping. Others might decide that the pandemic is not so dangerous, after all, if Merkel thinks shopping is still safe. It's not an easy time for politicians, but they may be underestimating the value of setting an example.
Who's the spreader?
Up until the beginning of summer, the only people wearing masks at the Reichstag, the seat of the German parliament, were the facility's staff and journalists. Politicians walked the halls as if they were immune. For the first months of the pandemic, the Bundestag was its own universe. Masks have only been required in the Bundestag, the lower house of parliament, since October 6.
Which brings us back to Spahn. Last week, he met with several people. From whom he caught the coronavirus could not be traced. It seems odd that Berlin's city-state health officials would say the matter is back under control. For a while, they have not been able to promptly inform people who need to isolate. In fairness, several leading German politicians have self-isolated out of concern for the people around them, including Foreign Minister Heiko Maas, Economy Minister Peter Altmaier and President Frank-Walter Steinmeier.
On Twitter, Spahn told the people whom he had encountered during the period that he hopes they ""stay healthy."" In April, he had offered a bit of foreshadowing when he said: ""We are likely going to have to forgive each other for a lot."" He was so right.

2020-10-27,Germany : Opinion: COVID-19 hits the Cabinet and German leaders shrug,,"This hard-won public health milestone shows how communities hold the keys to ending diseases such as the new coronavirus
Africa has reached a momentous milestone which underlines that the continent can overcome seemingly impossible health challenges such as COVID-19. Today (25 August) an independent body of experts has certified the World Health Organization (WHO) African Region as free of wild polio virus. This is only the second virus in history to be eradicated from the continent since the eradication of smallpox 40 years ago. The achievement-which comes after years of collective effort and determined progress-provides crucial lessons to sustain immunization generally, and to help stop the spread of COVID-19.
Our first lesson during the campaign to eradicate polio was that-even though the polio campaign was set up as a standalone programme-community adoption was greatly increased when polio eradication efforts were made part of a broader package of community health measures. While responding to polio outbreaks, our teams and partners approached the eradication of polio not as a separate issue, but as an integral part of a broader package of preventative community health, which involved, among other interventions, routine immunization. This lesson was reconfirmed during our response to the Ebola outbreak in North Kivu, in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC): communities respond better when responders adopt a comprehensive approach which addresses not only that particular disease outbreak, but also broader health and humanitarian needs. In the case of COVID-19, this means saving lives, while sustaining livelihoods and access to routine health care.
Secondly, communities and local actors hold the key to ending diseases. This is crucial. Local actors understand the concerns and challenges of their own communities and are well placed to respond swiftly, even under the most difficult circumstances. For instance, when an outbreak of polio occurred in the Dadaab refugee camp in Kenya in 2013, a camp in which health care workers had previously been unable to operate due to mistrust and insecurity, the Kenya Red Cross Society was initially the only trusted actor who could start a vaccination programme. Today, seven years later, COVID-19 cases have been reported in the same refugee camp. And as in 2013 during the polio outbreak, well-prepared camp residents, working with trusted local social and health workers, are best placed to help detect COVID-19 and to stop its spread.
The last lesson we learned was that no one is safe until everyone is safe. While we celebrate the end of wild polio in Africa, we should be mindful that there is the risk that the gains are fragile. Wild poliovirus continues to infect children in Pakistan and Afghanistan. We also need high vaccination rates to stop outbreaks of circulating vaccine derived polio which can occur when not enough children receive the oral polio vaccine. The COVID-19 pandemic has disrupted disease surveillance and mass polio vaccination campaigns. Some countries are resuming these activities, but we expect that cases of circulating vaccine derived polio may increase due to the temporary halt in activities.
We call upon Governments and partners to continue supporting immunization programmes, while ensuring all communities have equitable access to vaccines.
In the context of COVID-19, the same applies. We urge stakeholders to ensure that COVID-19 vaccines are available to everyone and that Africa does not end up at the back of the queue. WHO, Gavi, the Vaccine Alliance, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and other partners have launched the COVAX Facility to accelerate the development, production and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines.
Crucially, polio taught us that trust and access are essential to reaching needed immunization thresholds. That is why, once again, when COVID-19 vaccines are available, a key success factor will be working with local volunteers, who are trusted by communities. An evaluation of the IFRC contributions to the 2009 Africa polio outbreak response found that the role of local teams have been crucial because volunteers were able to reach communities that were less accessible to Governments or other agencies. IFRC volunteers were welcomed into homes and played a key role in promoting the need for immunization.
It is our hope that the lessons of the past can be replicated in our current efforts to protect gains in child health and contain COVID-19.

2020-08-25,Opinion - the Eradication of Polio in Africa Holds Lessons On Beating Covid-19 [opinion],,"By Barbara Saitta, Vaccination Medical Advisor, Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) Access Campaign
""Dalla padella alla brace""- out of the frying pan and into the fire - is what we say in Italian when you must choose between two options that both have undesirable outcomes.
As we all face the current COVID-19 global pandemic, our thoughts turn to the health of our families and our own struggles. As we hunker down, we also see how the normal and everyday morphs into something previously unthinkable, as we try to understand and process how a global pandemic impacts our day-to-day work.
As a nurse who has worked in hospitals in both Europe and low- and middle-income countries including the Democratic Republic of Congo, South Sudan, Iraq, and Bangladesh, I am simply terrified by what's happening in health centers in those places as they come under enormous strain from the arrival of people sick with COVID-19.
And yet, as someone who works for Doctors Without Borders/Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF), specifically on immunization in developing countries, I'm more terrified by what's not happening in those same health centers.
In many parts of the world, parents already struggle to get their children the lifesaving vaccinations they need to protect them against deadly diseases such as measles, whooping cough, or diarrheal diseases that claim hundreds of thousands of young lives each year. Due to a global resurgence, there have been ongoing outbreaks of measles in countries like the Democratic Republic of the Congo and Nigeria. In 2018, measles killed more than 140,000 people, mostly children under the age of five.
Measles can be prevented with vaccination, as can numerous other diseases--and hopefully, one day, COVID-19 will be as well--but this requires children having the chance to be vaccinated. And now the COVID-19 crisis is compounding the situation, putting child immunization programs all over the world at serious risk of being suspended or halted. The repercussions on the youngest lives could be devastating.
In late March, the World Health Organization (WHO) issued guidance to help countries protect critical immunization services during the COVID-19 pandemic ""so that ground is not lost in the fight against vaccine-preventable diseases."" The main message of the new guidance is that ""countries should take what steps they can to sustain immunization programs and prevent unnecessary loss of life.""
While the recommendations highlight the importance of appropriate protective measures to avoid transmission of this coronavirus, they also emphasize that if immunizations are disrupted it could put an even greater burden on health systems. By reducing disease spread, preventive vaccinations will not only reduce the need for medical consultations in health facilities, which may be overburdened with patients with COVID-19, but they will also prevent the emergence of new epidemics, which are difficult to manage in contexts of limited medical resources.
In MSF medical programs we have seen situations like this play out before. During humanitarian emergencies or natural disasters, the disruption of immunization services, even for brief periods, can lead to increased numbers of unvaccinated children and raise the probability of outbreak-prone diseases, such as measles or meningitis. Such outbreaks may result in increased illness or death predominantly in infants and other vulnerable groups. So today, we can foresee a ""double burden"" on health systems: The COVID-19 pandemic coupled with outbreaks of vaccine-preventable diseases.
Just last week, my MSF colleagues and I had a strategic discussion on how COVID-19 responses in countries where we work could have worrying effects on children's health, such as suspension of mass vaccination campaigns, halting childhood nutrition programs, and the conversion of maternity wards into COVID-19 wards. Other groups have already made some distressing forecasts.
The Measles and Rubella Initiative, which includes the American Red Cross, US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), UNICEF, and WHO, stated that over 117 million children in 37 countries are at risk of missing out on measles vaccines in the face of COVID-19. They say that measles immunization campaigns have already been delayed in 24 countries, and campaigns planned for later in 2020 may not be implemented in an additional 13 countries.
A recent modeling study tried to give a scale of the beneficial health impact from sustaining routine childhood immunizations in a region like Africa. One scenario looked at a six-month period in 2020 and estimated that continued immunizations could prevent 715,000 deaths in children from the time of vaccination until they are five years old. Measles and whooping cough each made up about one-third of the vaccine-preventable deaths in these estimates.
Vaccines saves lives. And I don't say that because a modeling study told me so, but because I have seen it again and again in the eleven years I have been working in this field.
Of course, all countries must take serious COVID-19 precautions and actions to protect their communities and health workers. It's crucial. Yet at the same time, diseases that can be prevented by vaccination can be just as deadly and should continue to be addressed robustly--children shouldn't have to miss out on being protected. These aren't easy decisions to make, but while maintaining immunization services as much as possible right now might seem like an extra burden, the situation will be even worse if countries have to deal with both COVID-19 and one or more outbreaks of another disease, be it measles, meningitis, cholera, or a whole host of others.
Today is the start of World Immunization Week 2020 (April 24-30), the theme for which is ""#VaccinesWork for All."" In the face of COVID-19, which also affects us all, we must not stop ongoing efforts to ensure that lifesaving vaccines reach all of the youngest and most vulnerable members of our families and communities.","VACCINES (94%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (91%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); MEDICAL CHARITIES (90%); PHYSICIANS & SURGEONS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); RELIEF ORGANIZATIONS (90%); CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS & TEENS (89%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (89%); MEASLES (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (89%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); DEMOCRACIES (78%); FAMILY (78%); INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS & BODIES (78%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (78%); NURSES & NURSING (78%); WHOOPING COUGH (78%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (74%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (73%); RESPIRATORY DISORDERS & INJURIES (73%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (73%); VIRUSES (73%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (58%); NGOs and Civil Society (%); Coronavirus (%); Aid and Assistance (%); International Organizations and Africa (%); Health and Medicine (%); Polio (%)

2020-04-27,A 'Devil's Choice' - Balancing Childhood Immunization With Preparing for COVID-19 [opinion],,"Sri Lanka, Oct. 8 -- Co-authored by Ayushka Nugaliyadda & Sarika Warusavitarana of Citra Social Innovation Lab
Nearly ten months on from the declaration of COVID-19 as a global pandemic, many countries eased restrictions, lockdowns and curfews in an attempt to stimulate their economies and commence the recovery process. Among these countries, Sri Lanka has made notable strides in controlling the spread of the virus thus far. However, moving out of a lockdown is no guarantee that the outbreak is being kept at bay, even while borders remain closed to the extent that they currently are, as demonstrated by recent evidence of the emergence of a new cluster. Until a vaccine is made available, it is vital that Sri Lankans build on the existing progress made in order to keep all communities safe and healthy going forward.
Sri Lanka has so far benefitted from the payoffs of an early lockdown. The country partially lifted its island-wide lockdown in mid-May and completely removed it by the end of June. Since then, we have seen an easing of inter-district travel restrictions, the opening of schools, universities, places of worship, restaurants and bars with safety measures in place, and a relaxing of attitudes towards social distancing guidelines in general. International borders remain closed for the foreseeable future, save for scheduled repatriation flights. Notably, general elections were held in August 2020 with stringent and exemplary precautionary measures in place, which were widely praised as being safe and efficient, despite initial concerns about crowds at polling stations.
In the months following the election, events, concerts, weddings and other large gatherings have taken place with varying degrees of social distancing and COVID-19 precautions observed. While temperature checks and handwashing/sanitization are still largely mandatory prior to entering public spaces, such guidelines were fast becoming simple cursory checks, with less enforcement as time went by with no reports of community spread in the country. This is especially true outside urban areas, where the use of masks and frequent sanitization have not yet been normalised.
In the wake of recent cluster outbreaks and the subsequent curfews issued in those police divisions, it is clear that these next few weeks could prove to be crucial for Sri Lanka's overall COVID-19 trajectory and for the island to maintain or do better than its current recovery rate of 73.4% as at 8 October 2020 (a drop from a previous rate of 93.9% as at 5 October, owing to the recent outbreaks).[1][1] While the rapid response in instituting a lockdown, establishing quarantine centres and contact tracing allowed for the containment of the virus during the previous lockdown period, taking a look at the feasibility of adopting and contextualising additional best practices from other successful countries could be useful in managing and/or preventing a second wave of the virus in Sri Lanka.
Taiwan, for instance, appears to have done very well in managing COVID-19 and avoiding further outbreaks. Its success is a result of a high degree of cooperation and collaboration across government and non-government entities in containing the virus, with quick, decisive decision-making and the use of technology to enable effective contact tracing and quarantine enforcement. Furthermore, it benefited from a high degree of public trust in government institutions and open and transparent communication with the public.[2][2] On the other hand, New Zealand, Iceland and Vietnam serve as examples of countries that were internationally lauded for their largely successful containment strategies and still succumbed to cluster and community outbreaks in the months since reopening. Nevertheless, all three countries combated these outbreaks with strict restrictions and rigorous testing and monitoring,[3][3] and have managed to bring their respective situations under control so as to allow for the easing of restrictions once again.[4][4] A quick review of new strategies employed in some of these countries that Sri Lanka could potentially consider are as follows:
Taiwan New Zealand Iceland
Building on previous experiences managing the 2003 SARS epidemic, the government established a National Health Command Centre (NHCC) that served as the unifying operational command point coordinating between central, regional and local authorities, thereby ensuring unified communication and targeted support. Taiwan also worked to integrate its national health insurance database with its immigration and customs database to allow for big data analysis and rapid contact tracing. New Zealand developed a four-level COVID alert system, with the criteria for each level and the measures to be taken accordingly clearly set out. This information was made available in multiple languages on a central government website. The government also legally required businesses to comply with COVID-19 regulations as public health requirements, with clear guidelines on operating safely at each alert level. The government paired up with a biotechnology company to offer free COVID tests to the public. Iceland also enforced paid leave for all employees that had to quarantine/isolate and decreed that private employees did not have to utilise their sick leave for COVID. Both these measures contributed towards removing barriers in access to tests and to incentivise workers to report symptoms without the fear of losing out on pay.
As we face a potential second wave with community spread, it is crucial that Sri Lanka looks back on the good practices instituted during the first lockdown. Global experiences have demonstrated that short-term mitigation methods will not suffice, as evidenced by occasional outbreaks in even the most prepared countries thus far. Constant vigilance and adherence to precautionary measures, such as the wearing of face masks and continued restrictions on public gatherings, will need to be normalised and enforced. Moreover, these measures should also be enforced uniformly and stringently, so as to ensure mask-wearing and social distancing are in practice in all reaches of the country, and not just within Colombo.
Any containment and mitigation measures taken by the government should be executed with ample transparency, so that communities are accepting of restrictions and to ensure that there is no room for misinformation that could potentially create panic. Unified communication is key to ensuring adherence to regulations. This requires information to be disseminated via a few selected, credible sources in all three languages; the Health Promotion Bureau, for instance, has developed a very user-friendly, trilingual website to disseminate COVID-related information.[5][5] Moreover, to ensure truly inclusive communications, information should also be circulated via visual/video and auditory means to ensure that persons with disabilities are also able to access news, guidelines and regulations. It is also imperative that media outlets adhere to ethical reporting practices, actively protect the security and privacy of potential patients, and avoid the stigmatisation of patients at all costs, which will only be counterproductive by leading to a reduction in people reporting their medical conditions, seeking medical care or adhering to regulations.
It is clear that the economy can ill-afford a second extended lockdown - therefore, Sri Lanka must look back on the good practices instituted during the first lockdown and how we can execute them better. Ensuring business continuity will not only be vital to safeguard livelihoods going forward, but also in minimizing the trade-off between prioritising economic and health safety, such that citizens will not have to make a choice between protecting their livelihoods and protecting themselves from COVID-19; this choice could potentially make a unified citizen-led response to the outbreak less effective, as citizens are more likely to de-prioritise COVID-19 etiquette.
Sri Lankan citizens and the government demonstrated their unified commitment to public health and agility in adapting to new circumstances when the entire country transitioned almost overnight to working remotely during the first lockdown. This agility needs to be supported to ensure the continuity of business while adhering to COVID-19 regulations. As some of us shift back towards remote and more flexible work arrangements, it is clear that we need improved infrastructure and even regulations to allow for a smooth transition and an eventual institutionalising of these practices in ways that would ensure no further disruption (to the extent possible) to education and economic activity. This could include for instance, amendments to existing legislation on work hours and remuneration practices, and the acknowledgement of unpaid care-work in combination with improved systems for childcare.
Sri Lanka still has the potential to capitalise on what is referred to as the 'COVID Dividend' and ensure the country's resilience to a pandemic and any other future shocks. The present resurgence of cases necessitates Sri Lanka taking the opportunity to explore, test and implement long-term solutions that will not only safeguard citizens' health, but also create avenues for the country to regain its development trajectory.

2020-10-08,Opinion: COVID-19 | Where do we go from here?,,"Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, issued the following news release on Jan. 25, 2022:
On Monday, U.S. Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) held a panel discussion with a group of world renowned doctors and medical experts to provide a different perspective on the global pandemic response, the current state of knowledge of early and hospital treatment, vaccine efficacy and safety, what went right, what went wrong, what should be done now, and what needs to be addressed long term.
Sen. Ron Johnson said: ""I'm hoping everybody that viewed this today recognizes the qualifications of the individuals that spoke here today. Now, again, there's disagreement between people in this room. The viewpoints expressed are those of those individuals expressing it. But these are real world experiences from people that are on the front lines, that are treating patients. It's different from probably anything you've heard, unless you've been following these people in the media, trying to break through, trying to convey to the American public and provide the information that I think we all need, that we all deserve. Now, you know, my antenna is always up because I'm getting accused of spreading this misinformation all the time. So I can imagine how the news media is going to treat so much of this. They're going to pick little phrases out, and they're going to pick it apart and they're going to try and marginalize this entire event.
""All I can ask, is the viewers to share this. Tell your friends, I know this is long. This is a five hour long panel, and we didn't even scratch the surface of what we need to discuss. This shouldn't have been necessary. As our information grew, as we became better and better educated, less ignorant about the Coronavirus, COVID, the COVID vaccines, this should have been made public every step along the way. But it wasn't. So again, I'm just asking the viewing public to have an open mind. Respect these individuals who have paid a significant price professionally, reputationally. These are highly qualified individuals. They speak from experience. We've got to fix this problem. We can't let this continue. We can't let it happen in the future. So again, thank all of you for coming. Thank you for being doctors, for being nurses, for being academicians, for being medical researchers, and thank all of you for viewing this. Share this with your friends. God bless you all.""
Sen. Johnson also extended an invitation to the following agencies to hear firsthand from the medical professionals. All declined to participate.

2022-01-26,"Sen. Johnson COVID-19: A 2nd Opinion Panel Garners Over 800,000 Views in 24 Hours",,"We are living in uncertain times. All of us are experiencing the Corona pandemic in various ways. For most it means quarantine and physical isolation. We worry about family members, loss of income and not knowing what the future will look like- or how long this will continue.
While the spread of Covid-19 across Sub-Saharan Africa is a few weeks behindwhat is happening in the US and Europe, the situation in Uganda and other east African countries has begun to shift dramatically in recent days.
A month back there were only a few cases, now the numbers are starting to increase. As a response the Ugandan government has ordered a complete shutdown of the country. International borders are closed, markets and trading no longer allowed, schools have shut, social gatherings banned, transportation has been severely restricted and only essential businesses and personnel are able to continue.
This has significant implications for AWR and all of the women in our programs. At the moment we are temporarily closing down the majority of our operations, except for some targeted agricultural activities to help ensure food security.
We are also redeploying a dedicated group of staff into Covid-19 response.
Many of the women in our programs live in remote and isolated areas. For them the biggest issue will not be fear of the virus but rather access to food. We are especially concerned about older women who are dependent on the income from trade to be able to buy food.
Many of these women care for orphans and other dependents and the risk of hunger and malnutrition for those households is significant.
We are working together closely with local leaders as well as our staff that live in those communities to identify households that are at higher risk of vulnerability.
Our biggest worry is for all the refugees who live in the country. Northern Uganda currently hosts 1.4 million refugees. The cramped living conditions in the camps means that isolation and social distancing are next to impossible.
As of January 31, 2020, the United Nations has received only 9% of total funding needed to care for the refugees, the majority of whom have fled violence in their home countries. That means all services are under-funded.
There is a lack of food, health care, water and sanitation. A Covid-19 outbreakin these settings would be a disaster. Most of the South Sudanese refugees we work together with cannot afford soap. How to even begin talking about prevention when people are unable to wash their hands properly?
We are working together as part of a taskforce with the UN, the Ugandan government and other aid organizations to provide support, both to local communities and within the refugee camps.
Given our long-term presence in and connection to these areas, AWR is in aunique situation for rapid response. Our work in the past has earned the trust of local government and community leaders, and we have a network of mobilizers and local contacts that can help identify and reach the most vulnerable.
So how are we responding and how can you help?
- Security and continued wellbeing of AWR staff- we are committed to paying all staff salaries for the next several months, even if we have to suspend operations. For those who continue to work we will ensure access to personal protective equipment (PPE) and knowledge on how to stay healthy
- Nutritional food support for vulnerable groups- contingent on resources, AWR will mobilize supplemental support for those most in need
- Covid-19 prevention in refugee camps- in collaboration with the taskforce, our team will provide information on how to keep refugee families healthy, identification of symptoms, what to do if someone becomes ill, and how to prevent spreading of the disease. Each household will receive soap.
If we have learned one thing from this, it is the realization that we are all connected and dependent on each other. Now is the time to step up - to show kindness and compassion beyond our own comfort zones.
This is a critical emergency situation and we have the opportunity to help change the outcome. We are counting on you to make that possible. Your donation today is pivotal.

2020-04-07,Women in Africa Most Vulnerable to COVID-19 Pandemic [opinion],,"It is amazing as to why the Security Council has not stepped in. It should have done so as to address the Covid-19 and surrounding scenery in the way it clearly deserves to be dealt with, given its devastating impact on the entire international community on almost every dimension.
By Tan Sri Hasmy Agam and Prof. Anis H. Bajrektarevic*
The COVID-19 situation is very worrying, indeed, alarming matter, not just as a global health and biosafety issue, but potentially as a global security challenge, too.
While the pandemic is being dealt with by the World Health Organisation (WHO), along with other relevant United Nation Specialised Agencies (UN SA), the situation is deteriorating rapidly and could easily get out of control. This of course, if it is not effectively contained. In such a (more and more likely) scenario, it would be engulfing the entire world, whose effects and impact would be akin to that of a Third world war, though initially of a different kind.
We are amazed as to why the Security Council has not stepped in. It should have done so as to address the Covid-19 and surrounding scenery in the way it clearly deserves to be dealt with, given its devastating impact on the entire international community on almost every dimension, including international peace and security, which indisputably falls under its mandate under the UN Charter.
As the Council has often dealt with issues which are sometimes not ostensibly related to international or regional security, and of much less importance or urgency than this dreadful pandemic, we are puzzled, indeed alarmed, as to why it has chosen not to come to grips with the pandemic as a matter of the utmost urgency.
If the members of the Council, for their own internal reasons, have not felt compelled to do so, shouldn't the other members of the world body, individually or collectively as international or regional groupings, such as the European Union (EU), the Non-Aligned Movement (NAM) - G-77, African Union (AU), or ASEAN, take the much-desired initiative to call on the Security Council to imperatively address this global pandemic, even as the WHO and other concerned UN agencies, much to their credit, are dealing with the issue from their own (narrow) perspectives – and yet rather limited mandate and resources.
In this regard, especially the EU, would be well-positioned to exert the much-need pressure on the UNSC, given the devastation that the Virus has wreaked on a number of its members, notably Italy and Spain, among others.
Such an Urgent Meeting, indeed, Emergency Special Session of the UN Security Council at this point in time would be greatly applauded by the entire international community as it would accord the world body the leadership role that its members expect it to play at this most critical point in the post WWII human history.
Gens una sumus. Concordia patria firmat
In this dire situation, the big powers should put aside their ideological and policy differences – as seen in the UN General Assembly case, and focus instead on galvanizing concerted international actions of ensuring the safety, full respect of humanitarian law, and undiscriminated wellbeing of the entire human race.
By decisively and urgently acting, the UN Secretary-General and the UN SC would be sending a bold and clear yet tranquilising signal to the entire humanity. More importantly, such a unison voice would be also welcomed and well understood as a referential (not to say a norm setting) note by other crucial agencies, such as the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (UNHCHR), International Labour Organisation (ILO), International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO), World Tourism Organisation (WTO), as well as by the Red Cross (IFRC), Bretton Woods institutions (synchronised with the UNDP and UNCTAD work), Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), Federation of Trade Unions, Council of Europe (CoE), including other specialised or non-UN FORAs, most notably developmental entities such as the Inter-American Development Bank (IADB), Islamic Development Bank (IsDB), Asian Development Bank (ADB), African Development Bank (AfDB), etc.
In the following period – while witnessing indeed a true historical conjuncture, we need a global observance and protection of human rights and of jobs, for the benefit of economy and overall security. Therefore, the measures imposed these days cannot be disproportionate, unrelated, indefinite, unbalanced and only on societal expenses or democracy recession. Recovery – which from now on are calling for a formidable biosafety, too – will be impossible without social consensus. Clearly, it will be unsustainable if on expenses of labour or done through erosion of basic human rights – embedded in the UN Charter and accepted as essential to the very success of SDGs (Sustainable Development Goals).
Indeed, countries are not just economies, but most of all societies.
(The truth is plain to see: Planet has stopped, although the Capital remains intact. We came to a global halt because the Labour has been sent home. Hence, the recovery comes with labour. Historically, labour has never betrayed, while capital has failed us many times. By the same token, human rights never betrayed the state and its social cohesion, but the states – and much glorified markets – far too many times in history have failed humans. Therefore, there is no true exit from the crisis without strengthening the labour and human rights.)
For a grave planetary problem, our rapidly articulated global accord is badly needed. Therefore, multilateralism – as the most effective planetary tool at our disposal – is not our policy choice. It is the only way for human race to (socio-economically and politically) survive.
Covid-19 is a challenge that comes from the world of biology. Yet, biology and international relations share one basic rule: Comply or die. To remind us; it is not the big that eat the small, rather it is a fast which eats the slow.
It is hight time to switch off the autopilot. Leadership and vision now.

2020-04-05,World On Autopilot: UN Security Council Should Urgently Address COVID-19 – OpEd,,"Pfizer Inc. announced today that the Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use (CHMP) of the European Medicines Agency (EMA) issued a positive opinion recommending the conditional marketing authorization (CMA) of Pfizers PAXLOVID (nirmatrelvir  PF-07321332  tablets and ritonavir tablets) for the treatment of COVID-19 in adults who do not require supplemental oxygen and who are at increased risk for progressing to severe COVID-19.
This expression of confidence in PAXLOVID comes at a critical moment as Europe addresses the ongoing challenges of the pandemic and as infection rates are on the rise in many countries across the globe, said Albert Bourla, Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Pfizer. We are proud to have a strong manufacturing footprint in Europe, which will help support the production of up to 120 million courses of PAXLOVID globally. Pending conditional marketing authorization from the European Commission, we will continue working closely with EU Member State governments to ensure this important treatment can be made available to patients across Europe as quickly as possible.
The CHMP based its positive opinion on the scientific evidence supporting PAXLOVID, including data from the Phase 2/3 EPIC-HR (Evaluation of Protease Inhibition for COVID-19 in High-Risk Patients) trial, which enrolled non-hospitalized adults aged 18 and older with confirmed COVID-19 who are at increased risk of progressing to severe illness. The data showed that PAXLOVID reduced the risk of hospitalization or death by 89% (within three days of symptom onset) and 88% (within five days of symptom onset) compared to placebo, with no deaths observed in the treatment group. Treatment-emergent adverse events were comparable between PAXLOVID (23%) and placebo (24%), most of which were mild in intensity. The data have been submitted to a peer-reviewed publication. Additional Phase 2/3 clinical trials are ongoing in adults at standard risk (i.e., low risk of hospitalization or death) of progressing to severe illness, and in those who have been exposed to the virus through household contacts.
PAXLOVID is currently approved or authorized for emergency use in more than 10 countries across the globe. In December, the CHMP issued advice under Article 5(3) of Regulation 726/2004 to support authorities of European Union (EU) Member States regarding the potential supply and use of PAXLOVID prior to EU conditional marketing authorization.
Our Commitment to Equitable Access
Pfizer is committed to working toward equitable access to PAXLOVID for all people, aiming to deliver safe and effective antiviral therapeutics as soon as possible and at an affordable price. During the pandemic, Pfizer will offer its oral therapy through a tiered pricing approach, pending country authorization or approval, based on the income level of each country to promote equity of access across the globe. High and upper-middle income countries will pay more than lower income countries.
Pfizer continues to invest to support the manufacturing and distribution of PAXLOVID, including exploring potential contract manufacturing options. As a result of these efforts, Pfizer has raised its production projections, with the potential ability to produce up to 120 million courses of treatment by the end of 2022.
The company has entered into agreements with multiple countries and has initiated bilateral outreach to more than 100 countries around the world. Additionally, Pfizer has signed a voluntary license agreement with the Medicines Patent Pool (MPP) for its oral treatment to help expand access, pending country regulatory authorization or approval, in 95 low- and middle-income countries that account for approximately 53% of the worlds population.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); ADULTS (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); DRUG SAFETY REGULATION (89%); EPIDEMICS (89%); EUROPEAN UNION (89%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH (89%); DRUG SAFETY (78%); EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS (78%); MEDICAL TREATMENTS & PROCEDURES (78%); PRICE MANAGEMENT (78%); PRICES (78%); PRODUCT PRICING (78%); RESEARCH REPORTS (73%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (72%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (67%); EXECUTIVES (54%)

The Committee for Medicinal Products for Human Use of the European Medicines Agency issued a positive opinion to recommend the conditional marketing authorization of the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine (also known as BNT162b2), for active immunization to prevent COVID-19 caused by SARS-CoV-2 virus, in individuals 16 years of age and older, US-based biopharmaceutical company Pfizer Inc. (NYSE: PFE) and German biotechnology company BioNTech SE (NASDAQ: BNTX) said.

The purpose of a CMA is to allow for medicinal products to be authorized on a conditional basis for seriously debilitating or life-threatening diseases or for use in emergency situations in response to public health threats recognized either by the World Health Organization or the European Union.

The CHMP advisors based their positive opinion on the scientific evidence supporting the Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine, including data from a Phase 3 clinical study announced last month and published in The New England Journal of Medicine on December 10, 2020. 

The European Commission will review the CHMP recommendation and is expected to make a final decision on the conditional marketing authorization in the near future. If the EC grants the CMA, the decision will be immediately applicable to all 27 EU member states.

To date, the vaccine has been authorized or approved for emergency use in more than 15 countries. Regulatory reviews are underway in several countries, with more submissions anticipated.

The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 Vaccine has not been approved or licensed by the US Food and Drug Administration, but has been authorized for emergency use by FDA under an Emergency Use Authorization to prevent Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) for use in individuals 16 years of age and older.

2020-12-21,"Pfizer, BioNTech Receive CHMP Positive Opinion for their COVID-19 Vaccine",,"Pakyong, May 22 -- Doctors and scientists from across the world are striving hard to find medicine for coronavirus. Currently, over 100 research groups are busy in researches against this deadly virus. Some vaccine companies have also achieved initial lead but they will take at least two years to achieve the final success.
Even if scientists are able to make a vaccine for coronavirus in the next few months, it will take a lot of time to reach 750 crore people of the world. In such a situation, doctors around the world are trying a few already available medicines on COVID-19 patients and some of these drugs have shown results.
In Bangladesh, a team of medical doctors reportedly had ""astounding"" success in treating patients suffering from COVID-19 with two commonly used drugs, Doxycycline and Ivermectin. Dr Tarek Alam from the Bangladesh Medical College Hospital, and one of the senior members of the team, reportedly stated that a combination of the two drugs were administered to 60 patients, all of whom experienced full recoveries within four days.
The patients were stated to have been suffering from respiratory problems, as well as other symptoms of SARS-CoV-2. Dr Alam along with the team is stated to be preparing a scientific paper discussing the effectiveness of the treatment to be published for peer-review.
Dr Alam has reportedly stated that antiprotozoal medicine called Ivermectin in a single dose with Doxycycline, an antibiotic, yielded the near-miraculous result in curing COVID-19 patients. He further stated that his team was prescribing the two medicines only for coronavirus patients, most of them initially reporting with respiratory problems with related complaints, later to be tested COVID-19 positive.
Ivermectin sticks to the parasite present in the body and the parasite is not able to excrete its larvae in the body, and thus is killed by this drug. Even in India, the drug is being used in some states on coronavirus patients and doctors are hopeful that this easily available medicine would prove an effective weapon in the fight against coronavirus.
This is too early to come to a conclusion, but to get answers on why the world is looking at this medicine with great hope, Zee Media spoke to medical experts.
As per health expert ""Ivermectin is a drug that is part of the World Health Organization's deworming programme, and is considered safe in the WHO's Safety List. It is also used as a de-worming tablet and is used to treat coronavirus patients. Many Indian hospitals in Kerala, Uttar Pradesh's Kanpur and Delhi are also trying this medicine on COVID-19 patients.""
According to Health expert, studies conducted at Monash University Australia and the Victorian Infectious Diseases Reference Lab found that Ivermectin eradicated the coronavirus within 48 hours. The study also found that the use of the drug also weakened the RNA of coronavirus by almost 93 per cent. Although the drug was not tried on humans in the study, the same was done by doctors of a private hospital in Bangladesh.
Doctors of a private hospital in Bangladesh gave Ivermectin as well as an antibiotic drug Doxycycline to 60 coronavirus patients and after 72 hours, they found that all the patients were COVID-19 negative, said Dr KK Mishra.
Ivermectin is considered an antimicrobial drug to increase immunity. If it proves effective in the treatment of coronavirus, it would certainly become a miracle drug, but for that a major trial is needed. Above all, the drug has shown a ray of hope to the global medical fraternity in the fight against the deadly virus.

2020-05-22,Covid 19 : Expert opinion on Bangladeshi Doctors claim to cure Covid 19,,"Israel is being celebrated for having administered more coronavirus disease (COVID-19) vaccines per capita than any other country, ahead of the UAE, the UK, Bahrain and even the US. Israel has reportedly inoculated about 20 percent of its population already.
But that is only half the picture. Israel is also the country that is not giving the vaccine to the more than 4.5 million Palestinians who live under its military occupation in the West Bank and the blockaded Gaza Strip. Israel's citizens are being vaccinated, but Palestinians under its gun are not. Tel Aviv is also giving the vaccination to Israeli settlers living on illegally confiscated Palestinian lands in the West Bank.
Protests have been lodged against Israel's separation of these populations, including by the UN, which issued a statement calling on Tel Aviv to ensure swift and equitable access to COVID-19 vaccines, as per its responsibilities under international law.
The issue is also being raised in the US Capitol, where President Joe Biden and members of the US Congress are united in supporting Israel's right to exist. What they are not united on, however, is defending the human rights of those Christians and Muslims who live under Israel's brutal and repressive occupation. In fact, most American politicians and mainstream media outlets are downplaying Israel's less-than-admirable trait of excluding the Palestinians from their vaccination program.
While Biden has vowed to respect the rights of Arab and Muslim Americans and has endorsed the two-state solution as a basis for a final peace accord, he has not said much about Israel's practices. It is still early, of course, and there are a lot of other priorities, such as revoking the previous administration's so-called ""Muslim ban,"" which prohibited travel to the US from several of the world's 50 predominantly Muslim nations.
The Democratic Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has also not addressed the issue. Instead, he is busy pushing the impeachment of Trump. In truth, Schumer has never been very sympathetic to the rights of the Christian and Muslim Palestinians who live under Israel's occupation, and has been strongly supportive of nearly every Israeli move.
But there are some Democratic voices that are standing up and fighting for the Palestinians, urging Israel to provide jabs to those in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A few courageous members of Congress have fearlessly called out Israel's discriminatory policies, including Rep. Marie Newman. She has just started her first term representing Illinois' 3rd Congressional District, which has the country's largest concentration of Palestinian residents, according to a New York Times analysis of US Census data.
Newman wrote on Twitter: ""The Netanyahu administration has a moral and humanitarian obligation to ensure that both Israelis & Palestinians have access to vaccines."" She added: ""Whether we're talking about our own communities, the United States, or nations across the globe, we must do everything in our power to ensure vaccines are not only distributed rapidly but also equitably.""
Other Democratic lawmakers to speak out include newly elected New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman, senior House Rep. Joaquin Castro and former vice presidential candidate Sen. Tim Kaine.
The hypocrisy of Israel being applauded for leading the world in vaccinating its citizens while ignoring the civilians who live under its total control on land it claims belongs to its nation is appalling, but not surprising. Israel is the world leader in rebranding its human rights violations as policies intended to thwart terrorism. It spends hundreds of millions of dollars each year on public relations spin in the US, pays for and hosts hundreds of members of Congress on politically narrow tours of the country, and its supporters write for many major foreign publications, offering a filtered version of reality, while it imposes restrictions on journalists that do criticize Israel.
If the US and the rest of the world are looking for a role model on how to distribute COVID-19 vaccines, they should not use Israel. When it comes to human and civil rights, Israel is at the back of the line.

2021-01-27,Israel No Role Model For COVID-19 Vaccination Rollout – OpEd,,"Aug 04, 2020( The Hindu Business Line: http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/ Delivered by Newstex)  Tobacco Board meet slated for August 5; some want the crop size to be cut, others demand same output As the Tobacco Board is slated to meet on Wednesday, opinion among farmers, who have lost heavily due to Covid-19, is divided on the crop size. While a section of farmers, particularly small ones, want the Board to cut back on output, others expect it to retain the size of 135 million kg for the season.The Tobacco Board regulates the size of the crop in order to control the output, considering the concerns about the ill-effects of the produce.While Karnataka grows it in the kharif season, farmers in Andhra Pradesh grow it in rabi. 
The meeting will discuss and decide the crop size in Andhra Pradesh.The farmers, however, are divided. Some farmers, particularly in Ongole district, want the area to be restricted as they are still unable to sell the produce from last season.Despite the intervention of the State Cooperative Marketing Federation (Markfed), the farmers were able to sell only 60 per cent of the produce (at 138-140 million kg), leaving them in severe losses.But the Federation of All India Farmer Associations (FAIFA) argues that the Board should not reduce the crop size as it could lead to operational problems.The Covid-19 outbreak happened even as tobacco companies and traders were getting ready for procurement over the 18 auction platforms. With the procurement delayed for over two months, the produce was exposed to harsh summer, resulting in dis-colourisation and reduction of moisture — lowering the quality.With auctions set to resume, 'there is a huge pile-up of stocks with the Markfed. Besides, the crop from the neighbouring Karnataka would be out soon. If you continue with the same crop size, there would be glut in the market, making it difficult for us to get a good price,' a small farmer felt.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); AUCTIONS (89%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (89%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (78%); ALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPS (66%); AGRI-BIZ & COMMODITY (%)

Jonathan Watts in The Guardianon saving lives Delay is deadly: what Covid-19 tells us about tackling the climate crisis[3] See related Airlines in crisis: coronavirus bites hard[4] Covid-19: everything you need to know about coronavirus[5] Instant Opinion: Covid-19 shows the 'era of big government is back'[6] 'Like global warming, but in close-up and fast-forward, the Covid-19 outbreak shows how lives are lost or saved depending on a government's propensity to acknowledge risk, act rapidly to contain it, and share the consequences... Instead of deferring risks to future generations, weaker populations and natural systems, governments need to transform risks into responsibilities we all bear. The longer we hesitate, the fewer resources we will have at our disposal, and the more risk we will have to divide.'2. Rachel Sylvester in The Timeson compassion and competence Crisis gives Tories a chance to show they care[7] 'Margaret Thatcher famously said: 'There's no such thing as society. 
There are individual men and women and there are families. And no government can do anything except through people.' Mr Johnson is realising that sometimes people have to be made to do the right thing, and that there is such a thing as the common good. The Tory champions of capitalism, who understood the cost of everything but the value of nothing, have concluded that at a time of global emergency the state may be the only possible safety net... The political Rubik's cube had already been scrambled by Brexit, with the traditional red and blue sides muddled up at the last general election. Now the cube has been entirely dismantled and it is not clear how it will ever be put back together.'3. Charles Moore in The Telegraphon rigid orders Supporters of draconian action must bear in mind its unintended effects[8] 'Last night, Boris Johnson announced a much fiercer clampdown to deal with [thefailure to maintain social distance last weekend]. The public are now extremely restricted in where they can go. His argument is one from dire necessity, and it would be bold to say it is wrong. But those calling for draconian action also need to remember its unintended effects. If, for example, the Government had suddenly 'locked down' London last week - as was rumoured - such a measure would itself have caused chaos. It could have turned hundreds of thousands of people into refugees, overcrowding road and trains, increasing infection risks as it did so... We, the herd, do need guidance, but if we become blindly dependent on rigid orders, we might panic blindly too.' -#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-#8212;-For a weekly round-up of the best articles and columns from the UK and abroad[9], try The Week magazine[10].

David Patrikarakos in The Spectatoron Iran failing its citizens Iran's coronavirus tragedy is depressingly predictable[11] 'The pandemic has hit Iran hard. As of this week there are around 1,800 fatalities, the fourth highest number of COVID-19 deaths after China, Italy and Spain. Iranians I speak to tell me they suspect things are much worse. The government, they say, is lying, like it always does. They are bitter. But their bitterness is tinged with weariness and a weird kind of black humour that is borne of long experience. Times are tough. But then they always are... What do you do when those you are compelled to rely on to keep you safe are those you trust the least?'5. Jamelle Bouie in The New York Timeson the US president's real values Trump thinks he knows better than the doctors about coronavirus[12] 'We aren't quite flying blind, but without more tests we can't see very clearly either. What we do know is that we have a fast-growing caseload that implies that there are many more infections than what's in the official numbers so far. To relax restrictions in this environment is to guarantee greater spread of the disease and higher death tolls... Trump will sacrifice Americans to coronavirus if it will save the market and his prospects for re-election. Which is to say that given the choice between solidarity and barbarism, Trump will choose barbarism. We'll see, in November, if the rest of the country follows suit.'

2020-03-24,Instant Opinion: What Covid-19 tells us about tackling the climate crisis,,"Two northern beaches' mums got into a violent street fight with hair pulling, slapping and kicking after they disagreed about coronavirus isolation on a Chinese internet chat group, Manly Local Court has heard.
But even though both mothers ended up in hospital after the brawl - one had to have a CAT scan after her head smacked against the road - they were let off with a warning on Thursday.
Mengli Jiang, 33, from Brookvale and 36-year-old Jing Liu, from Dee Why, who were sentenced today, both pleaded guilty to one count each of common assault.
The court heard the pair got into an internet argument while posting comments to each other on a WeChat mothers group chatroom about their personal opinions on the coronavirus pandemic.
In a facts sheet tendered to court police said Liu wrote in the chatroom that she did not want ""any more fighting"" and suggested she and Jiang meet to discuss their differences.
But at 8.10pm on January 28, outside Jiang's home in Consul Rd North, the disagreement degenerated into physical violence.
Even though two other mums tried to separate the brawlers after Liu slapped Jiang across the face, they continued to push each other and continually slapped, hit and kicked out at each other. They also grabbed each other's hair before they both crashed to the bitumen.
Both women sustained a number of scratches and bruises. 
Liu suffered a gash to the forehead and a cut under an eye. She had a CAT scan and had to stay in hospital for two days.
Jiang had multiple abrasions on her limbs and had to have her shoulder X-rayed.
Both women sustained a number of scratches and bruises. 
Liu suffered a gash to the forehead and a cut under an eye. She had a CAT scan and had to stay in hospital for two days.
Jiang had multiple abrasions on her limbs and had to have her shoulder X-rayed.
Both woman were originally charged with affray, but that charged was withdrawn.
Liu's barrister Evan James conceded that the discussion in the chatroom ""degenerated to an unacceptable level"", but put it down to community fears and concerns about COVID-19.
Mr James said what he described as a ""scrap"" was not planned or premeditated.
""Neither party anticipated things would kick-off.
""It was never intended to degenerate into what it did. It was an anxious period.
""That is not to say the behaviour was acceptable, but understandable.""
Mr James said both woman had suffered the embarrassment of having the street fight reported around the world.
Magistrate Scott Nash told the women that they should not have resorted to violence to resolve their differences.
""When you engage in physical violence there are consequences,"" Mr Nash said.
""You both had control over this incident.""
Mr Nash said he accepted that the fight was not premeditated but suggested that both woman regretted the incident and would have been embarrassed to end up in court.
He did not convict the women but ordered that they be of good behaviour for two years.

2020-08-27,Mothers who brawled over COVID-19 opinions sentenced in court,,"Manila, May 17 -- The Philippine General Hospital (PGH) would resume full operations of the Covid-19 wards on May 18, three days after a fire hit the third floor of the hospital's central block building.
In a Palace press briefing on Monday, PGH Director Dr. Gerardo Legazpi said he requested Health Undersecretary and treatment czar Leopoldo Vega to give them one more day to clear and prepare the Covid-19 wards on the fifth, sixth and seven floors.
""So, kini-clear up namin iyong mga areas na may amoy pa ng usok bago namin punuin pa ng pasyente. So, itong araw lang na 'to baka makakalipat na ang mga pasyente (we're clearing up the areas that still have smell of smoke before we fill even more patients. So, just for this day, the patients may be able to transfer,) but by tomorrow, we will resume accepting Covid-19 patients to PGH,"" Legazpi said.
He added that the fire that broke out before dawn on Sunday has damaged hospital equipment amounting to PHP30 to PHP50 million particularly inside the operating room sanitization area.
Legazpi said they have already surveyed the market for available units that will replace the damaged equipment.
""Mayroon pong mga available na units na maaari naming mabili, kaya ang amin pong (There are available units that we can purchase, that's why our) strategy is to overcome government procurement procedures. Maybe purchase them on an emergency basis, so that we can equip the hospital again,"" he said.
He said the new equipment will be temporarily installed in two designated areas within the PGH premises while the damaged operating room sanitization area is still under renovation.
Legaspi said at least 34 Covid-19 patients have been evacuated from the fifth, sixth and seventh floors when the fire broke out due to ""faulty electrical wiring or circuit breaker.""
In a separate media forum, Health Undersecretary and Spokesperson Maria Rosario Vergeire said the Department of Health (DOH) has distributed additional N95 and KN95 masks to PGH as the hospital staff are required to wear them for 48 hours to avoid inhaling the smoke.
Citing that fire incidents are high during summer, Vergeire said the DOH has coordinated with the Department of the Interior and Local Government and the Bureau of Fire Protection for the monitoring of DOH hospitals.

2021-05-17,Fire-hit PGH to resume full op of Covid-19 wards May 18,,"Apr 25, 2021( Deutsche Welle World: http://www.dw.de/top-stories/world/s-1429 Delivered by Newstex)  The side effects of the coronavirus pandemic have left an indelible mark on all walks of life. But one group particularly feels lost and left behind, writes Salome Gongadze.I am not the first person to ever sit in a dark room watching a stock market index arrow plunge down. There is something a little different, however, about watching that arrow go down and not be thinking about investments losing money. 
When you're 23 and fresh out of university, the only thing that arrow represents to you is the loss of opportunities.I felt like panicking watching that arrow as it plunged in February 2020. All I knew in that moment was that my prospects of getting a job quickly after graduating with my master's degree just became much, much slimmer. In shaky video chat conversations with my peers, we all related the same fears we had in the pit of our stomachs that we would end up like the last generation who watched the markets crash in 2008. Although we were fairly young when that happened, we all knew the horror stories.Stocks have since recovered, which might comfort some investors. But for those of us searching for jobs post-graduation, the situation still verges on hopelessness.Side effects are a slap in the faceMost people my age recognize that in this pandemic we are fortunate. Being young makes us far less at risk of the health effects of the coronavirus. It seems sometimes that the real troubles this generation now faces are being overlooked because we were spared the health risk.The side effects of the pandemic, particularly its impact on the economy and by extension the hiring of university graduates, have felt like a slap in the face. I write this because those graduating this year and last year had already completed university in a time that felt more precarious than our predecessors.University tuition fees, in countries where they are charged, are the highest they have ever been. On top of that, the cost of living in the major cities where many universities are located, especially for housing, has skyrocketed. I often found it difficult to convey to older people — who often romanticized the student lifestyle — how intensely competitive and stressful life was at many universities, and how much pressure many of my peers felt from employers who always seemed to be raising their standards. That was all on before a global pandemic decimated many industries and often made it impossible to even leave the house. Lost with nowhere to go?This year's graduates are faced with a monstrously competitive hiring market not seen since 2008. Several cohorts of job seekers, both fresh from university and those who have been laid off or had offers rescinded the previous year, are jostling for the same few roles. One friend struggling to find permanent work laid it out to me clearly: she said that doing the work of writing so many job applications while the pandemic raged felt nearly unbearable at times. Job searching is a task that requires high spirits and thick skin in normal circumstances. It's extremely hard to keep this up while experiencing intense social isolation, boredom and a lack of physical activity. At least the class of 2008 could go out for a drink to forget their troubles.For me personally, it is much the same. Time passes rather slowly when the only thing to do is write job applications. Looking at a calendar is very stressful because I notice how much time has passed since I last worked. It's difficult to cope with the fact that it feels that something was taken away from me and others of my generation.Young job seekers need supportYoung people have confessed to growing feelings of hopelessness, and many of us fear becoming a lost generation. Governments should use policy instruments available to them to stimulate the economy and boost youth hiring wherever possible. Employers, too, can play a role. One of the biggest problems of job seeking in this time, one that makes the stressful experience even worse, is how common it is to be treated very poorly. Most job seekers don't expect much in the process, but doing considerate things like sending process updates and prompt rejections can take the edge off and give applicants more certainty.I am very worried that the pandemic is creating a cohort that will struggle for years on end, increasing the problem of intergenerational inequality. The long-tail impact of the earning potential and life prospects of the 2008 generation is well documented. It keeps many of us in the class of 2020 up at night.",,771,Philippines News Agency

Azerbaijan's Foreign Minister Jeyhun Bayramov and the head of World Health Organization (WHO) in Azerbaijan Hande Harmanci have discussed mutual cooperation and the fight against COVID-19 pandemic.
During the meeting, Bayramov stressed that Azerbaijan attaches great importance to cooperation with WHO, highlighting work carried out in Azerbaijan to combat COVID-19 within the country and at the international level.
The minister underlined that the high-level meetings of international organizations, including the Cooperation Council of Turkic-Speaking States, the Non-Aligned Movement, and a special session of the UN General Assembly, dedicated to the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic, have been held at the initiative of the Azerbaijani president.
The minister stressed that Azerbaijan supports equal and fair distribution of vaccines against COVID-19 in the world.
In turn, Harmanci briefed the participants on the projects implemented by the WHO in Azerbaijan, including the activity of training centers in the country's 12 districts, on the services of mobile trainings through the support of the UN Central Emergency Response Fund in the five conflict-affected regions of Azerbaijan. In addition, she provided information on the work with people in need of assistive technologies, strengthening the ambulance system and other activities.
Harmanci announced that the WHO regional director plans to visit the region soon.
Bayramov emphasized the importance of the visits in terms of expanding cooperation noting the great importance attached to the regional director's visit.
Additionally, the minister spoke about the construction and restoration work being carried out in Azerbaijan's liberated territories, saying that WHO and other UN structures can participate in restoration projects.
It should be noted that Azerbaijan has spent AZN 39.3 million ($23.1M) to support international measures to combat the pandemic. This includes AZN 17 million ($9.9M) sent by Azerbaijan to the World Health Organization.
The Azerbaijan WHO Country Office was established in June 2004 in Baku.

2021-06-03,"Azerbaijan , WHO mull co-op, fight against COVID-19 [PHOTO]",,"Apr 17, 2020( City Limits: http://www.citylimits.org Delivered by Newstex) ; Benjamin Kanter/Mayoral Photo Office Mayor de Blasio at J.H.S. 292 in Brooklyn in June, 2018. As the coronavirus pandemic reveals how systemic inequality puts minority groups at risk across the board, disparities in education can't be overlooked. It is evident that high-needs schools in underserved communities are less equipped for a learning disruption than their wealthier counterparts.The schools struggling to adapt to remote learning overlap with neighborhoods bearing the brunt of coronavirus' blow, and a clear picture of the 'haves' and 'have nots' has come into focus.One of the hardest hit neighborhoods in NYC is in the south Bronx, where the confirmed cases are 37 percent[1] greater than the city average. The Upper West Side in Manhattan is starkly different: the confirmed cases are 44 percent[2] less than the city average. These numbers demonstrate how wealthier families are able to work from home and avoid falling ill. 
Many families in poorer districts[3], like those in hard-hit Jackson Heights, Queens and Brownsville, Brooklyn, don't have that luxury. As caretakers in underserved communities continue to leave home for work and contract the virus, students are left to learn remotely without as much supervision and guidance.In a school district on the Upper West Side, 77 percent[4] of students were proficient in English Language Arts by third grade this time last year. In a district in the Bronx, that number is nearly half: only 43 percent[5] of students were testing proficient. Students in low-income neighborhoods already face inequities when it comes to learning because of poor funding, teacher shortages and high teacher turnover rates. Add a public health crisis and a new learning environment that favors the well-resourced. It's easy to see how the opportunity gap is exacerbated.City Hall recently announced $262 million in Department of Education (DOE) budget cuts as a result of coronavirus. $100 million of that will come from the 'fair student funding' formula, which was designed to funnel more money to the highest-need schools. Another $121 million will be cut from professional development spending. This is devastating and a further disadvantage for schools that were struggling before a pandemic. Combined with the concentrated impact of the virus on low-income families, it's crippling.My nonprofit, Teaching Matters[6], typically works to support and train teachers in high-needs school districts. When Mayor de Blasio made the call to close schools, we shifted our model to content creation. We are churning out curriculum for every single day students learn remotely and prioritizing creating materials that are low-tech and viewable on a phone in case students don't have a computer at home. The materials are reaching the children of doctors, nurses, grocery-store employees, along with many other frontline workers who cannot stay home to help their kids with distance learning. CityViews[7] are readers' opinions, not those of City Limits. Add your voice today![8]Whether or not remote learning is extended through the summer, teachers need to be supported and prepared right now. They need to be equipped with all tools necessary to effectively teach students in this unprecedented environment. We made modules and webinars for teachers of English language learners and opened a chat line on our website to field questions.To be sure, Schools Chancellor Richard Carranza's focus has been making the public education system more equitable, and the Department of Education has done excellent work transitioning the nation's largest school district to remote learning. The purchasing and distribution of 300,000[9] laptops to homeless students across the city was an integral step in closing the digital divide. The implementation of a grab-and-go meal system was essential for many kids who rely on school lunches or whose parents are still working and can't provide them. Still, we must not dismiss the stark reality this pandemic revealed.Coronavirus is shining a bright light on the stark inequalities that plagued all avenues of society well before the pandemic overtook our city. As the disadvantages of remote learning in low-income areas continue to compound with high rates of confirmed Covid-19 cases, we must look at how our city has been structured to benefit some students and their families over others.Let's use this as an opportunity to prioritize education and resist budget cuts that will greatly impact our city's most vulnerable children.Lynette Guastaferro is the CEO of Teaching Matters, a nonprofit that increases teacher effectiveness to improve student success.

2020-04-17,"Opinion: Amid the COVID-19 Crisis, School Budget Cuts are the Wrong Medicine",,"Aug 31, 2020( City Limits: http://www.citylimits.org Delivered by Newstex) ;; 'The grand jury—which one former jurist said would indict a ham sandwich—has long outlived its usefulness and instead acts as the prosecutor's puppet. It is well past time for it to be relegated to the trash heap of history.'Jeffrey W[1] New York's former Chief Judge Sol Wachtler 35 years ago observed that district attorneys hold so much sway over grand juries that they could get them to 'indict a ham sandwich.' When the COVID-19 pandemic hit New York, one of Gov. Cuomo's first initiatives was to suspend many of the precious few statutory rights afforded to people accused of crimes. 
On March 20, as part of a sweeping suspension of the Criminal Procedure Law, the governor shelved Article 180, eliminating the protection against prolonged pre-trial incarceration on mere hearsay allegations. Before the pandemic, to keep a person incarcerated pre-trial, prosecutors in New York City relied on rubber stamp grand juries—they would present evidence in a secretive proceeding outside the presence of a judge, the accused, their counsel, or the public. Thanks to the governor's action, people—almost exclusively people of color—were jailed at Rikers Island for months without even this minimal and superficial review of the nature of the charges against them. After allowing people to languish in jail for months, something finally gave way. The governor adjusted the suspension to Article 180 and paved the way for preliminary hearings to commence while grand juries were on hold due to COVID-19. At a preliminary hearing, the prosecution has the burden of demonstrating reasonable cause to believe the accused person committed a felony based on live, non-hearsay testimony that is subject to cross-examination and is given in open (virtual) court.Courts across the city began scheduling preliminary hearings to determine if there was a basis to continue pre-trial incarceration. Almost overnight, police officers had to testify under oath and were subjected to cross-examination about what they did and why they did it. As a result, weaknesses in some cases were exposed and some people were released from jail after a judicial finding that the prosecution had failed to meet its burden of proof.It is critical to bear in mind that during this time, the Office of Court Administration had shut down the grand jury due to concerns with assembling many people in one room for weeks at a time in the midst of a global pandemic.But earlier this month, New York Chief Judge Janet DiFiore heralded the return of the Grand Jury as if it were a feather in the court system's cap. Court administration announced with apparent pride that 8,000 people were to be summoned in the hopes of empaneling people for grand juries to sit in New York City's antiquated, windowless and poorly ventilated courts. Now prosecutors could revert to their old ways and skip preliminary hearings and continue a person's pre-trial incarceration by availing themselves of the grand jury process. CityViews[2] are readers' opinions, not those of City Limits. Add your voice today![3] And while those called to court for grand jury service will be rightfully worried about their health and welfare as they travel back and forth to court and sit in a room with upwards of twenty people for hours at a time, the resurrection of the grand jury is ill-advised for other reasons too: The grand jury has long outlived its usefulness and instead acts as the prosecutor's puppet. It is well past time for it to be relegated to the trash heap of history.New York's former Chief Judge Sol Wachtler 35 years ago proposed abolishing the grand jury system of bringing indictments. Wachtler famously observed that district attorneys hold so much sway over grand juries that they could get them to 'indict a ham sandwich,' and that grand juries 'operate more often as the prosecutor's pawn than the citizen's shield.' The origins of the grand jury as a means of instituting criminal proceedings are from 12th century England. Yet, England abandoned the grand jury over 80 years ago. Indeed, only a handful of countries still use grand juries. The United States Supreme Court ruled over 130 years ago that states were not required to use grand juries; instead, states could authorize felony prosecutions via a preliminary hearing. While old habits die hard, the ways the grand jury became an instrument of governmental efficiency and prosecutorial power, hastily and dutifully marching to the prosecutor's beat, began to lead to calls for reform if not abolition. Federal judge William J. Campbell, former chair of education and training for the Federal Judicial Center, wrote almost 50 years ago that 'the grand jury is the total captive of the prosecutor who, if he is candid, will concede that he can indict anybody, at any time, for almost anything, before any grand jury.' Supreme Court Justice William Douglas in 1973 echoed similar sentiments: 'It is indeed common knowledge that the grand jury, having been conceived as a bulwark between the citizen and the government, is now a tool of the executive.' Although nominally intended to protect those accused of crime, the grand jury's willingness to do the prosecutor's bidding has become undeniable. One study found that federal prosecutors had close to a 100 percent 'success' rate [4]in obtaining indictments when they wanted the accused to be charged.Prosecutors also exert their power over the grand jury when it seems clear they are not seeking an indictment. Prime examples include the failure of the grand jury to indict Police Officer Daniel Pantaleo in Staten Island for killing Eric Garner or Police Officer Darren Wilson in Ferguson, Mo., for killing Michael Brown. While grand juries typically rubber stamp the prosecutor's request for an indictment, in each of the few cases of police shootings that former Ferguson County DA Robert McCullough reluctantly brought to the grand jury, not a single one resulted in an indictment. There are myriad reasons to condemn the grand jury system. Grand juries operate in secrecy—no judge presides over the prosecutor's presentation of the evidence, and neither the accused, their counsel, nor the public are permitted to attend. Furthermore, the prosecutor in the grand jury is not bound by evidentiary and constitutional restrictions. It is no surprise that critics refer to the grand jury as an anachronism, a tool of government oppression, and a modern-day Star Chamber.While the criminal court was in pandemic shut-down mode, it eventually turned to preliminary hearings where police officers testified under oath and were subject to cross-examination. Although not a panacea for all that ails the court, in these proceedings, unlike the secret grand jury, the accused was able to see and hear directly from the police witness. Preliminary hearings also put police officers on notice that their actions will be subject to public and judicial scrutiny and raise the possibility that corruption might be identified sooner rather than later.There is a long overdue national recognition that the criminal legal system is a bastion of racism. The grand jury is a relic of that system. Resort to a grand jury is optional in many states and some have, finally, abolished grand juries entirely. New York should follow suit.Dan Curbelo Zeidman is a Public Defender in New York City. The post Opinion: COVID-19 Showed us Life Without Grand Juries.

2020-08-31,Opinion: COVID-19 Showed us Life Without Grand Juries. It Was an Improvement.,,"WASHINGTON, May 5 -- The U.S. Department of Defense issued the following news release:
The JOC provides key leaders in the state with a constant flow of information and updates they require to make decisions.
""We are essentially a liaison office between the Office of Emergency Management and the rest of the New Jersey National Guard,"" Army Spc. Benjamin Castria, a full-time JOC team member, said. ""We also receive requests from the National Guard Bureau down in Washington, D.C., asking for updates on what we're doing to support the COVID-19 response efforts.""
According to Castria, the JOC also receives requests from the New Jersey State Police and the New Jersey Department of Health, through the New Jersey Regional Operations and Intelligence Center, the steady-state nerve center that serves as New Jersey's primary focal point for information sharing and intelligence production needed to support law enforcement, counter-terrorism and homeland security missions.
While JOC team members normally operate out of the Homeland Security Center of Excellence in Lawrenceville, New Jersey, they had to get creative with the outbreak of COVID-19. To keep the mission going, the New Jersey National Guard JOC became the first JOC in the country to shift to 100% telework capabilities.
""For the first week, we operated the JOC remotely,"" Army Master Sgt. Rene Sales, the noncommissioned officer in charge of the JOC, said. ""It offered a unique set of challenges, but we made the mission happen, and kept everyone healthy.""
Even though staff members have returned, JOC personnel are spread out around the building in accordance with established social distancing protocol.
Logistics experts, active duty liaison officers, medical officers, and intelligence analysts make up some of the JOC workforce.
""The joint effort has definitely been a beneficial and instrumental part of this operation,"" Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Timothy Jardinico, the officer in charge of the joint directorate of intelligence and security, said. ""We get to see it from different perspectives, from all levels of the organization.""
Air Force Master Sgt. Kimberly Kaminski, a security forces airman with the New Jersey Air National Guard's 108th Wing, has been acting as a liaison between the state's two Wings and the JOC.
""It's a whole different view,"" Kaminski said. ""To do missions like this means a lot to me. Humanitarian missions like this are a big part of why I enlisted. My family was affected by hurricanes Floyd and Irene, and the National Guard came out and helped us, so it feels good to be able to give back.""
Air Force Col. Mike Smith, deputy Title 10 commander, who is assigned to U.S. Northern Command, said it was his team's role to support the dual-status commander, Air Force Brig. Gen. Wayne McCaughey, and the deployed forces throughout the state, including Army reserve soldiers with Urban Augmentation Medical Task Force 352-2. McGaughey is the director of the New Jersey Guard's joint staff.
""The Urban Augmentation Medical Task Force soldiers come from all over the country,"" Smith said. ""Wisconsin, Florida, California and many others, coming together for the first time to work together supporting New Jersey.""
""The folks that make the most impact are the doctors and nurses, and our active duty and reserve staff that are augmenting hospitals,"" Coast Guard Cmdr. Shana Donaldson, a member of the U.S. Northern Command Team, said. ""We've got Title 10 medical providers all over the state doing just amazing things.""
Even though they aren't on the front lines of the COVID-19 response, JOC service members recognize the key role they play.
""What our team does is very important and a big responsibility,"" Castria said, ""What we're doing here has a direct impact on what they're doing in the field. Being able to relay information correctly and accurately and quickly is critical to the mission.""

2020-05-05,"NEW JERSEY GUARD, ACTIVE-DUTY TROOPS SET UP COVID-19 OPS CENTER",,"Manila, Sept. 19 -- Joint Task Force Covid Shield commander Lt. Gen. Guillermo Eleazar on Saturday lauded Tagaytay City for being a good model in managing the entry and movement of tourists to ensure that both local residents and visitors are protected from the coronavirus disease (Covid-19) infection.
""The JTF Covid Shield and the Office of Mayor Agnes Tolentino are now working together to turn Tagaytay City as a pilot or model area for all the LGUs that are planning to also open their borders in order to boost local tourism,"" Eleazar said during his visit to the popular weekend destination.
Eleazar's visit aims to make sure that the travel and other quarantine protocols that would be implemented are aligned with the guidelines of the National Task Force on Covid-19 while giving local government units (LGUs) the discretion to find ways to reboot their respective economy amid the adverse economic impact brought by the coronavirus pandemic.
Eleazar said the reopening of Tagaytay City means that people from any part of the country can now visit the area without any travel authority, except for those who live in areas under the general community quarantine (GCQ) or stricter community quarantine status.
Meanwhile, Tolentino welcomed the visit of Eleazar and said the presence of the JTF Covid Shield commander and other ranking Philippine National Police officials.
""We assure the national government through the NTF on Covid-19 that we will be in constant coordination with the JTF Covid Shield to make sure that everything will always be in place in ensuring the proper balance between the need to revive our economy and the health safety of both our visitors and the people of Tagaytay City,"" she added.
Tolentino said among the health safety protocols that they would strictly implement is the wearing of both face mask and face shield and the observance of the physical distancing.
To date, Metro Manila, Batangas, Bulacan, and Tacloban City are under the general community quarantine while Iligan City, Bacolod City, and the province of Lanao del Sur are under modified enhanced community quarantine until September 30.

2020-09-19,Tagaytay 'good model' for tourism ops amid Covid-19: JTF,,"Many people are living in fear. Others are panicky because of the scare-provoking coronavirus that is spreading like wild fire across the world.
To put it bluntly, we are in the midst of a worldwide pandemic, with cities and even entire countries shut down. Some countries have already been affected widely by coronavirus and recording unprecedented fatalities while others are preparing to combat what may come.
In Ghana, the panic button was triggered at the weekend when the Ghana Health Service announced that the confirmed cases of the coronavirus have jumped from 16 to 19 or is it 21?
Before then, there were speculations that the country was going into lockdown because of the rise in the number of confirmed cases and that triggered some panic buying in Accra.
Some markets and shops suddenly saw many people buying stuff because of the expected announcement of a lockdown. Fortunately that speculation was dispelled before the President addressed the nation to announce further measures against the dreaded disease.
But the fear and panic among the citizenry is clear for everyone to see, particularly as we all watch the headlines and wonder, ""What is going to happen next?""
As a matter of fact, the coronavirus, or COVID-19, is inciting panic mainly for a number of reasons. It is a new virus, meaning no one has immunity, and there is no vaccine. Its novelty means that scientists are not sure yet how it behaves. They have little history about it and the World Health Organisation (WHO) has already labelled the virus as a pandemic.
The global reach of the virus has led countries into taking measures that are unprecedented in recent history: schools are closing, borders; land, sea, air are being closed, sports teams are not playing games, entertainment and large gatherings have been postponed and banned in some instances.
Although these preventive actions are for good reason, they can also partly explain why people are getting worried and unnerved.
The daily reports of recorded deaths and the fact that the health workers and hospitals in the most affected countries are overwhelmed stoke fears, and make people more worried than we need be about contracting the virus.
But health experts are assuring everyone that there is no need to panic or fear. And argue that there are important, very basic things that people could do to stay safe and even if they contract the virus, can recover.
Those include self-isolating and monitoring your temperature if you get sick; washing your hands regularly with soap under running water; and staying away from large gatherings like churches or market places.
These are some of the things that the health experts recommend that we do to reassert a sense of control over our fears, without overreacting and risking contributing to public panic and anxiety.
Above all, health experts say it is crucial not to let panic take over our decision-making and rational thought processes. Otherwise, the price to pay could be much greater than the threat the virus poses.","VIRUSES (94%); CORONAVIRUSES (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); DISEASE REPORTING (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS & BODIES (78%); PANIC BUYING (78%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (78%); DEATH & DYING (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (77%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (75%); SCHOOL CLOSINGS (73%); VACCINES (73%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (70%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (70%); SPORTS & RECREATION (62%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (50%); Ghana (%); Coronavirus (%)

2020-03-23,Let Not Fear and Panic Determine the Fight Against COVID -19 [opinion],,"Mayor Noel Rosal on Friday welcomed the move of the Land Transportation and Franchising and Regulatory Board (LTFRB) to suspend the Manila-Bicol routes of provincial buses.
Rosal, in a phone interview, said he agreed with other local government units asking the LTFRB to temporarily ban provincial bus operation to prevent the spread of the coronavirus disease (Covid-19).
Rosal, currently the Regional Development Council (RDC) chair, said the issue would be taken up during the regular council meeting on Sept. 4 for possible discussion and to arrive at a resolution.
Admitting that he was not informed of the plan, Rosal said: This is a welcome development, though the move was not meant to discriminate our kababayans (countrymen) who wanted to return home because of the pandemic, rather it aimed to promote the general welfare of the community in addressing the health concern.
Asked how long the provincial bus ban will be, he said: Maybe later when the condition normalizes, to flatten the curve there should be fewer movements.

2020-08-24,Philippines : Bus ops suspended to curb Covid-19 spread: mayor,,"Tokyo, Jan. 3 -- The Japanese government is expected to convene a panel of infectious disease and other experts next week to discuss the possibility of introducing a state of emergency in Tokyo and three neighboring prefectures amid a surge in COVID-19 cases, the Kyodo news agency reported on Sunday.
According to the media outlet, citing officials, the panel's focus will likely center around the duration of the possible state of emergency and which areas should be put under the new restrictions.
On Saturday, the governors of Tokyo, Kanagawa, Saitama and Chiba asked the government to declare the state of emergency, as measures taken so far have not yielded positive results and the number of COVID-19 cases continued to grow.
Earlier in the day, Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga held a meeting with Economic Revitalization Minister Yasutoshi Nishimura and other senior officials, who briefed Suga about the current situation in the country.
Japan has so far registered almost 246,000 COVID-19 cases and more than 3,600 fatalities.

2021-01-03,Japanese government to ask for expert opinion on declaring COVID-19 emergency - Reports,,"Washington: U.S National Guard has issued the following news release:
The New Jersey National Guard teamed with active-duty Air Force and Coast Guard members and U.S Northern Command civilians to form a joint operations center coordinating nearly 700 members of the Guard responding to the COVID-19 pandemic.
The JOC provides key leaders in the state with a constant flow of information to make decisions.
“We are essentially a liaison office between the Office of Emergency Management and the rest of the New Jersey National Guard,” said Army Spc. Benjamin Castria, a full-time JOC member. “We also receive requests from the National Guard Bureau down in Washington, D.C , asking for updates on what we're doing to support the COVID-19 response efforts.”
The JOC also receives requests from the New Jersey State Police and the New Jersey Department of Health, through the New Jersey Regional Operations and Intelligence Center, New Jersey's focal point for information-sharing to support law enforcement, counterterrorism and homeland security missions.
While JOC members normally operate out of the Homeland Security Center of Excellence in Lawrenceville, they had to get creative with the outbreak of COVID-19. To keep the mission going, the New Jersey National Guard JOC became the first JOC in the country to shift to 100% telework capabilities.
“For the first week, we operated the JOC remotely,” said Army Master Sgt. Rene Sales, the noncommissioned officer in charge of the JOC. “It offered a unique set of challenges, but we made the mission happen and kept everyone healthy.”
Even though staff members have returned, JOC personnel maintain social distancing by spreading out around the building.
Logistics experts, active duty liaison officers, medical officers, and intelligence analysts make up some of the JOC workforce.
“The joint effort has definitely been a beneficial and instrumental part of this operation,” said Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Timothy Jardinico, the officer in charge of the joint directorate of intelligence and security. “We get to see it from different perspectives, from all levels of the organization.”
Air Force Master Sgt. Kimberly Kaminski, a security forces Airman with the New Jersey Air National Guard's 108th Wing, has been acting as a liaison between the state's two Wings and the JOC.
“It's a whole different view,” Kaminski said. “To do missions like this means a lot to me. Humanitarian missions like this are a big part of why I enlisted. My family was affected by hurricanes Floyd and Irene, and the National Guard came out and helped us, so it feels good to be able to give back.”
Air Force Col. Mike Smith, deputy Title 10 commander assigned to U.S Northern Command, said his team supports the dual-status commander, Air Force Brig. Gen. Wayne McCaughey, and the deployed forces throughout the state, including Army Reserve Soldiers with Urban Augmentation Medical Task Force 352-2. McGaughey is the director of the New Jersey Guard's joint staff.
“The Urban Augmentation Medical Task Force Soldiers come from all over the country,” Smith said. “Wisconsin, Florida, California and many others, coming together for the first time to work together supporting New Jersey.”
“The folks that make the most impact are the doctors and nurses and our active duty and reserve staff that are augmenting hospitals,” said Coast Guard Cmdr. Shana Donaldson, a member of the U.S Northern Command team. “We've got Title 10 medical providers all over the state doing just amazing things.”
Even though they aren't on the front lines of the COVID-19 response, JOC service members recognize the key role they play.
“What our team does is very important and a big responsibility,” Castria said. “What we're doing here has a direct impact on what they're doing in the field. Being able to relay information correctly and accurately and quickly is critical to the mission.”","COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); ARMED FORCES (90%); ARMIES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); AIR FORCES (89%); ALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPS (89%); NATIONAL SECURITY (89%); US ARMY (79%); BUSINESS OPERATIONS (77%); EPIDEMICS (77%); HUMANITARIAN AID (77%); PANDEMICS (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH (77%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (77%); TELECOMMUTING (77%); INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (76%); NEGATIVE NEWS (76%); DISASTER & EMERGENCY AGENCIES (75%); NATURAL DISASTERS (75%); SAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (75%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (74%); CRIME, LAW ENFORCEMENT & CORRECTIONS (73%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (72%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (72%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (70%); WEATHER (70%); LAW ENFORCEMENT (68%); POLICE FORCES (68%); COUNTERTERRORISM (67%); TERRORISM (67%); TERRORISM & COUNTERTERRORISM (67%)
