Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi reiterated Beijing's opposition to ""vaccine nationalism"", and its commitment to making its COVID-19 vaccines a global public good in his afternoon news conference on Sunday.
He called on ""all capable countries"" to ""try their best to provide vaccines for those in need, make them affordable, accessible to people of all countries"", and turn them into true ""people's vaccines"".
China, on its part, has provided and is providing vaccine aid free of charge to 69 developing countries in urgent need, while also exporting vaccines to 43 countries.
Wang's call for vaccine cooperation was general and in principle with no mention of specific partners. But besides China, the United States stands out among all other countries as being capable of producing and providing COVID-19 vaccines. Despite the differences between them, China and the US have every reason to work together and demonstrate leadership when the world needs it the most.
In spite of the Joe Biden administration's Interim National Security Guidance singling out China as the greatest potential threat to US national interests, the administration has simultaneously underlined the need and its willingness to collaborate with China on issues of mutual interest, which should include addressing the common public health threat.
COVID-19 is a clear and present danger to both countries and the broader international community. The urgency of the matter makes it a natural starting point for China and the US to reengage.
A recent paper co-authored and submitted to the 2021 Hong Kong Forum on US-China Relations by the director and associate director of Brookings' John L. Thornton China Center, on March 2, offered ""Ten Reasons the US and China Should Cooperate Now to Stop the Pandemic"".
The paper argued that cooperation between the world's largest developing and developed nations will boost global synergy, data sharing, vaccine research and development, and equitable vaccine distribution, and facilitate the making of safety rules for international travel.
It also pointed out a significant additional benefit of bilateral cooperation — creating a constructive atmosphere for China-US collaboration in other areas such as climate change.
The two sides' mutual perceptions have changed drastically over the past few years, and they are keenly aware of the competitive aspect of their relationship, but both are equally conscious of the undesirable outcomes if they categorically rule out cooperation. They now need to demonstrate reason and pragmatism.",VACCINES (95%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (90%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (79%); EMERGING MARKETS (79%); ANTI-VACCINE MOVEMENT (78%); CLIMATOLOGY (78%); MEDICAL RESEARCH (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); POLITICAL & SOCIAL IDEOLOGIES (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); SAFETY (77%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (77%); PRESS CONFERENCES (73%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (72%); NATIONAL SECURITY (72%); SAFETY REGULATION & POLICY (70%); PUBLIC HEALTH (67%); CLIMATE CHANGE (63%)

China's marine economy is accelerating the pace of its recovery and is expected to embrace high-quality development thanks to effective measures to prevent and control the COVID-19 pandemic, a blue book said recently.
The economic importance of China's marine sectors will continue to grow this year and through to the end of the 14th Five-Year Plan (2021-25) period, with domestic consumption booming and the international market increasingly dependent on Chinese products, said the Blue Book of China's Marine Economy (2021), which was released in Qingdao, Shandong province, on Sunday.
The sectors' economic output value decreased slightly last year but showed signs of recovery. The book said China's marine GDP reached more than 8 trillion yuan ($1.24 trillion) last year, dropping 5.3 percent year-on-year.
However, market players in the marine sectors accelerated industrial reconstruction and quickly narrowed declines in revenues and profits with the help of favorable government policies.
The blue book was compiled by Ocean University of China, which is based in Qingdao, and the National Marine Data and Information Service, a government-funded public institution based in Tianjin that is responsible for the management of national marine data and information resources.
Wang Dianchang, former director of the policy, laws and regulation department of the State Oceanic Administration before it was merged into the newly created Ministry of Natural Resources in a government reshuffle in 2018, said China should establish a new pattern for high-quality development of the marine economy, and major coastal cities should play a big part.
Bay areas, like the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area, should undertake more tasks to improve their industrial structures and reduce repetitive construction and blind competition, Wang said at the blue book's launch ceremony.
He also mentioned the marine aquaculture sector, saying that the development of marine ranches represents a high-end trend for the sector.
The blue book said the marine economy will ride waves of scientific and technological innovation and make breakthroughs in more key technologies.
Marine engineering equipment manufacturing is expected to see greater application of Chinese-developed technology. For example, 5G technology will help new types of marine equipment, such as unmanned ships and remotely operated vehicles, enter the fast lane of development, the blue book said.
""The blue book features a comprehensive demonstration of China's efforts and achievements in promoting high-quality development of the marine economy, as well as its contribution to addressing global climate change,"" said Zhao Xin, director of the blue book's editorial board and dean of School of Economics at Ocean University of China.",OCEAN ECONOMY (91%); BLUE ECONOMY (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (89%); QUALITY CONTROL (89%); SHIPBUILDING (84%); BUSINESS NEWS (78%); GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (78%); NATURAL RESOURCES (78%); OUTPUT & DEMAND (78%); MARINE AQUACULTURE (77%); OCEANOGRAPHIC & ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES (77%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (76%); PUBLIC POLICY (76%); AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES MARKETS (74%); COMPANY PROFITS (73%); CONSUMPTION (73%); PANDEMICS (73%); MANUFACTURING OUTPUT (72%); INTERNATIONAL TRADE (69%); ENGINEERING (68%); PRODUCT INNOVATION (68%); CLIMATE CHANGE (62%)

Whether to choose to live with the novel coronavirus or to prevent it from infecting people by completely cutting the channels of its transmission? On this, China's practice differs from that of most developed countries. This is also why those countries that have chosen the way of herd immunity have long sought to cast doubts on the way China controlled the virus.
Some countries, considering the virus to be just another kind of flu, decided to lift all control and prevention measures months ago. The Omicron variant of the virus has taught them a lesson about how transmissible and devastating it can be.
Hundreds of thousands of new cases on a daily basis have once again turned the societies of many countries into a mess, and the governments of these countries have had to tighten control and prevention measures, mandating social distancing and the wearing of a mask.
The total number of infections in the United States alone has surpassed 50 million and the death toll has reached more than 800,000, with nearly 2,000 new deaths on a daily basis.
The situation in China is in sharp contrast with that in those countries.
Putting people's lives and health before everything, China has adopted strict control and prevention measures, which has won the cooperation of its people. Everyone is required to wear a mask in any public place and big data technology has been adopted to screen close contacts of the infected. Wherever a case is identified, the measures necessary to quarantine those close contacts and monitor those indirect contacts to cut off all channels for the transmission of the virus are immediately adopted.
As a result, China has generally kept the virus at bay and become the only major country in the world which has kept its economy operating as normal in the past two years. The entire Chinese society is running as it was before the pandemic.
It is no surprise that the country was the only major economy to register positive growth in 2020. The country's economy will continue to perform in a healthy and stable manner no matter what havoc the pandemic creates in the rest of the world.
This is because the Chinese government has adopted the right approach. It is also because the country's political system and institutions have made it possible for all the control and prevention measures to be implemented smoothly from the top to the grassroots.
China's excellent export performance has protruded how its success in responding to the pandemic has facilitated the development of its economy and has also brought to prominence how the failure of some major economies in their control of the pandemic has plagued their economic performance.
It is obvious that China is injecting vitality into the global economy with its success in containing the pandemic.","COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); VACCINES (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH (89%); VIRUSES (89%); BIOLOGICS MFG (78%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (78%); FACE MASK MANDATES (78%); INFLUENZA (78%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (76%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (75%); BUSINESS NEWS (72%); DEATH RATES (71%); EXPORT TRADE (70%); DEATH & DYING (67%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (65%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (65%)

Nature, one of the world's top scientific journals, issued an editorial on Tuesday apologizing for associating the novel coronavirus with Wuhan and China in its news coverage.
It also appealed for people to stop the stigma around the disease because it fuels racism and discrimination against Asian people, which undermines their willingness to study and work in foreign universities, institutions, and other scholarly enterprises.
In February, the World Health Organization announced the disease caused by the novel coronavirus would be called COVID-19. ""The WHO was implicitly sending a reminder to those who had erroneously been associating the virus with Wuhan and with China in their news coverage — including Nature,"" the editorial said.
""That we did so was an error on our part, for which we take responsibility and apologize,"" it said. But as countries struggle to control the spread of the virus, a minority of politicians are sticking with the outdated script and insist that China bears responsibility, it said.
These officials include US President Donald Trump, Brazilian lawmaker Eduardo Bolsonaro — the son of President Jair Bolsonaro — as well as politicians from the United Kingdom, Iran, India and Australia.
""Continuing to associate a virus and the disease it causes with a specific place is irresponsible and needs to stop,"" the editorial said, adding failure to do so has resulted in people of Asian descent around the world being subjected to racist attacks.
These attacks can hurt the feelings of over 700,000 Chinese students studying at universities outside of China, and many may feel hesitant to return in part due to fears of continuing racism, along with future uncertainties over courses and travel restrictions.
""These young people will experience disruption and the loss of new connections and opportunities,"" it said. ""But the loss of students from China and other countries in Asia has wide-ranging and worrying implications for scholarly enterprise, too. It means that universities in the affected countries will become less diverse — something that has not happened for generations.""
""For decades, campuses have striven to boost diversity, and countries have enacted policies to encourage international academic mobility. Diversity is valuable for its own sake,"" it said.
""It encourages understanding and dialogue between cultures, and sharing of points of view and ways of being. And it has always been fuel for research and innovation.""
The journal's advice for world leaders is to avoid and reduce the stigma, refrain from associating COVID-19 with particular groups of people or places, and emphasize that viruses do not discriminate and everyone is at risk.
""It would be tragic if stigma, fueled by the coronavirus, led Asia's young people to retreat from international campuses, curtailing their own education, reducing their own and others' opportunities and leaving research worse off — just when the world is relying on it to find a way out.
""Coronavirus stigma must stop — now,"" the journal said.

Having recovered from month-long COVID-19, Kiyoshi Kurihara vividly recalled the bitter experience in the fight for his life.
""At first, I just had a heavy head and pains in my back, but the situation quickly turned serious overnight when I woke up in the morning,"" Kurihara said. ""I got a temperature of over 38 C, and because I tested positive myself, no hospital wants to accept me.""
With a serious headache, Kurihara was on the phone for over two hours straight just to find a hospital that would check his overall condition.
""Unsurprisingly, no one would do that,"" said Kurihara, adding that he got some medicine, food and water delivered to his home from a government health center in the end.
With the explosive surge in cases amid Japan's seventh wave of COVID-19 infections, medical institutions and public health centers are under strain, so people like Kurihara are left struggling to cope with their infections on their own.
Since the beginning of this year, Japan has seen soaring infections as Tokyo shifted to a ""living with coronavirus"" strategy, loosening restrictions and promoting social and economic activity. In July and August, Japan ranked first in the world for new infection numbers for six consecutive weeks, bringing the total number of cases in the country to 18,780,302 and total deaths to 39,600. Figures showed that at least 1 in 7 residents in Japan have been infected with COVID-19, and at least 1 in 3,189 residents have died from the coronavirus.
A health ministry survey in April found that during the sixth wave of infections from January to March, at least 555 people were found to have died of COVID-19 at home while waiting for hospital treatment.
However, the strain on medical facilities continues to grow as hospital bed occupancy rate for COVID-19 patients went over 50 percent in 33 out of 47 Japanese prefectures as of Aug 7, with 10 prefectures exceeding 70 percent. At the same time, a record of more than 1.4 million people wait to be treated in hospital as they await at home.
To make matters worse, the Japanese government was reported to have simplified its coronavirus management policy on Wednesday. Under the new policy, reporting of COVID-19 cases will be limited to patients at high risk of developing severe COVID-19, including elderly people and those with underlying conditions, according to local media.
""The government did not have adequate predictions or preparations in the seventh wave, resulting in confusion due to a series of delayed responses,"" read an editorial in the Mainichi Shimbun newspaper.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (90%); CORONAVIRUSES (89%); DEATH & DYING (89%); VIRUSES (89%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (78%); HOSPITAL OCCUPANCY RATES (78%); SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLE (78%); HEALTH CARE POLICY (75%); PUBLIC HEALTH (75%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (73%); DEATH RATES (70%); RANKINGS (70%); SENIOR CITIZENS (50%)"

""We are much closer to being able to say that the emergency phase of the pandemic is over - but we're not there yet.""
That's the core message the World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus conveyed to the world in a media briefing on Friday. Rather than being outdated, the virus control measures China carries out is a responsible answer to the call of the times, if not the urgent needs to protect people's lives and health.
More than 8,500 people around the world lost their lives last week because of COVID-19. The majority of these were reported outside of China where it is believed that so-called herd immunity has already been achieved. That should serve as a timely reminder to those questioning the necessity of the strict COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control policy of the Chinese mainland.
Although there are calls for the policy to be lifted, it is not the right time for the most populous country to lift its control on the virus, given that seasonal flus and other respiratory illnesses that are common in winter will mean a sharp rise in novel coronavirus infections that will likely be accompanied by a rise in the number of deaths attributable to COVID-19, which would undo what the nation has achieved over the past more than three years.
Saturday marked one year since the WHO announced a new variant of concern in the COVID-19 pandemic: the Omicron variant, which has proved to be significantly more transmissible than its predecessor, Delta, and continues to cause significant mortality due to the intensity of transmission, as the WHO chief said.
The number of weekly deaths reported to the WHO has declined slightly over the past five weeks, but more than 2.5 million people were infected by the virus last week, according to reports the WHO has received. At present, there are more than 500 sublineages of the Omicron strain circulating. They are all highly transmissible. But more important, these sublineages of Omicron all have mutations that enable them to escape built-up immunity more easily.
Surveillance, testing, sequencing and vaccination remain the most effective way to prevent significant mortality. That's exactly what China has been trying to do, despite the pandemic fatigue that has understandably set in among some.
What China needs is to urge local governments to adjust their virus control measures according to the actual conditions in their jurisdictions. The people-first principle should be the defining guidance of the prevention and control work. For instance, people's livelihoods must be guaranteed, any urgent need for medical care must be met promptly and people's psychological well-being should be kept an eye on.
Now as the country moves to the next stage of epidemic prevention and control, strengthening the immunization of the whole population, especially the elderly, along with increasing the handling capacities of the country's intensive care units, rather than the collective quarantine sites as home quarantine is sufficient for most light and asymptomatic cases, represent a top priority.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); DEATH & DYING (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS & BODIES (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (77%); CORONAVIRUSES (77%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (77%); INFLUENZA (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH SURVEILLANCE (77%); VIRUSES (76%); INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (73%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (72%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (72%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (72%); RESPIRATORY DISORDERS & INJURIES (72%); SURVEILLANCE (72%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (72%); VACCINES (72%); DEATH RATES (70%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (50%)

The National Health Commission stopped disclosing the daily COVID-19 pandemic data on Sunday.
That move marks the fight with the virus has entered a new stage, for the data has been widely taken as a foundation for policymaking and adjustment. It signals that more must be done to address the challenges posed by the continuous resurgence of infections nationwide.
That the public health system in Beijing, which has the most medical care resources in the country, has been under great strain because of the sharp rise of severe cases caused by the virus should serve to make the dire situations elsewhere in the country imaginable, particularly the rural areas where the gap between people's demands and the supplies of medical resources is much bigger.
Although most of those infected with the novel coronavirus recover after several days of home quarantine, the virus still poses a risk to senior residents, especially those with underlying health conditions.
China has about 270 million people aged 60 and above, and 36 million aged 80 and above, more than the total of that of all developed economies combined. While the overall capacity of China's intensive care units is much smaller in comparison with those countries. Not to mention the uneven distribution of health care resources nationwide.
That's why the COVID-19 prevention and control task force of the State Council, China's Cabinet, recently urged all local governments to prioritize treatment for the aged population, and all major hospitals to serve as the key defensive line for saving lives.
The NHC has demanded these major hospitals to double the number of intensive care unit sickbeds by the end of this month from the current 4 percent of their total number of sickbeds to at least 8 percent.
Meanwhile, local governments now need to divert their focus and inputs from nucleic acid testing and building collective quarantine stations to increasing the production and supplies of anti-fever and anti-inflammatory medicines to meet the surging demand. Local authorities should also pay attention to the scientific advice and keep the public informed of the pandemic situation.
The current wave of infections will peak and people have no reason not to remain confident in the country's fight with the virus, which continues to put saving people's lives and protecting people's health first.
Following the basic protocol of good hygiene habits, isolating at home, if one does become infected, and doing one's job well are all important contributions that individuals can make to ensure the country passes this test as quickly as possible.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); INTENSIVE CARE UNITS (89%); ISOLATION & QUARANTINE (89%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (86%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (78%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); PUBLIC POLICY (78%); VIRUSES (77%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (76%); CABINET OFFICES (64%)

When China introduced strict COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control policies three years ago, Western critics called the lockdowns imposed on Wuhan and elsewhere an inhuman medieval practice.
Yet when Western countries were forced to implement their own lockdowns to prevent their own health systems from being overwhelmed, they praised as the moves as resolute measures to protect people from the virus.
Now that the virus is displaying weakened pathogenicity and most of China's population is vaccinated, the country has taken the initiative to lift its strict virus control measures. But to these Western critics this is not of its own volition. Rather, it is because the country has had to surrender to the virus. They claim it proves that the country's dynamic clearing policy has been a failure. Of course, when their own countries reopened, it was portrayed as a calculated decision to acquire herd immunity.
Having found it impossible to explain the discrepancy between large number of deaths attributable to the virus in their own countries and the relatively low number in China, they are predicting a tsunami of COVID deaths in China now that, according to them, the country has been ""forced"" to ""abruptly"" end its former pandemic control policies.
While the Chinese economy has maintained sizable growth, and demonstrated its resilience and potential even at the most difficult time, these critics clamor that the world's second-largest economy is collapsing.
When China selflessly provides vaccines, essential medical care supplies and life necessities to the rest of the world, they claim the vaccines and medical items do not work, and China is making a fortune out of other's misfortune.
Even though China remains a reliable trade partner and a driver of the global economy as a manufacturing center, logistics hub and key link in the global industry and supply chains, these critics spread alarmist fear that China's COVID policies are threatening the stability of world trade and foreign companies are losing confidence in it.
Calling black white, they turn a blind eye to which countries are trying to collude with each other to weaponize trade, investment and technology to hijack the world economy for their own narrow ends.
They also choose to ignore the gap in medical care resources between China and their own countries, as well as China's development stage and the size of its population, taking every opportunity to hype up any medical supply shortage after the adjustment of the COVID-19 policies as fault or failure of the Chinese government. Something none of their own countries proved to be able to do even with their more developed medical care conditions and much smaller populations.

Just as it failed to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus, the United States is failing in its response to the spread of the monkeypox virus as the number of cases has increased to 16,603 as of August 24, the largest of all countries. As of Sunday, the virus had been detected in all 50 states in the country.
That this happens despite it having suitable vaccines in its Strategic National Stockpile points to the serious flaws in its social governance.
When the first monkeypox infection was reported in the US in May, the Joe Biden administration sent a confident message, which came to: We've got this.
However, they haven't. The measures that should have been taken have remained a lip service. The country has obviously not learned the lessons from its poor response to the COVID-19 pandemic, which has resulted in the US having the largest number of COVID-19 infections and deaths due to the disease in all countries.
Then what has gone wrong? Why did it fail in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic and now to the monkeypox pandemic?
The political system in the US is ailing. Those in power have been too preoccupied with bipartisan struggles to pay attention to the making and implementation of specific policies to ensure people's well-being. Winning elections and beating political rivals have been placed above the public good.
Such a twisted practice means the political parties in the US have parted company with the people, and they are now just playing political games within their own circle. Politics for the sake of politics has become the harmful reality of the US.
This has emasculated the social governance of the US as it has rendered the governing bodies at all levels ineffective. As a result, preemptive measures to contain the spread of the monkeypox virus upon its appearance have failed to be taken. Foot dragging thereafter has made the US health department miss every opportunity possible to contain the spread of the virus.
On the current evidence, it is clear that the US will not be able to respond effectively to any health hazards to come. It will not be able to protect its people from future outbreaks of deadly diseases, which experts say are likely to become more frequent as a consequence of climate change.
The US always points its fingers at other countries when it comes to the issues of human rights. But it is indeed high time that it carefully examined its own human rights conditions. Its failed responses to the novel coronavirus and monkeypox virus show it has failed to safeguard people's right to health.
The US needs to be reminded that it should put its own house in order first before lecturing other countries.",VIRUSES (91%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (90%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); ELECTIONS & POLITICS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); POLITICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); HUMAN RIGHTS (78%); BIPARTISANSHIP (77%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (77%); US POLITICAL PARTIES (77%); VACCINES (73%); POLITICAL ORGANIZATIONS (72%); POLITICAL PARTIES (72%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (69%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (69%)

Nigeria destroyed more than 1 million doses of expired AstraZeneca vaccines on Dec 22. And the country's health officials said that Nigeria will no longer accept vaccines with a short shelf life.
Senegal will reportedly destroy 400,000 doses of COVID-19 vaccines before the end of this year. And in May, Malawi destroyed 20,000 doses of expired COVID-19 vaccines, and the Democratic Republic of Congo returned 1.3 million doses of vaccines to Western donors as it had no time to administer the vaccines before they expired.
What if these vaccines had been donated by China? The Western media would have been in an uproar. Not surprisingly, there has been a studied silence as the country that has donated most of the expired and soon-to-expire vaccines is the United States. The World Health Organization has called on donor countries to improve the quality of the vaccines they donate to African countries.
Statistics show that till July this year, the amount of COVID-19 vaccines the US had hoarded was far more than its domestic need. It has been estimated that the US and its allies have hoarded millions of doses of COVID-19 vaccines in total.
With the hoarded vaccines soon to expire they are releasing them to fulfill their vaccine donation commitments. According to COVAX, an initiative to ensure vaccine accessibility worldwide led by the WHO, the Western countries often make impromptu donations of short shelf-life vaccines to African countries giving them no advance notice.
Given the conditions in the African countries, where it takes longer to administer vaccines, not to mention the stringent and challenging requirements for the storage and transportation of the Western vaccines, the Western countries' donations are more like dumping their medical waste in Africa.
To some extent, the surfacing of the Omicron variant in Africa is not an accident but a consequence of delayed vaccination in African countries — only 7.5 percent of the 1.3 billion people living in Africa have been vaccinated — which might prompt the Western countries to hoard their vaccines again in the future.
It has been at a high cost in terms of lives lost and people's sufferings, but the COVID-19 pandemic has proved that the world is a community with a shared future. Recognizing this, China has so far provided nearly 2 billion doses of vaccines to more than 120 countries and international organizations. More importantly, it is outsourcing the production of its COVID-19 vaccines to other developing countries so that they can make the vaccines themselves.
China's motive for doing so originates from its firm belief that until the virus withdraws from its last foothold in the world, no country is safe.","VACCINES (96%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); LANDFILLS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (89%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); VIRUSES (78%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (74%); DEMOCRACIES (73%); MEDICAL WASTE & BIOHAZARDS (72%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (71%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (69%); STATISTICS (66%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (66%); OUTSOURCING (50%)

2021-12-28,West's vaccine donation vow rings hollow: China Daily editorial,China Daily,495,"chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2022-03-21 19:35
Due to the two parties' divergences on its distribution, the United States Senate rejected $15.6 billion in funding for COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control in a government funding bill US President Joe Biden signed on Tuesday last week.
With nearly 1 million COVID-19 deaths and cumulative infections of more than 81 million, the US, with 4.45 percent of the world population, counts for 17 percent of the COVID-19 infections and 16 percent of the COVID-19 deaths worldwide, making it the worst-hit country.
As such, it is easy to understand why the decision to reject the COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control funding in the bill has irked many in the country, as it serves to expose the extent to which US politicians are willing to sacrifice people's health and life for their narrow ends, if not the interests of partisan politics.
The Biden administration had initially requested $30 billion, only to reduce it to $22.5 billion and, finally, to $15.6 billion. But even with the amount halved, Republicans were unwilling to authorize more money without cuts elsewhere or a full accounting from the Biden administration of the already approved virus funding.
The decision laid bare to the world how political interests can ride roughshod over people's lives in a country that often lectures others on human rights. Partisan factionalism and political polarization are worsening the social ills in the country, dragging the US into a dangerous situation.
The US' dealing with the novel coronavirus over the past two years, ranging from vaccination to the allocation of pandemic prevention and control funding, has always been abducted by politics.
As the US Government Accountability Office has pointed out, the US Department of Health and Human Services has failed to play its due role in the response to the outbreak, displaying ""persistent deficiencies"", including unclear federal, state and regional roles and responsibilities, failure to properly collect and analyze epidemic data, lack of transparency and lack of communication with the public.
To some extent, the pandemic has exposed, if not enlarged, the institutional loopholes in the US political system which has enabled power holders to become increasingly fearless and shameless in shirking their responsibilities, and manipulating public opinion for their own interests.
The US still has a long way to go to normalize social life. And if, as some experts warn, new variants of the virus appear over the next 12 months, about 80 percent of the US population will be infected, and even if the death rate is lowered to 0.1 percent, another 264,000 lives will be lost by March next year.
When asked on Thursday why the COVID relief funding is absent from the aforementioned bill, Nancy Pelosi, the House speaker, who was visibly annoyed by that, said ""people are dying in the Ukraine and all of that"".
Yeah, but people are dying of COVID too, as the reporter shot back.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); ELECTIONS & POLITICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); POLITICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); US CONGRESS (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); PARTISANSHIP (89%); POPULATION SIZE (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); GOVERNMENT CONTROLLERS & AUDITORS (78%); LEGISLATIVE BODIES (78%); SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLE (78%); US REPUBLICAN PARTY (78%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (77%); CORONAVIRUSES (77%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (77%); NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWS (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (77%); SOCIAL SERVICES DEPARTMENTS (77%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (77%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (77%); DEATH RATES (76%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (76%); POPULATION & DEMOGRAPHICS (76%); US PRESIDENTS (73%); VACCINES (73%); DEATH & DYING (72%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (71%); VIRUSES (70%); APPROVALS (51%)"

With the orderly implementation of the optimized COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control measures, the growth speed of the Chinese economy will continue to gather steam.
That is a core message Premier Li Keqiang conveyed to the world during the Seventh ""1+6"" Roundtable dialogue held in Huangshan, Anhui province, on Friday, during which he met with the leaders of six major world economy, finance and trade bodies.
As he said, in the face of the impact of COVID-19 and other factors that exceeded expectations this year, China promptly introduced a package of policy measures to stabilize the economy, which quickly reversed the economic downturn in the early second quarter, and the economy is now recovering and stabilizing. On the whole, China has maintained stable employment and prices, stabilized the macroeconomic market, and kept its economic performance within a proper range.
Li's reiterating of China's commitment to advancing opening-up at a high level and steadily expanding institutional opening-up, as well as the country's consistent hospitality to foreign investment and business should serve to instill confidence that the world's second-largest economy is gearing up to regain its pre-pandemic interaction with the world.
The positive responses from these international organizations' leaders to Li's remarks also reflect the world's expectation, if not need, for China to overcome the hindrances of the pandemic as quickly as possible to boost the sustainable and balanced recovery of the world economy by better fulfilling its roles as the world's largest manufacturing base, leading trader in goods and major investor.
According to a news briefing on the dialogue, the participants from the six organizations agreed that the world cannot develop without China, and China is an important engine for world economic growth. They remain optimistic about the prospects of China's economic development, and they welcome China's adjustment of its epidemic prevention and control policies, believing that it will strengthen the momentum of economic recovery in China and enable it to further open up, boosting the sustainable and balanced recovery of the world economy.
While some of the relatively less-developed inland areas are still holding a wait-and-see attitude to the effects of the policy changes, the coastal governments have taken the adjusted policy as a green light to act. Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Fujian and Guangdong provinces, the most vibrant coastal growth engines, all approved and supported overseas business trips as soon as the virus control policies were eased last week. That indicates their willingness to rebalance their focus between virus control and boosting and promoting business exchanges.
It is imperative that governments at various levels act with similar urgency to reboot the economy. For more than three years, the local governments have never ceased talking about their earnest intentions to improve the business environment under their watch and attract investment and talents.

It has become the norm for Western countries to portray China's rise as a threat to the rest of the world. Yet what China has done over the past two years to help other countries in their fight against the novel coronavirus shows how false their cries of alarm are.
By early November, China had provided more than 1.7 billion doses of vaccines to the world, benefitting more than 110 countries and international organizations. It aims to provide 2 billion doses by the end of the year.
China has also supplied over 70 million doses of vaccines to COVAX, and donated $100 million to the World Health Organization plan. It has co-launched the Belt and Road vaccine cooperation partnership initiative with 28 countries, and has organized joint COVID-19 vaccine production with 19 developing countries.
China, a developing country itself, is the main source of vaccines obtained by other developing countries as well as the biggest supplier of COVID-19 vaccines to the world.
China can confidently say that it has supplied the most COVID-19 vaccines to the world, without fear of contradiction.
Yet some Western politicians and media continue to denigrate China's efforts. As early as December 2020, when China announced major progress in clinical tests of its COVID-19 vaccines, they claimed China was engaged in a ""vaccine race"".
When China donates vaccines to the world, it is said to be practicing ""vaccine diplomacy"", despite the fact that China has never attached any conditions to its vaccine assistance.
Now they are trying to cast doubts on the safety and effectiveness of Chinese vaccines, despite the fact that Chinese vaccines have proved their effectiveness.
Such claims display the selfishness of those Western politicians who are willing to put the lives and health of hundreds of millions of people at risk to protect the West's privileges.
If these politicians are unwilling to offer a helping hand to others, the least they can do is not to point accusing fingers at China.
The COVID-19 pandemic is spreading again. According to reports, from Nov 8 to 14, the world saw 3.4 million new infections, 300,000 more than that of the preceding week.
Yet the developed countries in the West are still failing to honor their promises to supply vaccines to other countries in need. In June, the G7 countries promised to donate 1 billion COVID-19 vaccines to the world by the end of 2021. Its members separately promised more. The US president has even compared his country's role in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic to the one it played in World War II.
Yet with 43 days left to the end of the year, the US has only provided 13.5 percent of its promised quota. There has been no mention of when the remainder will be forthcoming.
Instead of assistance, they offer nice gestures, nice words and a nice comparison. It's just a show.","VACCINES (96%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); ELECTIONS & POLITICS (89%); EPIDEMICS (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); SAFETY (78%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (77%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (74%); BIOLOGICS MFG (73%); VIRUSES (73%); CORONAVIRUSES (70%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (69%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (53%)

That the world has recovered from previous pandemics is by no means a reason that people should do nothing and simply wait for the current pandemic to run its course. It should not be forgotten that people did what they could to save lives during previous pandemics despite their lack of medical know-how and the means. So why are so many countries today throwing in the towel when they still can fight against the novel coronavirus that is killing thousands of people a day?
In many Western countries, where the disease is portrayed as a one-week self-healable sickness, it is the limitations inherent in their systems that fundamentally serve the interests of the rich that have prompted governments to quit the fight in defeat, since it is the poor and other vulnerable groups that pay the price for surrender to the virus.
These governments have brainwashed the poor and vulnerable into believing that death due to COVID-19 is a lottery governed by nature's survival-of-the-fittest law.
While the pandemic's death toll in countries such as the United States continues to tick higher, one life after another, the wealth of the rich has increased exponentially.
The rich don't want any constraints on their wealth streams no matter the cost in lives.
The pandemic should have provided the Western politicians with an opportunity to demonstrate the social fairness and justice that they take pride in boasting of by tilting more resources from the rich to take care of the poor. But instead it has done the opposite.
Statistics show that among the top 20 countries that have the highest COVID-19 deaths per 100,000 population 14 are Western countries that are the most developed and richest in the world. This is not coincidental. The pandemic has revealed how polarized these developed countries have become following the rich-take-all rule.
To whitewash this, some Western politicians have been pooling their efforts to denigrate China's effective life-saving dynamic clearing policy as authoritarian and inhuman.
If China had a pandemic mortality rate in line even with the average of the other four BRICS countries - Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa - which are at a similar development stage, the novel coronavirus would have claimed 2.7 million lives on the Chinese mainland so far. Instead, the figure is about 5,200, as of the middle of this month. With nearly one-fifth of the world's population, it only accounts for 0.08 percent of the total COVID-19 deaths, and its COVID-19 mortality rate ranks third last among all countries and regions.
It is China's virus prevention and control policy that truly puts people's well-being first, not the richer-get-richer pandemic policies of the West.",

The Irish nationalist party Sinn Fein's victory on Saturday in the elections in Northern Ireland, which dealt a historic election defeat to pro-UK unionists, looks set to be the harbinger of a new era for Northern Ireland, one that spells more political uncertainty and trouble for the United Kingdom and its embattled Prime Minister Boris Johnson.
Once the political wing of the pro-unity paramilitary Irish Republican Army and the long-time advocate for the reunification of Ireland, Sinn Fein won enough seats in the devolved legislature to nominate its leader Michelle O'Neill as first minister, effectively the devolved parliament's prime minister.
Although Sinn Fein's victory may not immediately bring about a referendum on a united Ireland, it certainly gives a shot in the arm to realizing the party's long-established political goal.
For Johnson, the political earthquake in Northern Island has added to his many headaches. Not only did the Conservative Party suffer huge losses in recent local elections but he faces growing calls for his resignation, not only from the opposition but even from members of his own party, over the Partygate scandal and his lying to Parliament, having recently been fined by the police for breaking his own COVID-19 lockdown rules by attending a birthday party for him in Downing Street in June 2020.
Since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the UK government has also been under criticism for its lax and inefficient anti-pandemic performance. In February, the government announced the United Kingdom would co-exist with the deadly virus, leading to a sharp spike in the number of COVID-19 cases. To date, the total number of COVID-19 deaths in the UK is nearly 180,000.
Yet rather than concentrating on addressing the mounting problems at home, Johnson and his government have tried to divert the public's attention by hyping up external issues. From jumping on the United States' Indo-Pacific bandwagon to advocating NATO's global expansion and playing a vanguard role in the US-led sanctions against Russia.
The UK government has also been blatantly interfering in China's internal affairs in Hong Kong and Xinjiang and even Taiwan. By doing so, the Johnson government hopes to present the image of a ""global Britain"" to foster nationalist sentiment at home in an attempt to insulate itself from the charges of domestic critics, who accuse it of acting deceitfully, dishonorably and disreputably.
Fuelling the public's patriotic passions with the mistaken impression that Britannia still rules the waves only encourages the Johnson government to escalate its overseas follies. Instead of trying to create problems for others, it would better serve the UK people, itself and the world by focusing on addressing the many acute problems and issues at home.",

It is telling that some see the ""madness"" in China's COVID-19 policy but they cannot see the ""madness"" with which their own countries have been dealing with the virus.
In an article published by The Wall Street Journal on Friday, Holman W. Jenkins Jr, a member of the newspaper's editorial board, compared China's virus control policy to ""authoritarian madness"", citing the lockdowns of Shanghai and Shenzhen as examples, and declaring that ""China turns COVID victory into defeat"".
Jenkins and others who criticize China's epidemic prevention and control efforts, lazily yet deliberately distort China's measures with the tropes of authoritarianism. Bereft of neutrality and objectivity, they fail to explain the scientific rationale for those efforts or the consequences of the alternative course of action that they endorse, which have been so tragically evident in their own countries.
In the United States, for example, people's lives, particularly those of the poor, the colored and the elderly, have, in effect, been sacrificed for partisan politics, and the buck-passing between the federal and local governments.
With less than 4 percent of the world's population, the US accounts for about 16 percent of COVID-19 infections and deaths worldwide. With about 19 percent of the world's population, China's COVID-19 infections and deaths over the past more than two years have been less than those of the US in one month on average.
The argument of Jenkins is self-contradictory, as he admits China's ""COVID victory"" even as he denies it.
Some Western media mocked the lockdown of Wuhan more than two years ago. Yet what has unfolded since has highlighted their shortsightedness. It is ridiculous that some of them still display the same ignorance, hypocrisy and prejudice after what has transpired in their countries compared with the situation in China over the past two years.
To call China's successful people-first response ""mad"", while taking the US' failed politics-first approach to be ""normal"" is to deny the data that show that the Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus is not ""flu plus"".
Even as China's response has become more experienced, better organized and more efficient thanks to big data and other technologies, some Western media can't hide their delight at seizing the opportunity to distort China to fit their chosen mold and to indulge in some schadenfreude at China's expense.
The WSJ article is a sorry indictment of the mentality that prevails among some in the US when it comes to China.",

In her statement on Saturday, at the end of her official visit to China over the previous six days, UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Michelle Bachelet came straight to the point, saying her visit was not an ""investigation"", but an opportunity to promote exchanges and interactions.
Indeed, the concerns that she did raise over China's human rights conditions - some of which are common challenges confronting countries - are the fields in which the two sides will make joint efforts to work on in a ""meaningful and impactful"" way.
As well as speaking with President Xi Jinping by video link during her tour, the human rights chief of the United Nations visited Kashgar prison and the Kashgar Experimental School, a former Vocational Education and Training Centre, among other places, in the Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region, and interacted with civil society organizations, academics, and community and religious leaders and others inside and outside the country as well.
Her trip and statement have been criticized by those heavily invested in smearing China on its human rights practices as she never once mentioned ""genocide"" - a crime these smearers have been keen to pin on China for its policies in Xinjiang - and has neither substantiated their claims, nor voiced any official concerns about China's human rights conditions. Indeed, she did the opposite by acknowledging China's achievements in human rights protection, and vowing to strengthen exchanges and cooperation in the future to make it better.
No wonder some rights groups on the payroll of Washington scolded the UN human rights chief immediately after she made the statement.
Their heartfelt disappointment will no doubt be reflected in a statement issued by the US State Department or some agency or another decrying the UN human rights chief being hoodwinked and calling for a US-led probe into the issue. A trick the US has played many a time whenever an international organization has failed to support one of its China-is-bad claims after a visit to the country, with the World Health Organization's COVID-19 research in China being an obvious recent example.
China has always put people first in its development, with nearly 20 percent of world population it accounts for 0.08 percent of the COVID-19 deaths worldwide in contrast with the US that accounts for about 17 percent of COVID-19 death with less than 4 percent of world population, and its achievements in poverty reduction, gender equity and introduction of universal healthcare and almost universal unemployment insurance scheme are important contributions it has made to the world's human rights cause.
History proves that the human rights development path China has taken fits the country's actual conditions and is effective in improving the lives of its people. The remarkable development achievement of China belies the fallacy of the China-bashers' attempt to smear the country's human rights cause, which is nothing but part of their China containment strategy.","HUMAN RIGHTS (92%); NEGATIVE NEWS (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); UNITED NATIONS (90%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (89%); INVESTIGATIONS (89%); POPULATION SIZE (89%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (89%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (84%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (84%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (84%); HUMAN RIGHTS VIOLATIONS (78%); SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLE (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (77%); NEGATIVE SOCIETAL NEWS (77%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (75%); EDUCATION & TRAINING (73%); GENDER EQUALITY (73%); GENOCIDE (72%); VOCATIONAL & TECHNICAL TRAINING (68%); UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE (65%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (62%); NEGATIVE EMPLOYMENT NEWS (60%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (60%); CLERGY & RELIGIOUS VOCATIONS (53%); RELIGION (53%)"

Two Chinese pharmaceutical companies will provide 110 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines immediately to participants of COVAX, a global vaccine-sharing project, the global Vaccine Alliance, Gavi, has announced.
""The addition of the Sinopharm and Sinovac vaccines further diversifies the Gavi-managed COVAX Facility portfolio, which now includes 11 vaccines and vaccine candidates,"" Gavi said in a statement.
The move, which comes after the two Chinese companies' vaccines were approved earlier this year by the World Health Organization for emergency use, will serve as a timely boost to the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic as novel coronavirus variants, such as highly transmissible Delta, are posing increasing risks to people worldwide and putting renewed pressure on health systems around the world.
It will also help narrow the severe gaps in global vaccine supply, caused mainly by the rise of ""vaccine nationalism"" that has seen a handful of rich nations taking the lion's share of vaccines while many poor nations have had little or no access to vaccines. A potential total supply of 550 million vaccine doses by Sinopharm and Sinovac to COVAX by the first half of 2022 will certainly ensure more equitable distribution of vaccines among nations.
China, which has pledged to make its vaccines a global public good, has already supplied 500 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines and concentrates to more than 100 countries and international organizations, accounting for one-sixth of the current global COVID-19 vaccine output. Indeed, China has provided more doses to developing countries than any other country and has vaccine cooperation partners around the world.
The popularity of Chinese vaccines in so many countries stems from their tested and proven efficacy in trials in different countries. A study published recently in the top medical journal The Lancet said that two doses of the CoronaVac vaccine developed by Sinovac offer 83.5 percent protection against symptomatic COVID-19, and it also has some advantages for use by developing countries. ""One of the advantages of CoronaVac is that it does not need to be frozen, making it easier to transport and distribute. This could be particularly important for global distribution as some countries may struggle to store large amounts of vaccine at very low temperatures,"" said the lead author of the paper, Murat Akova from Hacettepe University Medical School in Turkey.
If more vaccines are provided to COVAX and other countries follow China's example and share their know-how it will help bring the pandemic under control as soon as possible.

Wearing masks can reduce the spread of COVID-19 by half, according to a major systematic review of global public health measures conducted by researchers in the United Kingdom and Australia.
The review, published this week in the British Medical Journal, or BMJ, found that hand washing and social distancing also greatly reduce the spread of the virus. The researchers said that this evidence supports a continuation of non-pharmaceutical interventions during the pandemic, especially in places where vaccination rates remain low.
Scientists from Edinburgh University in Scotland and Monash University in Australia reviewed more than 30 studies on public health measures around the globe, and found that mask wearing cut COVID-19 rates by 53 percent, and physical distancing was linked to a reduction of 25 percent. The review also found that hand-washing was linked to a 53 percent reduction, though this finding was not statistically significant due to a small sample size.
""It is likely that further control of the COVID-19 pandemic depends not only on high vaccination coverage and its effectiveness, but also on ongoing adherence to effective and sustainable public health measures,"" said the authors of the study, which include lead researcher Stella Talic, an epidemiologist at Monash University.
The authors said that until herd immunity to COVID-19 is reached, and regardless of high vaccination rates, public health preventive strategies ""are likely to remain as first choice measures in disease prevention.
""Current evidence from quantitative analyses indicates a benefit associated with hand-washing, mask wearing, and physical distancing in reducing the incidence of COVID-19,"" the study said.
Several European nations, including Romania and the Netherlands, recently reintroduced mask mandates for public spaces, because of a rise in cases.
However, some countries, including the UK and Hungary, have not revisited mask wearing, despite a significant growth in infections during the fall.
The UK has lifted almost all social distancing measures in England in favor of a drug-focused strategy. The government recently ordered more than half a million courses of antiviral pills to combat an expected surge of cases this winter, and as of this week, UK health services have administered 13 million boosters, or third doses of vaccine.
The review also looked at the impact of other non-medical interventions on the spread of the virus, including lockdowns, quarantining, isolation and ventilation in schools and public buildings.
However, researchers were unable to draw firm conclusions in some of these areas due to issues with the quality and quantity of research.
An editorial from the BMJ lamented a lack of funding for studies into non-pharmaceutical interventions during the pandemic. Just 4 percent of global research funding has gone into such studies, the BMJ said, with the vast majority of money funneled into drug research.

The necessity to err on the side of caution should be the lesson the world has learned from the repeated waves of infections caused by the different variants of the novel coronavirus.
It is not yet known if the new variant Omicron causes more virulent disease than the past variants. But what is known is that Omicron is extremely contagious. ""Omicron is spreading at a rate we have not seen with any previous variant,"" World Health Organization Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said during a COVID-19 update in Geneva on Tuesday.
Omicron cases have been reported in more than 70 countries and it might have already spread to more countries, although cases have not been identified.
On Wednesday alone, the number of new cases detected worldwide reached more than 700,000. Jenny Harries, head of the UK Health Security Agency, said that Omicron is displaying a staggering growth rate compared with previous variants.
""Even if Omicron does cause less severe disease, the sheer number of cases could once again overwhelm unprepared health systems,"" Tedros said.
The WHO's COVID-19 technical lead, Maria van Kerkhove, warned that the risks of the Omicron strain should not be taken lightly or dismissed. ""We have to be really careful that there isn't a narrative out there that it's just a mild disease.""
She said that people infected with Omicron have shown the full spectrum of COVID-19, from asymptomatic infection to mild disease, all the way to severe disease and deaths.
With the arrival of Omicron, governments everywhere must bite the bullet and enforce prevention and control measures to get control of the virus, no matter how unpopular such moves may be with the public.
While the vaccines that are being administered are important, they cannot be relied on alone to fight the virus. It is not yet known when effective medicines will be developed to prevent humans from being infected and to effectively fight against the virus — or if that is even possible.
The WHO officials emphasized the importance of people wearing masks, observing social distancing and washing their hands.
That is exactly what China has been mandating. That is how the country has generally kept the virus under control and guaranteed the normal operation of its economy.
The Omicron variant is another wakeup call that it is just wishful thinking to assume that humans can live with the virus without implementing strict prevention and control measures.

2021-12-16,Don't underestimate risks of surging Omicron: China Daily editorial,China Daily,542,"chinadaily.com.cn | Updated: 2022-01-26 20:13

Given the numbers of infections, at around 100,500, and related deaths, at around 4,600, recorded over the past more than two years, and the relatively swift resumption of economic activities, China's fight against the COVID-19 pandemic should be considered successful. Especially when viewed in relation to the situation elsewhere.
More than 354 million people have been infected with the novel coronavirus globally and the disease has claimed over 5.6 million lives, while devastating the world economy.
The dynamic prevention and control measures China has adopted, including lockdowns, mass testing and contact tracing, have kept the number of infections and deaths low while keeping the country's economic activities and people's livelihoods basically on a normal track, albeit with some inconvenience caused to local residents because of a sometimes rushed response by health officials in some COVID 19-hit places due to either mismanagement or a lack of capability.
But the fact that China's economy expanded 8.1 percent last year points to the well-coordinated work the government has done to maintain steady economic momentum while keeping the virus generally at bay.
Thus it is strange and even incomprehensible that some media outlets in the West have pointed an accusing finger at China for its efforts to try to curb the spread of the virus, describing the country as being out of step with the rest of the world while playing a ""lonely game of COVID whack-a-hamster"". The New York Times even called China's COVID-19 policy ""a pandemic waiting to happen"" because it has left the country wholly ""unprepared for what will become endemic COVID"".
China's way of dealing with the pandemic may not be necessarily applicable or even feasible in other countries due to their different political systems and social conditions. Countries must consider their own realities and devise anti-virus policies that best suit their own situations; there is no one-size-fits-all approach.
Yet what these Western media have failed to mention is the relative ease at which the country found itself just months ago when the more transmissible Omicron variant was first detected, which forced countries around the world to scramble to impose travel bans to stem its spread.
Given that much still remains unknown about the variant and the fact that more variants might emerge in the days to come, maintaining its dynamic response to any infections while continuing to explore new ways to control the spread of the virus is the best option for China, especially with the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympic Games scheduled to start on Feb 4.
In the face of this unprecedented challenge to public health, the most pressing task that nations face is how to narrow the immunity gap around the world by pooling their wisdom and medical resources in the spirit of unity and mutual understanding.
Painting a doomsday picture of the situation in China just because it has a different, and more effective, way of dealing with the coronavirus is meanly conjectural, and obviously does not serve that purpose.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); BUSINESS NEWS (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (78%); DISEASE CONTACT TRACING (78%); DEATH & DYING (77%); DEATH RATES (77%); VIRUSES (77%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (76%); ECONOMICS (76%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (73%); OLYMPICS (72%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (72%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (72%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (71%); WINTER OLYMPICS (50%)

Governments, politicians and media outlets have called for a science-based approach to tracing the origins of the coronavirus while speaking out against the politicization of the issue.
Their comments came amid intensified efforts by the United States to spread disinformation on the subject.
The politicization of virus origin tracing, as well as COVID-19 vaccines, should be rejected, the Lao Foreign Ministry said in a recent statement. The ministry said studies into the origin of the virus require objectivity and transparency, with a purely scientific-based approach.
""The COVID-19 pandemic is unprecedented and has brought about untold consequences to lives and the socioeconomic development of the world. No one is safe until everyone is safe,"" said the statement posted on the ministry's website on Thursday.
Only through multilateral cooperation can all nations, especially developing ones, have equal access to vaccines and medicines and thus lead to the defeat of COVID-19, the statement added.
New Zealand Foreign Minister Nanaia Mahuta, in an interview with Radio New Zealand on Friday, said the approach to COVID-19 origin tracing ""has to be evidence-based and scientifically based"".
""We very much rely on the scientific evidence and there needed to be a further investigation ... our position remains the same as it was,"" Mahuta said.
The South African Communist Party on Thursday released a statement denouncing the attempts to politicize COVID-19.
In the statement, the party said studies into the origin of the coronavirus are a scientific undertaking. This means they should be viewed in a science-based, objective and fair manner in the interests of advancing global cooperation against the pandemic.
""In this era of pandemics, scientific collaboration across our globe is critical for progress and for the protection of human society. The scientific field of origin or source tracing of viruses is a critical instrument in the campaign against their spread,"" the statement added.
The scientific findings include the recognition that there are indications that COVID-19 infections emerged before December 2019 in various places across the globe, it added.
Distorting facts
Maldives News Network senior editor Hamdhan Shakeel wrote in an editorial published on Friday that Western countries have attempted to politicize the origin-tracing issue by distorting the facts and shifting the blame onto China.
According to a CGTN Think Tank online opinion poll released on Monday, 80 percent of global respondents believe that the issue has been politicized. The poll was accessed in a number of United Nations official languages, including Chinese, English, Russian, French, Spanish and Arabic.
Shakeel said the task of determining the origin of the virus is far from easy. The editor noted that it took nearly two decades for scientists to identify patient zero in the HIV/AIDS epidemic. In the case of the Ebola epidemic, scientists have been researching its origin since the 1970s.
These difficulties illustrate that virus origin tracing is highly scientific work, and its politicization will ""undoubtedly interfere and obstruct the scientific effort"" required to combat the next pandemic, Shakeel said.

With the developed countries having flexed their financial muscles to gain pole position in the race to acquire COVID-19 vaccines, the World Health Organization's green light to a second Chinese vaccine is good news for those countries that have been pushed to the back of the chasing pack.
Especially as its ""easy storage requirements make it very manageable and particularly suitable for low-resource settings,"" as WHO Assistant Director-General for Access to Medicines and Health Products Mariangela Simao said in a statement announcing the news on Tuesday.
The WHO's approval of the vaccine provides a big boost to the world, which ""desperately needs multiple COVID-19 vaccines to address the huge access inequity across the globe"".
Those countries that were anxiously awaiting the WHO's endorsement as a domestic legal requirement to import the vaccine will have heaved a sigh of relief as they will now be able to open their doors to it. And, having already approved the Sinopharm COVID-19 vaccine for emergency use last month, the WHO's nod to the Sinovac vaccine means the COVAX program will now be provided with both of the major vaccines produced by the world's largest manufacturer of COVID-19 vaccines. Through COVAX, the WHO has distributed roughly 60 million doses so far to developing countries. But that's a far cry from its goal of 2 billion doses for this year.
China is doing what it can. The Chinese Foreign Ministry announced on Tuesday, that production of the first batch it has pledged to provide the COVAX program, 10 million doses, has now been completed. In all, China has produced about 900 million doses of vaccines so far, of which more than 600 million doses have been administered at home, and the rest donated to more than 80 developing countries and exported to more than 50 countries. The safety and efficacy of the Chinese vaccines have been fully proved by these countries.
As one of the first countries to vow to make its vaccines global public goods and call on other major vaccine producing countries to follow suit, China has taken concrete actions to fulfill its pledge. It is not only the largest contributor of vaccines to the world, but also one of the most active promoters of coordinated international efforts to fight the virus. The country supports waiving intellectual property rights on COVID-19 vaccines, and it is encouraging its vaccine developers to carry out joint production with other developing countries.
This is in stark contrast to some of the developed countries, which have hoarded vaccines beyond their actual needs. Which explains why African countries account for only 1 percent of the administered doses worldwide.
It is estimated that China can produce 3 billion doses of the vaccines by the end of this year, and its production capacity will reach 8 billion doses next year. That means it is set to serve as the main source of bullets in the global war against the virus.","VACCINES (97%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); APPROVALS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); CORONAVIRUSES (89%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (89%); VIRUSES (89%); HEALTH CARE ACCESS (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (78%); INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (77%); DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY (77%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (77%); SAFETY (77%); EXPORT TRADE (76%); IMPORT TRADE (76%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (76%); PRESCRIPTION DRUG IMPORTS (72%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (72%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (71%); STATE DEPARTMENTS & FOREIGN SERVICES (71%); ALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPS (61%)

The United States and other wealthy nations are called to look in the mirror as a stark contrast emerges between rich and poor countries in terms of the number of people who have received at least one shot of the COVID-19 vaccine, according to an opinion piece published by the Washington Post on Monday.
Only five percent of eligible people in low-income countries have received at least one shot of the COVID-19 vaccine, while the number in high-income and upper-middle-income nations is 73 percent, and in lower- to middle-income countries 41 percent, said the article.
According to the Post's Editorial Board, to date, with the help of the COVAX facility, which is created to ensure equitable distribution of vaccines, 522 million doses have been delivered to 144 countries, most of it to the poorer nations.
""That's certainly millions of people helped, but it has been slower than expected, and the wait is agonizing,"" commented the article.
An early target for COVAX was to acquire and distribute 2 billion doses by the end of this year.
The COVAX experience has ""exposed how the haves took care of themselves, and the have-nots have been forced to wait"".
The newspaper thinks that a lack of continuing funds of COVAX contributed to the lag, adding the first lesson learned is ""in the future, some kind of contingent funds, ready to go early in a crisis, would be a huge headstart.""
Another lesson is that a global network of sustainable, quality vaccine manufacturing facilities is essential to fight a pandemic, but it does not yet exist.
With the above-mentioned lessons drawn from the current pandemic, countries are called to renew their efforts to ""prepare a rescue ship before the storm: financing, factories and know-how poised to go at a moment's notice"".","VACCINES (95%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); UPPER INCOME PERSONS (77%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (77%); BIOLOGICS MFG (73%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (72%); SUSTAINABLE MANUFACTURING (61%)

As the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic drags on, equitable and mass vaccination is the only emergency lever that countries can pull to put the brakes on the spread of the novel coronavirus and so save lives and get their economies back on their feet.
Yet the way vaccines are being distributed around the world is not only ""unequal and very unfair"", as United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said, but also a failure to make the best use of them to stop the train wreck of the pandemic from piling up. The ""vaccine divide"" between rich and poor nations, instead of being narrowed along with increasing development and production by vaccine producing countries, remains deplorably large.
Of the 2.6 billion doses administered worldwide, only 0.3 percent have been in low-income countries. The World Health Organization estimates that on average, in high-income countries, one in four people have received a COVID-19 vaccine, while in low-income countries, the figure is one in more than 500. Reportedly, the United Kingdom has ordered 517 million doses, although it requires only around 160 million to vaccinate all adults and give them booster jabs in the autumn, as planned.
The uneven situation, caused mainly by the so-called vaccine nationalism with certain countries having stockpiled vaccine doses far above their needs, not only represents a catastrophic moral failure, but also risks undoing what the world has achieved so far in its bid to curb the spread of the coronavirus.
This is because the longer it takes for poor countries to acquire the vaccines they need to achieve herd immunity, the more likely it is that the virus will mutate rendering ineffective the vaccines now in use. A more transmissible variant named Delta is already causing a surge in infections in many countries.
Thus it is an imperative and urgent task that COVID-19 vaccines are made available to everyone, everywhere. To achieve that goal, ""a COVID-19 vaccine must be seen as a global public good, a people's vaccine,"" as Guterres said.
China, as a responsible member of the global village, has already set a good example in this regard.
By promising to make Chinese-made vaccines a global public good, it has provided vaccine assistance to more than 80 developing countries and exported doses to another 40 nations. It is also encouraging cooperation for the localized production of Chinese vaccines in other countries, especially developing ones. For it knows that until poorer countries have access to enough vaccine supplies, the world will not be safe from the coronavirus.
Rich countries should follow suit and immediately start sharing their excess doses with poorer nations to help build a global firewall against the coronavirus. This is not charity, but for their own good.","VIRUSES (99%); VACCINES (97%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); CHARITIES (78%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (78%); GLOBALIZATION (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (78%); POLITICAL & SOCIAL IDEOLOGIES (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); CHARITABLE GIVING (77%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (74%); BIOLOGICS MFG (73%); WEALTHY PEOPLE (73%); UNITED NATIONS (69%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (66%)

Well done, the two Taiwan companies and a charity entity that secured COVID-19 vaccine supplies from the Chinese mainland. And congratulations to the residents of Taiwan, who have received a substantial boost to their difficult fight against the resurging pandemic.
Shame on the Democratic Progressive Party administration which had obstructed the process of cross-Straits vaccine supply out of political calculations and partisan interests; attempting to seek political gains by taking advantage of the pandemic.
Despite all the nasty politics by the DPP, Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Co Ltd, Hon Hai Precision Industry Co Ltd, and Yonglin Charity Foundation have signed a vaccine sales agreement with a subsidiary of the Shanghai-based Fosun Pharmaceutical. Under the agreement, Fosun will provide 10 million doses of an mRNA COVID-19 vaccine to the three Taiwan entities.
According to a joint news release by the three Taiwan entities, they have finalized contract-signing for the purchase as well as paperwork for donating the vaccines to the epidemic prevention authorities in Taiwan. The doses may be shipped to the island as early as the end of September. Fosun has also promised to provide vaccines in accordance with the agreement and normal commercial rules.
As per a March 2020 agreement between Fosun and BioNTech for the research and development of mRNA vaccines, the former holds exclusive commercial rights and interests on the mainland and in Hong Kong, Macao and Taiwan to the COVID-19 vaccine developed by the German company.
It seems a matter of course that Taiwan, as an inseparable part of the country and whose residents are compatriots, should enjoy priority treatment in getting badly needed vaccines from the mainland when the island began to see a new upsurge in infections. The mainland authorities on multiple occasions offered to provide vaccines developed by the Chinese companies Sinovac and Sinopharm to help Taiwan contain the situation. Unfortunately, the DPP administration refused all such offers of help.
The mainland was the first in the world to identify the novel coronavirus, among the first to begin research and production of COVID-19 vaccines. Even if it had any doubts about mainland-developed vaccine doses — which have proved safe and effective in the large-scale inoculation campaign at home and in emergency use in many countries — the DPP administration could still have easily accessed the Pfizer-BioNTech one via Fosun. The company, on its own initiative, had also offered to provide the vaccine following the new outbreak in Taiwan. But the DPP authorities rejected the offer.
Indeed, as some in Taiwan have observed, the just-signed agreement could have been done in October 2020. And had it not been for the three non-governmental institutions fed up with the politicizing and bureaucratic feet-dragging of the DPP administration, it might not have been accomplished even today. People on both sides of the Taiwan Straits have had enough of the DPP's dirty politics.","VACCINES (96%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); AGREEMENTS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PARTISANSHIP (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); BIOLOGICS MFG (89%); CORONAVIRUSES (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY (89%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (89%); VIRUSES (89%); CHARITIES (78%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (78%); ISLANDS & REEFS (76%); ELECTIONS & POLITICS (74%); POLITICAL PARTIES (74%); POLITICS (74%); SENIOR CITIZENS (72%)

Although the sporadic locally transmitted cases appearing each day over the past two weeks might appear inconsequential in comparison to the situation in many other countries, the extreme vigilance the country has exercised toward them explains why it managed to bring the novel coronavirus largely under control last year, even before COVID-19 vaccines became available.
The cluster of infections in Anhui, Liaoning and Guangdong provinces seem to have been effectively checked, and the appearance of these new cases has prompted more people to get vaccinated — more than 10 million doses of vaccines are now administered each day nationwide.
According to the National Health Commission, as of Tuesday, about 530 million doses of vaccines had been administered on the Chinese mainland. It took about 25 days for the number of administered doses of vaccines to increase from 100 million to 200 million, but only seven days for the number to rise from 400 million to 500 million.
If this growth trend can be maintained, the country will be able to have between 900 million and 1 billion people vaccinated by the end of this year, raising its vaccination rate to 70 percent to 80 percent, the level required for herd immunity.
By achieving this goal, China, which has about one-sixth of the world's population, would undoubtedly make another huge contribution to the world's fight against the pandemic.
So far China has produced more than 800 million doses of vaccines — of those 300 million have gone to other countries — and its vaccine output will probably exceed 3 billion by the end of this year. That will lay a solid foundation not only for the country's own vaccination drive but also for it to export and donate more vaccines to other countries.
President Xi Jinping announced at the Global Health Summit last week that as well as providing an additional $3 billion in international aid over the next three years to support the fight against COVID-19 and promote social recovery, China will continue to provide the world with vaccines to the best of its ability. It also supports waiving intellectual property rights on COVID-19 vaccines, and is encouraging Chinese vaccine companies to transfer technologies to other developing countries and carry out joint production with them.
It is therefore almost predictable that China will continue to be the largest supplier of COVID-19 vaccines to the developing and least-developed countries.
With repeated resurgences around the world and frequent mutations, the novel coronavirus is still wreaking havoc. To clinch an early victory against the virus and restore economic growth, all stakeholders should follow China's example of putting people first and looking beyond their own borders so as to ensure a coordinated, systemic and effective response to the pandemic.

With 127 new local cases detected nationwide on Monday, Vice-Premier Sun Chunlan called for swift responses by local governments to contain any local infections. Such a requirement is essential to successfully implement the country's dynamic anti-COVID policy that is characterized by a rapid response to any detected infection, targeted containment of close contacts, and effective treatment of COVID-19 patients to prevent community infections. What has happened in Tianjin, where Sun was carrying out a fact-finding mission from Wednesday to Monday, being a case in point.
The first Omicron infections in the country were detected in the city next to Beijing on Jan 8. Nucleic acid tests were conducted immediately in the areas concerned and the contacts and indirect contacts of those infected were placed under medical observation. In just 10 days, the number of cases had dropped from several dozen a day to 18 on Monday.
It is the timely prevention and control measures that have enabled the country to confine the spread of the virus within a small area every time any infections have been detected. As a result, the wide spread of the virus has been prevented, and therefore the normal running of the economy has been guaranteed and so has normal life for most residents.
With the Lunar New Year only two weeks away, it is of the utmost importance that anti-epidemic authorities at all levels throughout the country are highly alert to ensure that any infections are detected as quickly as possible.
The Spring Festival holiday is an occasion for family reunions. The rapid increase of trips by trains, buses and planes before and after the festival will increase the chances of the virus being spread by people who are infected but show no symptoms and so have no knowledge they are carrying the virus. That explains why Vice-Premier Sun requires local anti-epidemic efforts to expand the scope of screening in key sectors and key sites to ensure the early detection of infections.
It is the country's dynamic prevention and control policy and its strict and effective implementation that have guaranteed the normal running of the economy and kept the disruption of life for residents to the minimum.
It is the success the country has achieved in its response to the COVID-19 pandemic that has made it possible for residents to travel home for Spring Festival family gatherings.
It is all the more important therefore for every individual to treasure what has been achieved against COVID-19 by playing their part. Everyone should strictly observe the prevention and control measures such as wearing masks when in public, washing hands frequently and avoiding gatherings with strangers whenever possible, and adhere to the anti-epidemic requirements.
As far as the defense against the virus is concerned, to err on the side of caution should be the principle for the whole of society.

The ongoing spread of the new Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus worldwide and the rising number of infections should be a reminder of the truth that no country is safe until all countries are safe.
It should also serve as a new clarion call for countries to close the gap in the distribution of vaccines between the developed and developing countries.
The highly transmissible new strain was first identified in South Africa last week and has since spread to Europe, Asia and North America, prompting countries to close their borders and impose travel restrictions. Scientists have long warned that poor countries with low vaccine coverage could become ""a breeding ground"" for new COVID-19 variants. This is because the more the novel coronavirus spreads among an unvaccinated population, the more likely it is to mutate.
Yet despite the warnings, vaccine inequality persists globally. Every day, for every vaccine shot administered as the first dose in the poorest countries, six times as many doses are being administered as third-shot boosters in the richest parts of the world. The result is that only 3 percent of people in low-income countries are fully vaccinated, while the figure exceeds 60 percent in both high-income countries and upper-middle-income countries, former United Kingdom prime minister Gordon Brown, who now serves as the World Health Organization ambassador for global health financing, wrote in a recent article. This has made it virtually impossible for the WHO to achieve its goal of vaccinating 40 percent of the population of every country against COVID-19 by the end of this year.
The response of the United States and other Western countries to the poorer countries' urgent need for vaccines has been disappointing. They have spent the past year hoarding vaccines, buying up enough doses to vaccinate their populations several times over. Around 100 million vaccine doses reportedly will have passed their use-by date at the end of this year.
Even the 1 billion doses of vaccines the G7 leaders promised to donate to low-income countries by the end of this year are yet to be delivered. The US, for example, has reportedly delivered only 25 percent of the vaccines that it promised.

With nearly 110,000 novel coronavirus infections reported each day on average over the past week in the United States, six times that of the same period last year, the once clamorous voices in the country ridiculing China's dynamic clearing policy as inhuman, unscientific and ineffectual have become muted, as it is the US' hands-off approach that fits these charges.
The cumulative number of novel coronavirus infections worldwide has hit 526 million, among which 6.29 million died of COVID-19, as of Tuesday, according to the World Health Organization. And the US, with less than 4 percent of the world's population, accounts for 16.3 percent of the cases and 16.4 percent of the deaths.
That means doing nothing with the excuse that herd immunity has been achieved is tantamount to surrendering the vulnerable, particularly the elderly with underlying diseases, and the low-income groups, to the virus. Which is also evidenced by the data.
These countries would never admit that their current appeasement policy has never been a matter of choice but something they do because of their earlier flawed responses to the virus.
By keeping their economies running at the cost of disadvantaged groups, the only choice they have made as a de facto response to the pandemic so far is to rob the poor and aged to aid the rich.
In contrast, although China's dynamic clearing policy seems to produce many unwelcome side effects, most of which are caused not by the policy itself but by it being carried out inappropriately, it has proved to be the most efficient policy to protect people's lives.
With nearly 20 percent of the world's population, the number of deaths in China attributable to COVID-19 accounts for only 0.08 percent of the world total so far, and its economy is once again running on the right track thanks to the reopening of temporarily locked down cities and the strong, targeted macro-control measures it has been taking.
In doing so, China has made indispensable contributions to the world's fight against the virus and maintaining the stability of the global supply chains.
The difference between the world's top two economies has been shown in their different responses to the pandemic. While the US has chosen to protect the rich and attack China, China has chosen to protect all its people and helped others as the largest source of vaccines to the world.

As President Xi Jinping indicated in his video address at the Global Trade and Investment Promotion Summit last week, the stronger the headwinds are, the more the world needs to pull together.
Greater cooperation and coordination are required to bring an end to the COVID-19 pandemic, reinvigorate trade and investment, unleash the power of innovation in driving development and improve global governance.
Xi called on countries to embrace a global governance vision featuring extensive consultations, joint contributions and shared benefits, and to choose dialogue over confrontation, to tear down walls rather than erect them, pursue integration instead of decoupling, opt for inclusiveness, not exclusion, and adopt the principles of fairness and justice as guides for the reform of the global governance system.
Themed ""History at a turning point: government policies and business strategies"", the World Economic Forum's Annual Meeting 2022 from Sunday to Thursday in Davos, Switzerland, offers those attending the event a chance to act on the pertinence of his call for concerted action.
This is the first time the WEF has hosted an in-person annual meeting in more than two years, due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and the opportunity for face-to-face consensus-building discussions should not be squandered by allowing the internal frictions in a divided system to further complicate the difficulties the world faces.
Although collaboration and coordination remain imperative, they are now happening increasingly in two parallel systems - that of a US-led club and a non-US one.
The challenges are grave and multiplying. As well as the pandemic and its effects, climate change and biodiversity loss are existential threats that can no longer be ignored, the global economic recovery is obviously unstable, uncertain and unbalanced, and debt risks are building up. And those are only a handful of what is a veritable smorgasbord of troubles for attendees at the forum to chew on.
As the world's second-largest economy, the largest trade partner of about 120 countries and regions, the largest manufacturing base and major investor and foreign investment destination, China is doing its best to maintain the stability of the global supply chains and strengthen cooperation between the developed and emerging market economies, and providing necessary assistances to the less developed countries at such a trying moment.
China hopes that all countries will realize that they are in the same boat, and in this period of volatility and transformation will realize it is imperative to join hands and uphold peace, development, cooperation and win-win partnership.

Investigations into the origins of viruses are a complicated scientific issue, and often take years or even decades to complete.
Thus US President Joe Biden's intention was questioned when he gave his intelligence officers, rather than scientists or virologists, the task of determining where the COVID-19 virus had come from, and ordered them to report back in just 90 days.
The loaded way in which Biden has approached this serious scientific issue shows that he doesn't care much about the facts or the truth. He is more interested in giving some substance to the US narrative that blames China for the COVID-19 pandemic.
A two-page summary report of the investigation's ""findings"" was published in August, which China brushed aside as ""not scientifically credible"".
Clearly feeling that the intended message had not got across, the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence offered an updated intelligence briefing on Saturday, in which it asserted that a natural origin and a lab leak were both considered plausible hypotheses for the origin of the novel coronavirus, although it admitted the truth may never be known.
Since the US has been pushing the claim that the virus leaked from a virology laboratory in Wuhan, it was justifiable that China's Foreign Ministry should reject the ""findings"" announced by the US Office of the Director of National Intelligence, with spokesman Wang Wenbin saying that ""a lie repeated a thousand times is still a lie"".
Apart from the lab-leak theory, the intelligence report also accuses China of withholding major data and trying to hinder the global investigation into the origin of the virus.
Which is not true. China has always called for an objective, scientific, and responsible attitude in the tracing of the origins of COVID-19, and cooperated closely with the World Health Organization in this regard. A joint study by China and the WHO published early this year already concluded that it was ""extremely unlikely"" that the novel coronavirus had spread to humans through a laboratory leak. And scientists have not been able to identify any new evidence that might give any credit to the lab-leak hypothesis.
The US blame game against China will only become a joke for the world.
The WHO has launched a new task force, the Scientific Advisory Group on the Origins of Novel Pathogens, comprising 26 global experts, calling it ""the last chance"" to identify the origin of the virus. China has made it clear it will support and participate in this new endeavor.

The leaders of the G7 wealthy nations pledged during their weekend summit in the United Kingdom to share more than 1 billion COVID-19 vaccines with the world's low-income countries over next year.
But given that ""right now, the virus is moving faster than the global vaccine distribution"", as Director-General of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus put it; and that the WHO estimates 11 billion doses are needed if at least 70 percent of the world's population is to be vaccinated by next year to achieve herd immunity against the virus, the group's pledge seems too little.
Not to mention the fact that the imbalance between the G7 and low-income countries in terms of doses administered stands at 73 to 1, according to the World Bank, accentuating the ""moral failure"" of the rich countries to stand by the poorer nations amid this global health crisis.
Since COVID-19 started raging across the world, the way the rich countries have dealt with global vaccine distribution has been egregious. Even UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson admitted during the summit that the ""selfish and nationalistic approaches"" by some countries ""had marred the initial global response to the COVID-19 pandemic"".
As a result, the world is experiencing astonishing vaccine inequality. Of the 1.3 billion vaccines given around the world, only 1 percent has been administered in Africa. While the G7 nations have secured enough vaccines for every one of their citizens to be vaccinated three times over, according to the WHO.
The United States, which has plentiful doses, has an ever-growing surplus of coronavirus vaccines. Millions of Johnson & Johnson vaccines are reportedly set to expire this month.
Moreover, the WHO is still facing a funding gap of $16 billion to speed up production and access to COVID-19 diagnostics, treatment and vaccines. That figure represents less than 1 percent of the annual global defense expenditure, yet this issue went unanswered during the G7 Summit.
All this makes it self-evident that the collective step taken by the G7 to address the urgent need of the developing world for vaccine doses is more symbolic than substantial. As former UK prime minister Gordon Brown said, the summit was ""a missed opportunity"", as more should have been done by the world's most powerful nations in the face of this once-in-a-generation pandemic.
Countries must drop their differences and work together to ensure the global access to vaccines, tests and treatments for everyone who needs them.

To date, the United States has reported more than 35 million cumulative novel coronavirus infections and over 628,000 deaths from COVID-19, leading the world on both counts. The US obviously needs to do some serious soul-searching as to how it has come to this sorry pass.
Ultimately, these figures, the heart-wrenching loss of lives in particular, serve as condemnation of the present and previous administrations' inept responses to the pandemic. Rather than being guided by science and reason, first the Donald Trump administration and now the Joe Biden administration have let political motivations disastrously dictate their responses to this public health threat.
At the beginning of the pandemic last year, the Trump administration chose to ignore the severity of the deadly virus and knowingly downplayed the threat in order to avoid shutting down the economy ahead of the presidential election. As the situation deteriorated, it resorted to spreading conspiracy theories and stigmatizing China as the origin of the virus rather than shouldering its responsibility to follow and implement the scientific advice on how best to contain the virus.
Top US politicians, Trump included, not only called it the ""China virus"" many times but also misled the public by alleging that the epidemic would fade away with the arrival of warmer weather and that if people injected bleach it would kill the virus.
Such rhetoric was symptomatic of the administration's rejection of science and common sense, which led to the attempts to discredit some of the country's leading scientists, including Anthony Fauci, the top US infectious diseases expert, who received death threats for siding with science and the evidence.
After the new administration under Joe Biden took office, the US has accelerated its vaccination program. The high vaccination rate has prompted US states and cities to completely lift COVID-19 prevention and control measures, with the White House even announcing last month that the country is ""closer than ever"" to declaring ""independence"" from the deadly virus.
But the rampancy of the Delta variant across the world and rebounding of COVID-19 cases and deaths in the US all indicate the US has let its guard down too early, as evidenced in Fauci's remark that ""We're going in the wrong direction"" in an interview with CNN last month.
Yet, instead of listening to the scientific advice and responding to the Delta variant in a more effective way, some US politicians have chosen to ignore the tragedy unfolding before their eyes and, worse, are trying to hijack the world's anti-pandemic agenda so they can stage a witch hunt against China.
Apart from hyping the so-called lab-leak conspiracy theory in tracing the origins of the deadly virus and coercing the World Health Organization to conduct a so-called second phase COVID-19 origin-tracing study in China, the White House has even gone to such absurd lengths as to entrust the serious scientific work of virus tracing to its intelligence agencies, which will no doubt further propagate the US' prevailing anti-science sentiments.",EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (90%); VIRUSES (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (89%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); VACCINES (89%); ELECTIONS & POLITICS (88%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012 (88%); DEATH & DYING (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (77%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (77%); SELF HARM (77%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (76%); INTERVIEWS (73%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2008 (73%); CITIES (72%); CONSPIRACY (71%); CONSPIRACY THEORY (71%); ELECTIONS (71%); CAMPAIGNS & ELECTIONS (68%)

In a substantial move toward reopening, the European Union on Thursday officially inaugurated its COVID-19 passport/certificate for citizens and residents of all member countries, as well as for some travelers from third countries. But such a passport/certificate is only available for those vaccinated with EU-approved vaccines.
Although individual member states reportedly have the flexibility to also accept vaccines that have been authorized at the national level or by the World Health Organization, the EU is keeping its doors closed to all those who have been inoculated with vaccines other than the four EU-approved ones, even those that have been approved by the World Health Organization for emergency use.
COVAX, on Thursday urged all regional, national and local government authorities to fully recognize COVID-19 vaccines ""deemed safe and effective by the World Health Organization and/or the 11 Stringent Regulatory Authorities (SRAs) approved for COVID-19 vaccines"".
Partial recognition ""would effectively create a two-tier system, further widening the global vaccine divide and exacerbating the inequities we have already seen in the distribution of COVID-19 vaccines,"" it said.
There may or may not be a political agenda involved. But if this is indeed intended to slam the door shut on Chinese and Russian vaccines, it also excluded those developed by India and the Republic of Korea.
Politicization of vaccines that leads to the differentiated treatment of the vaccines validated by the WHO Emergency Use Listing (EUL) and/or the 11 SRAs will greatly undermine the endeavors of COVAX, impede global vaccination progress, and in turn slow the global recovery.
As WHO director Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus pointed out on Thursday at a news conference, with the highly contagious Delta variant quickly becoming the dominant strain of the novel coronavirus in many countries, ""we are in a very dangerous period of the pandemic"", and ""no country is out of the woods yet"".
With Ghebreyesus' warning the Delta variant has been detected in at least 98 countries, WHO experts noticed that, along with Alpha and Beta, Delta is fuelling an aggressive third wave across Africa.
Openly discriminating against those who use vaccines other than those it gives the green light to, is morally problematic. Many of those inoculated with non-EU-approved vaccines simply had no access to those approved by the EU. It is also politically unsound. It will certainly acerbate the political divide some are trying to create using the pandemic, and do greater damage to global public health in the long term. And the EU practice is professionally unsound as the WHO/SRAs' approvals were based on serious, meticulous scientific scrutiny.
It merits a special mention that, as the Chinese Foreign Ministry said, China has provided vaccines to nearly 100 countries, covering a considerable portion of the global population, and there is no credible proof the vaccines they endorsed are unsafe or ineffective.",VACCINES (97%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (90%); EUROPEAN UNION (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (90%); IMMUNITY CERTIFICATIONS & PASSPORTS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (90%); APPROVALS (89%); DISCRIMINATION (89%); DRUG & MEDICAL DEVICES APPROVAL (89%); EPIDEMICS (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (88%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); VACCINE CERTIFICATIONS & PASSPORTS (78%); PRESS CONFERENCES (73%); VIRUSES (73%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (70%); CORONAVIRUSES (69%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (67%)

When COVID-19 vaccines were still being developed, Western media said that China lagged behind in the ""vaccine race"" and cast doubts on when, even whether, China would be able to produce them.
Now that China has approved its first vaccine for general use, with others on the way, Western media have tried to cast doubts on their safety. That was rebutted by Zeng Yixin, deputy head of China's National Health Commission, at a news conference on Jan 9. He said that more than 7.5 million doses of the vaccine had been administered to ""key groups"" since Dec 15, in addition to the 1.6 million doses that had been administered to ""high-risk groups"" by the end of November, and fewer than 0.1 percent of those inoculated developed a light fever, and about two people per million developed an adverse response such as an allergic reaction.
Chinese COVID-19 vaccines are a good public product and have been welcomed by countries around the world. Indonesia will reportedly commence a mass inoculation program using a vaccine produced by the Chinese manufacturer Sinovac Biotech on Wednesday, with President Joko Widodo the first to be vaccinated.
Thailand has also announced it is buying 2 million doses of the vaccine, which is known as CoronaVac, with the first batch due to arrive in the country by the end of February.
Morocco has reportedly ordered 10 million doses of the Sinopharm vaccine, and Minister of Health Khalid Ait Taleb reported ""very positive"" results from clinical trials of the vaccine on Moroccan volunteers even before it was put on the market in China. Similar clinical trials in Turkey have also shown very good results.
The efficacy and safety of the Chinese vaccines have been demonstrated through such trials. About 4.5 million people, including volunteers from 128 countries, have received injections of COVID-19 vaccines made in China. None of them has suffered any severe adverse reaction.
Last but no less important, Chinese-made vaccines are relatively inexpensive and easy to transport without requiring very low temperatures. Wherever ice cream can arrive, the Chinese vaccines can also arrive.
Moreover, China joined COVAX, a global alliance backed by the World Health Organization that aims to ensure the world's poorest countries have access to COVID-19 vaccines, in October 2020. China has signed agreements with many countries to provide materials for them, so that these countries can produce the vaccines domestically.
China is rendering the greatest efforts to help ensure countries have access to COVID-19 vaccines, and it is always open to international cooperation.

The Washington National Cathedral rang its mourning bell 1,000 times on Monday last week, once for every 1,000 deaths from COVID-19 in the United States. That is the highest number of deaths in the world, while the total number of infections in the country exceeds 80 million, which is also the highest number worldwide. These stark and sad statistics shame the US, as it boasts the strongest medical resources in the world, as well as the most advanced technology in medical science.
With its medical resources and ample supplies of other resources, the US response to the pandemic should have been much better. Even after its failure to realize the severity of the threat, the US government had more than one opportunity to adjust its anti-COVID policies, which could have reduced the death toll by a large margin.
As early as April 2020, 2,500 daily deaths were reported and the surge of the Delta variant caused more than 100,000 deaths in September and October 2021. The number of deaths could have been reduced had the US government adjusted its prevention and control policies at these junctures.
The pandemic in the US has been handled by two administrations, a Republican one under Donald Trump and the current Democratic one under Joe Biden. Both administrations have been too preoccupied with the political struggle between the two parties to lend enough thought to the fight against the pandemic.
The bipartisan strife in Washington has obviously prevented either administration from taking effective action to combat the virus. Even the allocation of the money needed to respond to the virus has not been approved by Congress because of the partisan wrangling.
Instead of regarding the virus as the common enemy of humanity, which requires the concerted efforts of all countries in winning the battle against it, Washington has politicized the virus.
As a result, the public in the US has been misled.
President Joe Biden officially announced that the US had reached the ""tragic milestone"" of 1 million deaths on Thursday, and the same day he co-hosted the second Global COVID-19 Summit with the leaders of Belize, Germany, Indonesia and Senegal. With the summit, Washington sought to portray itself as a leader in the global fight against the pandemic, but that is belied by its failed response to the pandemic. Washington has also failed to act as a world leader for the global fight against the virus, which has resulted in the resurgences of the pandemic in various parts of the world.
It is not just people in the US, but people around the world who are paying the price for degeneracy of the US' political system. The dysfunctional US system means that political point scoring comes before people's well-being.
The doleful milestone of 1 million deaths from the pandemic should give the American people food for thought about the state of the US political system.",

The country's daily caseload of novel coronavirus infections has hovered above 1,000 for four consecutive days, with 1,860 new local symptomatic cases announced on Tuesday.
Negligible as this may be compared with corresponding figures overseas, this highlights the rapid resurgence of the virus, with 5,081 confirmed locally transmitted cases announced on Monday, a record daily high over the past two years. And this wave of the virus has swept into 28 provincial-level regions with a total of 18,000 locally transmitted cases detected between March 1 and March 15.
This has prompted increasing calls for re-evaluating the present pandemic control regime as worries mount over whether the country's economy can afford to sustain the current approach that aims to curb community spread as quickly as possible once any infections appear.
Recognizing that the nature of the pandemic has changed, the authorities have responded. Given the rapidly growing number of daily infections because of the highly contagious nature of the Omicron variants but also their tendency for reduced lethality, the ninth edition of the country's COVID-19 diagnosis and treatment protocol, released by the National Health Commission on Tuesday, has many updates to the COVID-19 testing, management and treatment regime.
Besides optimizing procedures for the detection and reporting of infections, the most significant change is ""by-category"" management. Considering that most people infected with the Omicron variants show either slight or no symptoms at all, and thus need no treatment, those with minor symptoms will be put under medical quarantine, instead of being hospitalized.
The authorities' decision to stick to the dynamic clearing strategy while adjusting corresponding tactics in its implementation is a sign of both the responsiveness of the authorities to the changing characteristics of the epidemic but also their confidence that the Omicron variants are controllable and that the dynamic clearing approach is still the most effective way to contain the virus.
There is no doubt about the government's resolve and capability for mobilization, nor the public's willingness to cooperate. But earlier, faster, and better implementation of pandemic responses are needed to reduce the disruptions to the normal lives of ordinary people, as well as economic activities.
There is also much work that needs to be done to increase vaccination rates and accelerate the development of vaccines and medicines so the country can seize the initiative in its fight against the virus. Once it has that, the country can gradually relax its policies.",CORONAVIRUSES (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); VIRUSES (90%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); ISOLATION & QUARANTINE (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); VACCINES (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (73%); BUSINESS NEWS (69%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (69%); ECONOMICS (68%); DRUG DESIGN & DISCOVERY (60%)

At the virtually-held 28th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation Economic Leaders' Meeting on Saturday, leaders launched the Aotearoa (New Zealand) Plan of Action toward achieving the Putrajaya Vision 2040 for future cooperation in the Asia-Pacific region.
The APEC Putrajaya Vision 2040, adopted by the APEC leaders last year, set a new mission: to build ""an open, dynamic, resilient and peaceful Asia-Pacific community by 2040, for the prosperity of all our people and future generations"". Building on APEC's founding documents, including the 1994 Bogor Goals and the 1995 Osaka Action Agenda, the plan to achieve that vision calls for individual and collective actions based on the three economic drivers of trade and investment; innovation and digitalization; and strong, balanced, secure, sustainable and inclusive growth.
Such a consensus is badly needed at a time when the world is still battling the COVID-19 pandemic and trying to spur an economic recovery.
In a joint declaration, the APEC economic leaders vowed to continue to support global efforts to share vaccines equitably and expand vaccine manufacture and supply through such measures as voluntary transfer of vaccine production and technologies and voluntary reduction of the cost of COVID-19 vaccines and related medical goods.
Their commitment to closer cooperation in this regard sets a good example.
The APEC economies also support the rules-based multilateral trading system, with the World Trade Organization at its core, and pledged to advance economic integration in the region so as to drive the wheels of the global economic recovery.
Home to around 3 billion people and representing about half of global trade and 60 percent of the world's total GDP, APEC economies can inject fresh impetus into a global economic recovery by accelerating the region's economic integration.
As an APEC member, China has always supported regional integration and it is playing an irreplaceable role in promoting regional economic growth as well as the fight against the pandemic.
In the speech he delivered at the meeting via video link, President Xi Jinping emphasized the need to broaden economic cooperation across the Asia-Pacific, and reaffirmed China's commitment to promoting innovation-driven growth, greater connectivity and mutually beneficial cooperation in the region.
Calling openness ""the lifeline of Asia-Pacific cooperation"", he urged APEC members to uphold open regionalism, follow the guidance of the APEC Vision 2040 in advancing regional economic integration, and work for the early realization of a high-standard Free Trade Area of the Asia-Pacific.
Welcoming APEC initiatives to facilitate the flow of essential goods and people in a safe manner, Xi said that China will continue to provide support to the Sub-Fund for APEC Cooperation on Combating COVID-19 and Economic Recovery with a view to helping member economies recover and grow their economies.
It is through such practical measures that the APEC economies can inject new dynamism into the development and prosperity of the region, which is the most dynamic and promising economic powerhouse globally.",INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (91%); VACCINES (91%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (90%); ECONOMIC POLICY (90%); BUSINESS NEWS (89%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (89%); ECONOMIC RECOVERY (89%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (89%); EMERGING MARKETS (89%); TALKS & MEETINGS (89%); INTERNATIONAL TRADE (87%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (78%); GLOBALIZATION (78%); GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (78%); TRADE TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (77%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (71%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (71%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (71%); PANDEMICS (71%); BIOLOGICS MFG (70%)

US President Joe Biden recently ordered intelligence officials to conduct an intensive 90-day probe to reinvestigate the possibility of the origin of the COVID-19 pandemic being a leak from a laboratory. The real purpose of the probe is to stigmatize China and pin the blame for the novel coronavirus outbreak on China's virology lab in Wuhan.
It is absurd that the US intelligence community, which concocted the ""weapons of mass destruction"" ploy to justify the invasion of Iraq, should be entrusted with this task.
It is a politically motivated move that will only further disrupt international cooperation in the global fight against the novel coronavirus.
We do not need an expert on infectious diseases to tell us that even though China was the first country to report the outbreak to the World Health Organization, that does not necessarily mean the virus originated in China. Not to mention that Washington's move came just after The Wall Street Journal published a report fanning the speculation that the coronavirus might have leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology ahead of US President Joe Biden's trip to Europe, where he hopes to rally support for US efforts to contain China. Even the WSJ report mentioned that there wasn't any evidence to support the lab-leak theory; and the possibility has been dismissed by the WHO.
In a research report presenting the findings of a team of experts that conducted a field study in Wuhan, the WHO concluded that a leak from the Chinese laboratory was ""extremely unlikely"" and the virus was probably transmitted to humans from animals.
By ordering the probe, Biden has openly denied the conclusion of the WHO experts and resurrected the baseless ""Chinese virus"" smear initiated by his predecessor.
Given the complexity and importance of the issue of novel coronavirus origin tracing, the world should not tolerate the ill-motivated assumptions, fallacies and distortions of the facts and smearing of China's cooperation with the WHO.
Especially since it has been reported that some people in the United States, Spain, France, Italy and Brazil, and many other countries showed signs of the virus and infections long before the outbreak was identified in China at the end of December.
According to a US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention report, COVID-19 antibodies were detected in blood donations collected in December 2019. This means that the virus may have already been spreading in the US by then.
Questions are also being raised regarding links between the US military biochemical research base at Fort Detrick and the COVID-19 pandemic.
The attempts to stigmatize China by politicians trying to shift the blame for the mess their countries find themselves in will only damage global solidarity in the fight against the virus and hinder scientific efforts to determine its origin, which could help to prevent a future pandemic.
Given the magnitude of this global health crisis, it is a shared responsibility of all countries to act in an objective, science-based and cooperative manner.","VIRUSES (94%); CORONAVIRUSES (92%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); MICROBIOLOGY (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (90%); US PRESIDENTS (90%); VIROLOGY (90%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (89%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (89%); INTELLIGENCE SERVICES (78%); RECRUITMENT & HIRING (78%); REPORTS, REVIEWS & SECTIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (76%); BLOOD BANKS (72%); WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION (72%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (71%); BIOCHEMICAL RESEARCH (70%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (69%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (68%); RESEARCH REPORTS (66%); BLOOD DONATIONS (60%); BUSINESS REPORTS & FORECASTS (58%)

The worsening pandemic situation in India — with its daily COVID-19 infections around 400,000 over the past week — as well as in some of its neighboring countries such as Nepal which also saw a fast increase in cases, has raised the alarm for China to exercise the utmost vigilance against possible imported cases.
Making the task especially challenging is the fact that the variant blamed for the massive resurgence of the novel coronavirus in India is highly transmissible. Any letup in vigilance against this invisible enemy of humanity may have devastating consequences. This is a bitter lesson many countries have already learned since the virus first struck.
China has so far done an excellent job in its prevention and control work, with zero local infections reported for more than a month. The past May Day holiday, which saw around 230 million trips recorded nationwide, has further proved that efforts to keep COVID-19 at bay — including the wearing of face masks, social distancing and capacity controls at tourist or cultural sites — have been effective.
The ""separation line"" atop Mount Qomolangma that China announced on Monday, to prevent the coronavirus from being spread by climbers ascending Nepal's side of the mountain, is an indication of the wariness of health officials and their preparedness to update the prevention measures to deal with any new situation that emerges.
Yet what China has achieved should by no means provide reason for complacency, given the extremely complex pandemic situation and that many of the countries now struggling to control the virus are China's neighbors.
No final victory will be achieved until all countries have gained the upper hand over the virus.
China knows that in the face of the pandemic no country is an island, and helping other countries to overcome their difficulties is also helping itself. It is doing all it can to help India fight the virus, by offering medical supplies in a timely manner, and it is providing assistance for many other countries by making its vaccines a public good.
The most effective weapons against the virus are the various vaccines that have been developed. Fortunately, as Maria Van Kerkhove, WHO's technical lead on COVID-19, has said, there is nothing to suggest that the vaccines that have been developed are not effective against the new variants.
Which is why China is racing against time to vaccinate at least 70 percent of its 1.4 billion population in order to achieve herd immunity. So far more than 300 million Chinese have received at least their first jabs, and with a rising sense of urgency the country is pushing ahead with the national vaccination program so as to better position itself to meet any new emergencies.
At the same time, upholding its vision of building a global community of health for all, China will continue its efforts to make its COVID-19 vaccines a public good and provide whatever help it can to countries in need.",CORONAVIRUSES (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); IMPORT TRADE (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); VACCINES (89%); VIRUSES (88%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (77%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (77%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (77%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (77%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (72%); CLIMBING (69%)

Does China's dynamic clearing policy against the novel coronavirus pose a threat to the global supply chains? Some foreign media say so. Such a claim is as preposterous as saying that the spread of the virus has actually promoted the growth of the global economy.
The absurdity of such remarks lies in the fact that those who make them have turned a blind eye to what China has contributed to not only the growth of the global economy but also to the global fight against the pandemic. It is the dynamic clearing policy that made it possible for China to generally control the virus the earliest among countries, enabling it to resume its economic activities, and then keep the transmission of the virus localized whenever a cluster of infections have appeared.
The global supply chains would have collapsed had it not been for the support of the robust growth of China's economy when the other major economies were devastated by the COVID-19 pandemic in the past two years. Had it not been for China's provision of the necessary materials for the global control and prevention of the virus' transmission, more people would have been killed by the virus and the consequences of the pandemic would have been much more serious globally.
It must be what has happened in Shanghai that has led to their making such remarks. But what they cannot understand is the fact that the measures, whether the lockdown of communities or the organized nucleic acid tests for residents, are adopted to cut off the transmission of the virus in a timely manner. The temporary suspension of some economic activities in the city is meant to preempt the long-lasting negative impact the economy will suffer if the pandemic situation worsens.
If they look objectively at China's response to the COVID-19 pandemic with a long-term perspective, they will undoubtedly arrive at a different conclusion. Looking at what has happened to the global supply chains and ever worsening inflation from a global perspective, it is not difficult to see that many factors besides the pandemic have resulted in the crisis.
The unilateralism and trade protectionism the United States has initiated and advocated have dealt a heavy blow to the smooth running of the global supply chains. And its quantitative easing is the source of the extensive global inflation.
Meanwhile, the conflict between Russia and Ukraine has caused and will further lead to a series of problems for the development of the global economy and even for the food security of some countries.
China's dynamic clearing approach to curb the spread of the virus as quickly as possible will only help the country to maintain the steady growth of its economy, which will help cushion the impacts of these various negative factors on the global economy.",

The COVID-19 pandemic's blow to the Chinese economy has been severe, as evidenced in the worse-than-expected economic figures in November. Trade in goods increased by only 0.1 percent compared with the same period last year. And retail sales, a key measure of consumer spending, were down 5.9 percent last month year-on-year, a major decline compared with the 0.5 percent drop in October. Meanwhile, the surveyed urban jobless rate increased to 5.7 percent from 5.5 percent in October.
But with the introduction of the optimized prevention and control measures, removing the uncertainties caused by lockdowns, production suspension and logistic disruptions to the economy over the past three years, it is anticipated that the most difficult period for the economy has passed.
Now with the flows of production factors gradually becoming smooth, and socioeconomic activities picking up steam, the huge potential of the Chinese market will be further released, and the economy is expected to be revitalized in the days to come. One of the brightest spots in China's economic development is investment in the high-tech sector, which climbed by 19.9 percent in the first 11 months of the year, as compared with a 5.3 percent increase in China's total fixed-asset investment over the same period.
Moreover, the total added value of high-tech manufacturing surged 8 percent compared with the same period a year ago, with the output of such products as new-energy vehicles and solar cells increasing by 100.5 percent and 44.1 percent, respectively. The industrial restructuring and upgrading will continue to provide added momentum to China's high-quality development, which in a way also demonstrates the resilience of the economy.
The promising prospects have prompted many international financial service agencies to upgrade the outlook for China's economy in 2023. Morgan Stanley, for example, raised its forecast for the country's gross domestic product next year to 5.4 percent from 5 percent previously, as the company expects the ""faster and sharper rise in mobility"" to be reflected in the economy starting in the second quarter.
The International Monetary Fund has also forecast that China's growth will accelerate to 4.4 percent next year, as compared with a meager 1 percent growth for the United States, and just 0.5 percent growth for the eurozone. All this indicates that China will continue to be the major countercyclical stabilizer of the global economy.
Looking forward, the government will step up efforts to ensure steady growth and spur market vitality to promote the overall improvement of economic operation next year. 2022 was undoubtedly a challenging year for China's economy, but the country withstood the test and confidence is high that the prospects are immeasurably brighter for 2023.","ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (91%); ECONOMIC NEWS (90%); BUSINESS NEWS (89%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (89%); STATISTICS (89%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (78%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (78%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (78%); GLOBALIZATION (78%); GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (78%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (78%); OUTPUT & DEMAND (78%); EURO ZONE (73%); INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND (73%); UNEMPLOYMENT RATES (73%); RETAIL SALES (72%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (71%); QUALITY CONTROL (62%); MONETARY UNIONS (60%)

The claims of some Western media that China's adjustment of its COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control policy equals ""inaction"" do not hold water at all.
There is no doubt that China has tried its best to cushion the shocks coming from the wave of mass infections - which no country has escaped or can avoid - and has minimized their influence on the recovery of socioeconomic activities.
Indeed, the government's to-do list is even longer than before. Since it is prioritizing the most vulnerable who become infected - that is mainly the elderly with underlying health conditions - it has to ensure care is delivered in a more targeted and prompt way.
China has more than 240 million people aged 60 and above, larger than that of all developed economies combined. Although the vaccination rate of this group has reached about 90 percent, one of the highest in the world, that means there are still about 25 million people in this vulnerable group who remain unvaccinated against the virus.
That medical care and supplies, especially intensive medical care, have been unable to keep pace with the demand, within a short time, has been inevitable given the contagiousness of the dominant virus variants and the fact that the medical staff have unavoidably borne the brunt of the virus in the first wave of infections thanks to the nature of their jobs.
Yet despite this, public health institutions have sustained their operation during the most difficult time over the past three weeks, and the capacity of the intensive medical care in many cities has expanded rapidly thanks to the governments' huge input.
As of last weekend, the shortage of medical care resources began being eased with the remarkable increase of sickbeds, more medical staff resuming their duties after recovery and the gradual decline of infections.
That is something hard to come by were it not for the close coordination among the government, public health agencies and society, the dedication of medical workers and couriers to doing their jobs, and the stepped-up operation of all pharmaceutical companies and enterprises producing essential medical supplies and life necessities.
All these efforts have been necessary for the nation to cope with this wave and will ensure it is better able to ride out future waves of the virus.
Given all this, the adjustment of the virus control measures came at the right time, as it not only sets the stage for the take-off of the economy after a short period of shocks, but also enables the country to concentrate its limited medical care resources on caring for the most vulnerable among its huge population.
Shame on those trying to belittle and slander the nation's efforts. Whatever they may claim to the contrary, the most populous country in the world has never stopped doing all it can to save lives.

Some countries seem to regard the COVID-19 vaccines as a panacea, that they will be a once-and-for-all solution that liberates their economies and societies from the quagmire of the pandemic. But the tightening epidemic control measures in six regions in China, where sporadic local infections have been found this month, and the normalized pandemic control endeavors in the rest of the country indicate China is not putting all its eggs in the vaccine basket.
With 600 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines set to be produced by the end of this year, and even more in the next few months, the most in the world, China has the capacity to organize a nationwide inoculation program. However, for China, the vaccines are extra insurance, not a magic bullet. Instead of pinning all its hopes on the vaccines, the country has been trying to instill a sense of urgency throughout its pandemic-control system, knowing that before the virus disappears from its last foothold in the world, the nation must continue to carry out the pandemic control measures that have proved effective in containing the novel coronavirus in the country.
That explains why China has kept its quarantine hospitals, stock of essential medical supplies and medical staff in a battle-ready state, and all grassroots pandemic-control task forces remain on high alert.
It is these precautions, along with early detection, early tracing, early quarantining and early treatment that will extinguish any flare-ups in infections as has been shown over the past few months since the virus was generally brought under control in the country in March.
In other words, if countries relax their vigilance thinking the worst is over because the long-awaited vaccines are now arriving, they are likely to be in for a rude awakening.
Since China initiated the emergency use of its COVID-19 vaccines on July 22, tens of thousands of people working in the customs, medical facilities, airports, and other key posts that might put them at higher risk of being infected with the virus, have been inoculated. And the future vaccination process will also be carried out in a step-by-step manner, as the most vulnerable groups will be inoculated first.
That means China－which has pledged to make its COVID-19 vaccines international public goods－can set aside a large proportion of its vaccine production to help those countries in need that might find it difficult to purchase vaccines from developed countries. Many countries from Asia, Africa, Europe and South America are already on the waiting list for Chinese vaccines.
This world-first approach has driven home the fact that China, unlike some countries, recognizes that providing vaccines to the world is a responsibility to be shouldered rather than a privilege it can speculate on for its own ends. It will continue to do all it can to help the world weather the storm.
Large-scale inoculation against the virus represents a big step forward in the world's battle against the common enemy.

In groundlessly accusing China of carrying out ""genocide and crimes against humanity"" in its Xinjiang Uygur autonomous region in a speech on Monday, and by announcing new visa restrictions on Chinese officials for repressing ethnic and religious minorities both within and outside China on the same day, US Secretary of State Antony Blinken once again laid bare the United States' hypocrisy on human rights.
If not for the earnestness with which US President Joe Biden claimed to want to bring Sino-US relations back to the right track in his video call with President Xi Jinping on Friday, Blinken's remarks could have been regarded as run-of-the-mill given the current frosty relations between Washington and Beijing and the disinformation campaign the US is waging against China.
Blinken's call for China to ""end its ongoing genocide and crimes against humanity"" in Xinjiang was nothing new in the systematic smear campaign Washington is carrying out against China with the help of various think tanks, human rights organizations and the Xinjiang secessionists it has on its payroll.
And this is just one part of it disinformation campaign that includes scapegoating China for the COVID-19 pandemic, smearing China for ""conniving with and supporting"" Russia's ""invasion"" of Ukraine, and demonizing China as a ""debt trap layer"" for African and Pacific island countries, an intimidator of its small neighbors and a spier via technology.
Instead, by shamelessly negating on the I-want-to-mend-the-fence statements Biden made, Blinken called into question the possibility of any improvement of ties under the current US administration.
Although the Chinese Foreign Ministry's response to Blinken's speech and the new sanctions announced may also seem routine given what has transpired in the past, Blinken's words have merely reinforced Beijing's conviction that the Biden administration's hypocrisy is incorrigible and it will forever say one thing while doing another.
When Blinken claimed, ""Perpetrators of human rights abuses must continue to face consequences"", he casually ignored the ongoing humanitarian crisis in Ukraine which the US has engineered, neglected to mention the nearly 1 million COVID-19 deaths on US soil because of the political power games in Washington, and disregarded the humanitarian crises the US has caused in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and other countries with its interventions.
In their substantive talk on Friday, the two leaders discussed the importance of managing competition between the two countries and maintaining open lines of communication. But such communication should not be just empty words or chicken-and-duck exchanges.
If the Biden administration really wants to mend the US' relations with China, it should first mend its ways and demonstrate that when it talks, it is doing so with sincerity.",

Disparate access to vaccines is leading to the creation of two classes of countries, the haves and havenots. Countries with wealth or the capacity to make vaccines against the novel coronavirus are in a place that's very different from those without.
Unfortunately for the world, life will not really return to a pre-pandemic normal until the virus is controlled pretty much everywhere. And that will require protection on a global scale. The fastest and least painful way to achieve this level of protection is vaccines.
Global immunization campaigns to protect against diseases on a global scale have taken decades. Over time, they are quite doable. The challenge now is that time is an issue. The cost of keeping borders shut, restaurants closed, tourism industries crippled and hospitals full for another month or year is prohibitive and translates directly into higher poverty rates and human suffering.
But knowing what has to be done is one thing. Knowing how to do it is another.
The sheer speed at which companies developed vaccines to protect against COVID-19 has been nothing short of miraculous. The challenge is to make and distribute billions of doses－tens of billions－to reach everyone.
What is required is for vaccines to be made in more places. Higher-income countries or countries with vaccine manufacturing capacity－like China, India and Brazil－are making them fast, but not fast enough.
Nations like the United States, Canada and the United Kingdom have given first shots or fully vaccinated around half (or more) of their populations. China, administering millions of doses to its citizens, has sent millions more to other countries.
But other places, from Argentina to Kenya, from Thailand to South Africa, are moving nowhere near as fast. So the calls for vaccines to be made more widely available are getting some attention.
The announcement in early May that the US government was considering waiving patents for COVID-19 vaccines generated vigorous, if somewhat meaningless, debate.
Companies have invested billions in developing vaccines and patenting the technologies used to develop them. Patents allow companies to protect their investments.
However, to be clear, waiving patents for badly needed COVID-19 vaccines or drugs is not likely to bring down pharmaceutical companies; nor will it destroy innovation. In the mid-1990s, patent waivers were issued for HIV/AIDS drug cocktails, and the ultimate impact was a good one for everyone. HIV/AIDS was brought broadly under control. But it took time, and time now is short.
Part of the truth is, even if the US or other rich nations were to forcibly waive patents for COVID-19 vaccines, poorer nations with no vaccine manufacturing capacity would see virtually little immediate benefit.
Making vaccines is not easy. They have to be made in controlled facilities that require a lot of technology that is not available everywhere. Even with a patent waiver, many countries will not be able to produce vaccines.
Even with a patent waiver, it could take years for some countries to put in place the capacity to manufacture vaccines.
What poorer nations need is not patent waivers but the ability to manufacture vaccines at scale. They need the technology to manufacture vaccines, and not just traditional inactivated virus vaccines but also the relatively new (and harder to make) mRNA vaccines.
The good news is that these transfers are already happening in pockets.
Chinese companies Sinovac Biotech and CanSino Biologics are considering technology transfers. Yin Weidong, Sinovac's CEO, has said the company will try to sort out technology transfers to 10 different countries. CanSino CEO Yu Xuefeng said the company is considering technology transfers to places like Mexico and Pakistan.
Elsewhere, AstraZeneca is working with the Serum Institute of India to make its vaccine en masse, and is working on technology transfer agreements with the Oswaldo Cruz Foundation in Brazil.
A lot more such transfers are needed, and fast.
To speed up the production of vaccines, companies should be given incentives to transfer their technology. If the threat of waiving patents can speed up such transfers, then great, but just waiving patents is not necessarily a useful goal in itself.

Foreign companies will see new growth opportunities in China as the country deepens global ties under the dual-circulation development pattern, leaders from multinationals said on Thursday.
""The dual-circulation pattern offers new opportunities for the cooperation between foreign and Chinese companies, especially in overseas markets,"" said Jerry Guo, vice-president of Qualcomm China for government affairs.
For example, Chinese smart phone producers who have taken the lead in the domestic market are increasingly placing their strategic focus on exploring overseas markets, he said.
Qualcomm, the US-based wireless technology company, will step up efforts to facilitate this process, by virtue of its advanced technology and global partnership network, Guo said.
Guo said at the release of the book MNCs' Actions in Fighting COVID-19 Together with China in Beijing on Thursday, amid the country's efforts to build a ""dual-circulation"" new development pattern.
China will nurture a strong domestic market and establish a new development pattern, according to the statement released on Thursday after the Fifth Plenary Session of the 19th Central Committee of the Communist Party of China.
The country will smooth domestic circulation and let domestic and international circulations reinforce each other, spurring consumption in an all-round way and expanding investment, said the statement.
Despite an emphasis on the domestic market, the pattern entails strengthening cooperation with multinationals to make the economy deeply blended with international economic exchanges and achieve mutual benefits, experts said.
Wu Jing, vice-president of UPS China's public affairs, said China's commitment to building a modern logistics system, as a key support for the dual-circulation pattern, has brought new development opportunities for delivery multinationals like UPS.
The US package delivery company will enhance cooperation with Chinese partners to not only help upgrade the country's logistics system, but promote the development of cross-border e-commerce and the global recovery from the COVID-19 pandemic, Wu said at the book release.
The book, both in Chinese and English, compiles dozens of multinationals' actions of fulfilling social responsibility and making contributions to China's fight against the COVID-19 outbreak, as well as their proposals and thoughts on dealing with the profound changes brought by the pandemic.
The China International Council for the Promotion of Multinational Corporations handled the editorial side of the book, while the Social Sciences Academic Press (China) was the publisher.
Despite negative impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, Guo said he remains confident in the Chinese market, with the emerging 5G applications that have sped up development amid the pandemic to help counter the economic losses to a large extent.
Five areas of 5G applications may see the biggest growth potential in China, namely industrial internet, healthcare, new forms of commerce, pan-entertainment, and distance education and teleworking, Guo said.

In 2022, it witnessed an arduous battle with the novel coronavirus and the attendant efforts to maintain the world's second-largest economy on the right track.
Since COVID-19 struck, China has put the people first and put life first all along. Following a science-based and targeted approach, it has adapted its COVID response in light of the evolving situation.
The Chinese economy has remained the second largest in the world and enjoyed sound development. China's GDP for the whole year is expected to exceed 120 trillion yuan ($17.4 trillion).
The year ahead, as President Xi Jinping said in his New Year address, will see the country demonstrate its strong resilience, tremendous potential and great vitality and consolidate its good long-term fundamentals.
The effects of the challenges of 2022 will continue to be felt in 2023, calling for good governance and risk management not only on the part of China, but all countries.
That's why President Xi calls on the whole nation to ""charge at the toughest and aim at the farthest"". It means, as he said, to take on the biggest challenges and go after the most ambitious goals.
Long as the journey is, China will reach its destination if it stays the course; difficult as the task is, it will get the job done if it keeps working at it. As long as the nation has the resolve to move mountains and the perseverance to plod on, as long as we keep its feet on the ground and forge ahead with its journey by making steady progress, it will turn its grand goals into reality.
The challenges has only served to make the people realize what is the most important and what should be stuck to, and it has strengthened the country's resolve to always stand on the right side of history, as the 20th National Congress of the Communist Party of China, held in October, made clear.
An ambitious blueprint has been drawn for building a modern socialist country in all respects and advancing the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation on all fronts through a Chinese path to modernization, sounding a clarion call of the times for us forging ahead on a new journey.
As the past year has highlighted, numerous touching stories of people sticking together in face of adversity or even sacrificing their lives to help others in distress, there are always some backstage heroes, such as medical workers and couriers, who through their own actions instill in people hope of better times ahead even in desperate situations.
Likewise, there are always countries, such as China, that are stalwart upholders of peace and stability, and who stand up for the interests of those being bullied and exploited.
As President Xi said, the pandemic will ease, the global upheaval will calm down. But the unyielding struggle of the Chinese people and the Chinese nation will continue, and the country will continue to undauntedly face the biggest challenges head on and pursue its ambitious goals.",INFECTIOUS DISEASE (89%); COMMUNISM (79%); CORONAVIRUSES (77%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (77%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (77%); SOCIALISM (77%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (72%); VIRUSES (72%); POLITICAL PARTIES (60%); RISK MANAGEMENT (52%)

Books and activities related to the epidemic were a major highlight at this year's Shanghai Book Fair, which concluded on Tuesday.
Among those that displayed such books was China International Publishing Group, which had a collection of books on international cooperation against COVID-19.

One title that caught the attention of readers was China, We Got Your Back, which tells the story of a group of foreigners who overcame difficulties in purchasing medical supplies and sending them to Huanggang, Hubei province, in the early days of the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The book was written by Raz Galor, an Israeli who graduated from Peking University in 2018 and who helped coordinate relief efforts with other foreigners who'd previously studied in China.
The Chinese version of the book was published by New Star Press, a subsidiary of China International Publishing Group, while the Hebrew version was published by Sella Meir Publishing House.
China, We Stand with You is another book in the same series by New Star Press. This book features the stories of 35 foreign experts who stayed or returned to China to help during the initial stages of the epidemic. An English version of the book was published by Alpha Science International.
Meanwhile, the Japanese version of Manual on Prevention and Control of COVID-19, which was edited by Chinese infectious disease doctor Zhang Wenhong, was also published at the fair alongside 20 other books related to the fight against the epidemic.
""We hope to bring the knowledge and experience about the Chinese fight against the epidemic to our readers through this book fair,"" says Huang Wei, director of the editorial office of the China Foreign Languages Publishing Administration.
Another book, The Path of Our Couriers, shone the spotlight on couriers who continued to work during the novel coronavirus outbreak. Launched by YTO Express and Shanghai People's Publishing House, the book features more than 80 stories and over 120 pictures that vividly depict the lives of these professionals who contributed to the fight against the viral outbreak.
""Express courier services have become an integral part of our daily lives, and they have been particularly valuable during COVID-19. Shanghai People's Publishing House decided to collaborate with YTO Express to publish this book as our way of showing respect to every person involved in this profession,"" says He Yuanlong, deputy Party secretary of the publishing house.
""This book is a tribute to the efforts of these couriers. Because of their courage and contribution, the country's economic and social activities have been well-maintained,"" says Yu Hongwei, deputy head of the Shanghai Municipal Postal Administration.
China's express delivery business grew significantly this year. More than 40 billion packages were delivered between January and July, surpassing the total volume of 2017, according to data published by the State Post Bureau of China.
""There were so many touching stories amid the battle against COVID-19. We think it is meaningful to record and publish them,"" says Ye Feng, vice-president of YTO Express.
The book fair organizer had also invited experts to share their knowledge and insights into the fight against COVID-19. Those in attendance included the highly acclaimed doctor Zhang Wenhong, the head of the Center for Infectious Disease at Huashan Hospital of Fudan University.
During a seminar held during the book fair, Zhang hails the importance of technology in the nation's fight against COVID-19, pointing out that Chinese medical experts took just 10 days to complete the separation and genome sequencing of the virus. He adds that medical teams in China did not have the capability to do so during the SARS outbreak in 2003.
""This achievement is a reflection of the development of China's science and technology sectors in the past 17 years,"" he says.
""Life in the second half of the year will not be more difficult than the present. We could possibly be as happy as we are now, insofar that medical workers and citizens maintain high levels of vigilance.""

As the first African leader to visit China in the past three years due to the COVID-19 pandemic, Tanzanian President Samia Suluhu Hassan's official visit to Beijing from Wednesday to Friday is of great significance.
Her visit is being closely watched not only by African countries, which will be looking for signals on China's Africa policy following the election of the country's top leadership body, but also by those countries in the West hoping to find something with which to derail Sino-African ties.
Yet these countries' smearing of China's laudable economic and trade cooperation with African countries only prompts the two sides to cherish their collaboration and mutual trust.
That the two leaders agreed to elevate relations to the level of a comprehensive strategic partnership and further deepen the practical cooperation between the two countries in the digital, green and blue economies speaks volumes of the substantiality of the interaction between the two sides.
It also exposes the ill intentions of those Western critics, since the cooperation being proposed will undoubtedly bring tangible benefits to the Tanzanian people.
Speaking with President Xi Jinping on Thursday, Hassan said that China is a real friend of Tanzania, and Tanzania in turn wants to be a reliable partner of China forever. That remark as well as the tangible outcomes of the practical cooperation between China and African countries are the best rebuttal to the malicious calumny of those Western critics.
China has constructed numerous hospitals, schools, stadiums, roads, railways, bridges and prosperous industrial parks, and created countless job opportunities, all of which have improved the well-being of local people.
China and Africa have forged an unbreakable bond of brotherhood in the struggle against imperialism and colonialism. That historical legacy has laid a solid foundation on which to translate the Global Development Initiative China has proposed into concrete actions to tap the complementarity between the Chinese and African economies based on the principles that China always adheres to in its cooperation with other countries - mutual respect, candid exchanges, mutual assistance and win-win outcomes - principles that mean that its cooperation comes with no political strings attached.
As President Xi said, China's modernization is not Westernization. Its achievements in improving people's livelihoods and revitalizing the rural areas provide a reference for African countries in their efforts to explore their own development paths.",INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (90%); POLITICAL & SOCIAL IDEOLOGIES (89%); TYPES OF GOVERNMENT (78%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (77%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (77%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (77%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (77%); PANDEMICS (77%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (76%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (74%); GREEN ECONOMY (74%); BLUE GROWTH (72%); ALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPS (69%); JOB CREATION (69%); OCEAN ECONOMY (69%); STRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS (69%); BLUE ECONOMY (67%); STADIUMS & ARENAS (50%)

The United States is undoubtedly suffering from a grave resurgence of the novel coronavirus. With more than 100,000 new infections appearing each day on the weekend, it has neared the level of ""the darkest days"" during the previous Donald Trump administration.
Despite being the country with the most abundant supply of COVID-19 vaccines in the world, the vaccination rate in the US has stagnated after reaching 40 percent a couple of months ago, staying at about 48 percent now, well below the level of 70 percent that the Joe Biden administration vowed to realize by the end of July. That explains why on Friday President Joe Biden called on state and local governments to give $100 to those opting to take jabs, to encourage more people to be vaccinated.
Partly thanks to the anti-science legacy of the Trump administration, the US has both the highest number of COVID-19 cases and the highest number of deaths caused by the virus. As of Sunday the total number of infections in the US had reached more than 35 million among which nearly 630,000 people have died.
Despite the appearance of new strains of the virus, particularly the more contagious Delta variant, which has forced many countries and regions to impose new lockdowns and prompted them to limit close contacts, the Biden administration's efforts to tame the virus have been hampered by the unwillingness of many people to get their COVID-19 shots and maintain social distancing, even to wear face masks.
In other words, US society has not yet come to terms with how big a threat the virus is. No wonder some state governments are openly playing down the situation in a bid to avoid hurting the local economy.
And the Biden administration cannot blame it all on its predecessor, as except for the fast implementation of its national vaccination program in the first few months after it took office, the ingrained anti-science mentality in US society has been reinforced by the administration's organized and systemic endeavors to try and politicize the pandemic, particularly its relentless efforts to scapegoat China for it.
Instead of focusing on controlling the virus at home and maintaining the momentum of the vaccination drive, the administration has spent the past few months trying to coerce the World Health Organization to deny the findings of its team of experts that conducted field research in Wuhan. It is now attempting to manipulate the WHO in a so-called phase two origin tracing investigation in China.
A misjudgment that both the Biden and Trump administrations seem to have made on the pandemic and China is that they believe that merging the two challenges into one can save the US half the input required to tackle them. But by doing that they have ignored the real problems the US faces.
The US and the world have been paying the price for misjudgments of the Biden and Trump administrations. The question is how long they will continue to do so.",VACCINES (91%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (90%); VIRUSES (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH (89%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (89%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (89%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (77%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (77%); DEATH RATES (76%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012 (76%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (74%); DEATH & DYING (73%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (72%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (72%); INVESTIGATIONS (72%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (66%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (50%)

What's wrong with the world? What should we do about it?
These, as President Xi Jinping said in his remarks at the first session of the 17th G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia, on Tuesday, are the questions of our times.
He called on all countries to join hands to answer these questions so as to tide over the current difficulties and create a better future.
As he once again made clear, China's answers to these questions are: it is the divisions and confrontations within the international community that are the fundamental problem, and the remedy is for all countries to stand with one another in the face of risks and challenges, whatever their differences may be.
Certainly, as all must know, the challenges are taxing and many, from the stubborn COVID-19 pandemic and the fragile global economy to the tense geopolitical environment, climate change and the food and energy crises. And all of these issues are compounding one another due to the inadequate global governance that is a consequence of the lack of accord. Yet all these challenges brook no delay in meeting them with the conviction that they can be overcome with courage and solidarity.
Urging the other G20 leaders to recognize that divisions lead nowhere and solidarity is strength, Xi called on them to do their best for the cause of global development.
As its response to global crisis showed, the G20, which brings together the developed and major developing countries, can be an effective platform for action when its members take a concerted approach to address a crisis. As frontrunners in development, they have the capability to realize the summit's theme of ""Recover Together, Recover Stronger"" and ensure that in doing so no countries are left behind.
The Global Development Initiative and the Global Security Initiative that Xi has already put forward are aimed at facilitating an international consensus on promoting common development and realizing peace and stability which are necessary for preventing a divergent and unbalanced global recovery, and many countries have already welcomed these prescriptions for the world's woes.
In his speech, Xi not only pointed the way for countries to cope with the pandemic crisis and accelerate an economic restart, he also pointed the way to inject stronger momentum into international cooperation to realize a global community with a shared future.
Solidarity and the shouldering of responsibilities were what Xi asked of his fellow leaders. How they respond to that appeal will to a great extent determine how the world emerges from the present headwinds.",NEGATIVE NEWS (89%); GLOBALIZATION (78%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (77%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (77%); BUSINESS NEWS (75%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (74%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (73%); ECONOMIC CRISIS (72%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (68%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (68%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (68%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (68%); PANDEMICS (68%); FOOD CRISES & SHORTAGES (67%)

The closing ceremony of the Beijing 2022 Winter Olympics on Sunday marked the conclusion of what has been a ""safe, simple and splendid"" spectacle of sports.
As the first global sports event that has been held as scheduled since the outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic, the Games have captured hearts around the world.
It was due to the full cooperation between China and the International Olympic Committee and the strong support of all stakeholders that the Games, with the broadest participation of athletes in the history of the Winter Olympics, could finally overcome all the challenges and display to the world the heartwarming togetherness that is now an integral part of the Olympic motto.
Thanks to the strict implementation of a closed-loop COVID-19 pandemic prevention and control mode, and the cooperation of all athletes as well as the dedicated efforts of the staff workers and volunteers, the Games saw no clusters of infections in the three venues and there has been no resurgence of the epidemic in the host city.
Over the 16 days of the Games, there have been hugs and tears, and numerous memorable moments, not least those in which the competitors have offered their rivals heartfelt encouragement and warm congratulations.
That the worldwide audience for the Games has been the largest in the history of the winter Olympics has only exposed how small-minded and mean-spirited the ""diplomatic boycott"" by some Western politicians was and how hollow the cries of alarm of the anti-China forces have sounded.
The togetherness displayed at the Games should be thought-provoking for peoples and countries in conflict. What if they could set aside their differences and appreciate one another as equal members of the one big human family?
The differences between civilizations, religions, cultures and societies should not be reasons for conflicts but sources for countries and peoples to learn from each other for the common good of humanity.
The legacy of the Games can go far beyond being part of Olympic history or encouraging a new generation to enjoy winter sports if decision-makers have taken the opportunity to see that competition and togetherness are not mutually exclusive.
The efficient organization of the Games and the state-of-the-art services and facilities have all cast the spotlight on a prosperous, dynamic and confident host country seeking to make its contributions to the building of a community with a shared future for mankind.
And a common takeaway for the athletes has been the friendliness and openness of the Chinese people. That is something that some in seats of power should come and experience for themselves.
Against the backdrop of the acute challenges the world faces today, the Games should encourage the international community to come together for a shared future.",

The goal of the Asia-Pacific's development should be to build a regional community with a shared future. This is the message President Xi Jinping gave in his speech at the 29th APEC Economic Leaders' Meeting in Bangkok on Friday.
His call reflects the common aspiration of the countries in the region, given the tremendous challenges they face amid the fast-changing global environment. Demonstrating his strong sense of geographical and cultural belonging, President Xi called the Asia-Pacific ""our home"", which enjoys some unique favorable conditions and values that enable it to make the right choice whenever it reaches a crossroad.
Thanks to robust economic cooperation over the past decades, the region has created what can be called an ""Asia-Pacific miracle"", and become an economic powerhouse consolidating the global industry and supply chains, and driving global growth.
Compared with some other regions where some countries still follow the law of the jungle because it suits their geopolitical, zero-sum games, the Asia-Pacific believes in mutually beneficial cooperation and common development, which can be partly attributed to the regional nations' faith in peaceful coexistence.
As an ancient saying goes, a good neighbor is much better than a brother far off. Mutual assistance has always been a regional trait - even before the term international relations was coined. That historical legacy, along with economic globalization, particularly after China launched reform and opening-up, has greatly contributed to the region's collective development. And the widening common interests of the regional countries, based on openness, inclusiveness, mutual respect, peace and stability, have reinforced their belief in their shared historical values.
In just more than a week, Cambodia, Indonesia and Thailand have held the top-level meetings of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations, the G20 and the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation respectively, providing a platform for many world leaders to have their first in-person meetings since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out nearly three years ago.
By doing so, the three Asia-Pacific countries have not only highlighted the unique Asian values, but also showed the region's potential to drive global economic recovery, stabilize the global industry and supply chains, as well as address the global deficit in trust, governance and communication.
Also, thanks to the unique Asian values and regional solidarity, the attempts of some external forces to sow the seeds of discord among the countries in the region have failed. Asia-Pacific countries should bear in mind their shared future, and work together to make the region a better place by promoting low-carbon, sustainable development.
To that end, as Xi said, ""we must join hands together to build an Asia-Pacific community with a shared future and take Asia-Pacific cooperation to a new height"".",EDITORIALS & OPINIONS (99%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (89%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (89%); TALKS & MEETINGS (89%); EMERGING MARKETS (79%); ASEAN COUNTRIES (78%); BUSINESS NEWS (78%); GLOBALIZATION (78%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (78%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (78%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (77%); ECONOMIC POLICY (77%); ECONOMIC RECOVERY (77%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (72%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (72%); SUSTAINABILITY (70%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (60%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (60%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (60%)

China has so far administered 164.47 million doses of COVID-19 vaccines, with around 24.5 million doses given in the past six days, as the country continues to accelerate its vaccine rollout.
Yet that is still a far cry from the amount needed to build herd immunity, which requires at least 70 percent of the population to be vaccinated, a goal that the government is striving to achieve by the middle of next year.
It is an urgent task for the government to vaccinate all those who are eligible as soon as possible, so the country can reopen to the outside world after more than a year of pandemic-induced restrictions.
China is now producing 5 million vaccine doses a day, and will likely have produced 3 billion doses of vaccines by the end of the year, according to the National Health Commission. So unlike many other countries that have seen their vaccination programs stalled mainly because of supply shortages or delayed shipments, it will be able to produce the vaccines it needs to achieve its goal.
But hindering the endeavor to achieve a higher rate of vaccination at an earlier date is the fact that many people are still hesitant to get their shots due to various concerns. For example, some are still doubtful about the safety and efficacy of the new vaccines, while others think it's unnecessary to take the jabs given that the pandemic has been largely contained in China. Not to mention those who just want to ""take a free ride"", by waiting till herd immunity is achieved in the country next year.
To overcome these concerns, the government needs to work harder to drive home the fact that COVID-19 vaccines meet rigorous scientific standards, and have proven to be both safe and effective.
Yet while pushing forward with the vaccination program, officials at all levels must bear in mind that they should not force through their efforts — for example, by making vaccination compulsory for residents — no matter how well intended such policies may be. Doing so will only exacerbate public doubts and do a disservice to the fight against the virus.
How well the government can help the public use reason to prevail over fear, and trust in science to override ignorance in the vaccination drive will serve as a big testament to its governance capacity.
Encouraging every citizen to accept the responsibility and obligation to be vaccinated is the only way to build a nationwide firewall against the coronavirus.",VACCINES (97%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); VIRUSES (89%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (78%); MANDATORY VACCINATIONS (78%); SAFETY (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (73%); NEGATIVE NEWS (73%); BIOLOGICS MFG (72%); SUPPLY CHAIN DISRUPTIONS (66%); SHORTAGES (52%)

China has officially joined the COVID-19 vaccine alliance known as COVAX with the signing of an agreement with GAVI, the co-leader of the global initiative aimed at speeding up the development, manufacture and equitable distribution of new vaccines.
In the words of Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, joining COVAX is an important step Beijing has taken to uphold its concept of ""a shared community of health for all"" and to honor its commitment of making any vaccines it develops a global public good.
As one of the earliest countries to start researching and developing COVID-19 diagnostics, treatments and vaccines, China has a number of promising vaccine candidates reportedly in the pipeline.
Once a vaccine proves viable, Beijing has promised it will be made widely available, with priority given to the most vulnerable countries and communities.
COVAX, for its part, can greatly amplify that potential Chinese contribution thanks to its role as a risk-sharing mechanism for the pooled procurement and equitable distribution of COVID-19 vaccines.
As COVAX is coordinated by Gavi, the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations and the World Health Organization, it will be more efficient in accomplishing the initial goal of ending the acute phase of the pandemic.
Committing to the COVAX framework also conforms to Beijing's pledges to support the WHO and uphold the mechanisms of multilateral global governance.
Joining COVAX will also offer a dependable guarantee for China's own defense against the pandemic.
The just concluded eight-day National Day-Mid-Autumn Festival holiday proved that having basically gained an upper hand over the virus, not only is everyday life recovering in China, but the economy too is quickly gaining momentum.
Yet, just as obvious is the fact that this wouldn't have been possible if the country had not dramatically scaled down and strictly controlled its contacts with the rest of the world. The constant reports of ""imported cases"" keep reminding us of the simple truth that in the face of a pandemic, no one is safe until everyone is. Helping others therefore is helping oneself.
Joining and doing its part within COVAX means an additional guarantee for the country's own safety. After all, as long as there are countries, regions and groups suffering, no country, including China, can feel safe.
That is why COVAX should not only strive to ensure equitable access to the more than 170 countries and entities that have joined it, but also make sure no country or region or group of people in the world will be left unattended in this critical battle of collective defense.

Two-thirds of the world's population, some 5 billion people, will need to be vaccinated to have immunity to COVID-19.
One often overlooked issue that will likely surface when the time comes to distribute a COVID-19 vaccine is the need for billions of little glass vials, needles, syringes and other things required to distribute such a vaccine.
China is likely to play a key role in manufacturing those products for use around the world. China and India are the largest manufacturers of these products.
Governments and biotech companies are already thinking about this challenge even if, at this stage, it is still unclear which of the 100 or so vaccines under development around the world will fill those glass vials.
It is not unlikely that one or more of the vaccines that eventually contribute to beating the virus will be developed in China. When that happens, it will help elevate China's biotechnology sector to world-class.
At a virtual event marking the opening on Monday of the 73rd session of the World Health Assembly－the decision-making body of the World Health Organization-President Xi Jinping committed to making a China-developed vaccine a global public good.
At the same meeting, Xi also backed the idea of a WHO-led independent review of the global response to COVID-19, and announced that China will contribute $2 billion over two years to deal with the virus as well as the economic fallout around the world, especially in developing nations.
China also plans to work with the United Nations to set up a humanitarian response hub to strengthen supply chains for a vaccine and response.
Of course, all these actions hinge on a proven vaccine becoming available.
A vaccine for COVID-19 is likely to be developed faster than any other vaccine in recent history. It usually takes about a decade to get vaccines for new viruses to market. We are five months into the pandemic and there are a bunch of projects in human trials, including five in China.
China's manufacturing capacity will be key to producing enough doses of vaccine to cover everyone.
The development of a vaccine is a goal that is tailor-made for China's biotech industry.
The pandemic has forced the biotech industry to supercharge its innovation capabilities. Regulators in the United States, Canada and Europe as well as China and Japan have put COVID-19 vaccine and treatment development projects on the fast track.
China's regulator has given the go-ahead for early stage human trials for at least four vaccine candidates. It aims to have a vaccine ready for emergency use by September.
CanSino Biologics, Sinovac Biotech, the Wuhan Institute of Biological Products (an arm of Sinopharm Group) and the Beijing Institute of Biotechnology have all moved to human trials.
China is also contributing to the race for a treatment for COVID-19. Last week, Sorrento Therapeutics, a US-China biotech company, reported that one of its antibodies had completely inhibited the coronavirus infection from interreacting with a receptor after just four days.
These development products are varied. They are being done by startups, government-supported companies and research institutes.
The WHO first pre-qualified a Chinese vaccine for global use in 2013. At the time, it had 34 vaccine manufacturers－four international joint ventures, seven State-run manufacturers and 23 private ones. By 2018, China was producing around 700 million doses of vaccine per year, making it one of the largest producers.
China has strengths in areas of big data analytics, artificial intelligence and new technologies, not to mention access to a huge amount of patient data. A more comprehensive institutional framework to support abstract research would help not only with future vaccines but by strengthening the industry as a whole.
Certainly the market at home and abroad is there to support the relatively rapid development of China's biotech industry.
The efforts to stamp down the coronavirus could give China the X-factor that future innovation-based programs need. Chinese researchers have long been known for their reticence to take risks, but the current need for quick thinking could help to change that.
The global urgency for a vaccine may encourage a little more risk-taking and, potentially, reward it with much success－paving the way for future research innovators as well.

The significance of German Chancellor Olaf Scholz's visit to China on Friday cannot be judged by the time he spent in Beijing but by what it achieved in terms of bilateral relations and trade and investment.
That Scholz became the first major Western leader to visit China in three years shows the impact the COVID-19 pandemic has had on international trade and travel. And yet the United States, instead of mending fractures, continues to use its unilateral and protectionist policies to divide the world into rival blocs in order to check China's rise. Germany is one of the countries the US wants to exploit to target China, because it is not only the largest economy in Europe but also has close economic and trade ties with China.
However, Scholz recognized China as an important trade partner of Germany and the European Union, and said he would deepen cooperation with China, promote bilateral investment, and keep upholding multilateralism and opposing decoupling.
Also, by leading a large team of business leaders from Germany, Scholz has not only cast a vote of confidence in the Chinese economy and market, but also showed Germany still adheres to the strategic independence Angela Merkel built, bringing huge benefits to the country and its trade partners such as China.
This year marks the 50th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Germany. Germany has been China's largest trade partner in Europe for 47 straight years, and last year, bilateral trade, for the first time, exceeded $200 billion, up 22.5 percent year-on-year, showing how absurd Washington's efforts to ""decouple"" China from the rest of the world are.
Thanks to the complementarity of the Chinese and German economies, and their common interest in upholding multilateralism and promoting globalization, the two sides, to a large extent, have not been influenced by external powers. And it's especially heartening to see the two sides agree to deepen cooperation on a wide range of sectors, from mechanical, auto and chemical engineering to smart manufacturing, industrial internet, artificial intelligence and the green economy.
As President Xi Jinping said, no matter how strong the resistance is, as long as the two countries follow the principles of mutual respect, seek common ground while shelving differences, promote exchanges and mutual learning and boost win-win cooperation, the general direction of bilateral relations will not deviate from the right track.
Scholz's willingness to deepen Sino-German cooperation, promote investment, support multilateralism and oppose decoupling, and help improve China-EU ties are a valuable response from a major Western leader to China's call for peaceful development.",BUSINESS NEWS (90%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (90%); GERMAN CHANCELLORS (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (90%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (90%); EUROPEAN UNION (89%); FOREIGN POLICY (89%); INTERNATIONAL TRADE (89%); GLOBALIZATION (78%); PROTECTIONISM (77%); THIS DAY IN HISTORY (73%); FOREIGN RELATIONS (72%); GREEN ECONOMY (72%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (71%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (71%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (71%); DIPLOMATIC SERVICES (70%); ENGINEERING (70%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (70%); ANNIVERSARIES (65%); ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE (60%); CHEMICAL ENGINEERING (60%)

President Xi Jinping and French President Emmanuel Macron on Tuesday vowed to bolster communication and coordination in response to global challenges ranging from climate change to food security. They made the commitments on the sidelines of the G20 Summit in Bali, Indonesia, during their first face-to-face meeting since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic.
The high-level exchanges the two countries have maintained and the joint stand they seek to take are a boon to the world amid the complex and volatile international situation.
Saying the consequences of the Russia-Ukraine conflict stretch beyond Europe's frontiers, both leaders agreed on the urgency for de-escalation and the need to prevent any use of nuclear weapons.
The talks between the two leaders underscored the close coordination between the two countries and the great importance the two sides attach to their relations, which were upgraded to a comprehensive strategic partnership in 2004, the first between China and a major Western country.
The two countries have developed robust economic and trade relations in recent years, and see eye to eye with each other on such key global issues as multilateralism, economic globalization and climate change. All this has laid a solid foundation for the sound and healthy development of Sino-French relationship.
Indeed, among the major Western powers France stands out with a foreign policy tradition that features independence from external influence, a virtue that has been inherited by nearly every French leader since General Charles de Gaulle. In fact, France was the first Western country to establish diplomatic relations with the People's Republic of China in 1964.
Thus it comes as no surprise that Xi, during his talks with Macron, emphasized a spirit of independence and autonomy when speaking on how to further develop China-France and China-EU relations. He noted that both China and France are important forces in the multipolar world, and the two countries should respect each other's core interests and major concerns and deepen pragmatic cooperation in such areas as green energy, aviation and nuclear energy.
As a key member of the European Union, France can also play a key role in promoting China-EU economic and trade cooperation, since the mutual trust and friendship between China and France, and the strategic autonomy France upholds are conducive to the strengthening of China-EU relations.
Last year, China-EU trade exceeded $800 billion for the first time while investments exceeded $270 billion. In the first eight months of this year, total trade between China and the EU amounted to $575.22 billion, up 8.8 percent year-on-year, and the EU's investment in China totaled $7.45 billion, up 121.5 percent year-on-year.

No matter how the Republican Party, still under the sway of former president Donald Trump, tries to doctor what happened that day, Jan 6, 2021, is marked in history as one of infamy for the United States.
One year ago, supporters of Trump stormed the Capitol building to try and prevent Congress from certifying the Electoral College votes that would make Joe Biden president of the United States, leaving five people dead and many others injured.
The insurrection was both a crime and a scar on the conscience of a country that touts itself as a ""beacon"" of democracy. And the amnesic aftermath of the ugly events of that day has further laid bare the ills in the US democratic system.
One year after the storming of the Capitol, apart from having dramatically different perceptions of what went down, Democrats and Republicans remain split on almost every issue of public interest, ranging from gun control, healthcare to the COVID-19 pandemic response.
On Monday, the US shattered a single-day record with more than 1 million COVID-19 cases amid the rapid spread of the Omicron variant and the easing of prevention and control measures in the country. The fact that the US remains the country worst hit by the pandemic, with the most cases and deaths, is itself a tragic indictment of its political system.
The Jan 6 insurrection was the final nail in the coffin of the US' claim that it was championing democracy.
The US has for decades flagrantly violated the basic norms of international law and diplomatic norms by interfering in the internal affairs of other countries in the name of democracy, turning a blind eye to the skeletons in its own cupboard.
Yet a multitude of problems at home, such as rising racism, surging gun violence and a widening rich-poor gap, all testify to the deterioration and dysfunction of its political system.
A recent study by the Robert Bosch Foundation in Germany found that over half of US citizens think its system does not function at all under the current circumstances.
Neither Americans nor people elsewhere can continue to dismiss as negligible the serious problems plaguing the US' democratic system.
Jan 6 should forever serve as a sober reminder to the US that it should clean its own house first before pointing an accusing finger at others.
Even the ""democracy summit"" staged by Washington last month cannot repair the US' damaged image nor salvage the decaying core of American-style democracy.
Such antics cannot possibly help the US solve the deep-rooted political, social and economic problems that have plagued it for decades.
Even judged from a low standard, the US' democratic system is hardly the ""envy of the world"" as it only exists in form, not in substance.",

If always looking at something through a prism of traditional bias, one can hardly see it in an objective manner. That is the problem a lot of Western media have with how they look at things relating to China. What they have said about China's COVID-19 vaccines is an example of how they cannot stop looking through their prisms of prejudice.
China proclaimed that its vaccines would be a global public good and it has been good to its word providing many countries, developing ones in particular, with its vaccines in different ways. Yet Western media outlets describe that as ""vaccine diplomacy"", meant to increase China's global influence.
Then, with China's vaccines being welcomed by an increasing number of countries, they started to question the safety and efficacy of China's vaccines. When a Chinese virologist talked about how to increase the protection rate of China's vaccines recently, what he said was misinterpreted by Western media outlets to cast doubt over the efficacy of China's four approved vaccines.
But the facts speak for themselves. Sinopharm's Vero vaccine, for example, achieved 79 percent efficacy in a Phase III study conducted in 10 countries. In a separate study, the United Arab Emirates achieved 86 percent efficacy. The efficacy of Sinovac's CoronaVac vaccine ranges from 50-78 percent, according to preliminary studies from Brazil and Indonesia, which have received a lot of vaccines from China.
In principle, the efficacy values improve even further to over 80 percent when severe courses of disease are taken into account, namely those that also require hospitalization.
It is difficult to test the efficacy of the vaccines in China because very few cases of infection have occurred since the country generally controlled the epidemic last year, thanks to its effective control and prevention measures. Research is therefore dependent on studies conducted in heavily affected countries such as Brazil.
The efficacy rate of China's vaccines may not be as high as those seen in the mRNA vaccines from BioNTech/Pfizer or Moderna, which the companies claim have over 95 percent efficacy, they are still significantly more effective than some influenza vaccines, some of which only achieve efficacy levels of 30-60 percent. In addition, China's vaccines have proved to be very safe. There have been no serious adverse reactions reported as there have been for some other vaccines.
Western media therefore have no reason to question the efficacy of China's vaccines when China has already provided more than 100 countries and international organizations with vaccines. Neither can they underestimate the contributions China's vaccines have made to the fight against COVID-19.
What the world needs is solidarity rather than the smearing of vaccines or the efforts of a particular country.","VACCINES (96%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); DRUG SAFETY (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); INFLUENZA (78%); MICROBIOLOGY (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (78%); SAFETY (78%); VIROLOGY (78%); VIRUSES (78%); RESEARCH REPORTS (66%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (50%)

Four days into the official annual Spring Festival transport season, which started on Monday and will last until Feb 25, and two weeks to go before lunar New Year's Eve, the highly transmissible Omicron variant of the novel coronavirus, in tandem with the Delta strain, is dampening the festive atmosphere of the year's most important holiday.
Since the initial curb on domestic travels following the COVID-19 outbreak in January 2020, this will be the third Spring Festival to be disrupted by pandemic containment restrictions. Many people working away from home may have canceled Spring Festival family reunions in the past two years due to rigid restraints on holiday travel. Chances are they may have to do so for a third time.
Following the Omicron discovery on home soil, national and local public health authorities have issued travel alerts for the Spring Festival holiday, which, like the past two holiday seasons, generally urge people to avoid cross-region trips and celebrate the lunar New Year wherever they are. Considering Omicron has spread to six provinces and nine localities in 10 days following its detection in Tianjin, such vigilance and precaution are understandable.
Yet some local authorities are obviously going too far, by wantonly erecting artificial obstacles against the spirit of rule of law. The ongoing infections in Xi'an, Shaanxi province, have been a costly reminder of the virus' dangerous potential to affect entire communities, from neighborhoods to cities of dozens of millions.
To discourage cross-region travel, for instance, some localities have significantly widened the scope of compulsory quarantine. Specifically, those whose electronic itinerary card carries a star, indicating his or her itinerary in the previous 14 days includes a city with a high- or medium-risk community, may face compulsory quarantine when they travel across regions.
Having been to an area that includes a high- or medium-risk place doesn't equate to physically being in a risk area. The star mark is only a reference for further verification, and doesn't mean the bearer's own health status is problematic.
A dozen central government agencies have issued a joint directive meant to prevent local authorities from unnecessarily restraining holiday travel. Considering the pressure on local authorities for pandemic control, we can only hope they will be as sensible in implementing prevention and control measures. But should they cross the line and do things that are not legally permissible, they should be held accountable.
Given the notoriously high transmissibility of the new variant, not only localities where Omicron cases have been identified, but actually all local authorities have raised their alarm levels. But they should not resort to a one-means-suits-all approach for the sake of convenience. They need to be prepared, not over-zealous.",CHINESE NEW YEAR (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); FESTIVALS (90%); HOLIDAYS & OBSERVANCES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); TRENDS & EVENTS (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (77%); CORONAVIRUSES (77%); ISOLATION & QUARANTINE (77%); VIRUSES (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (76%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (74%); LEISURE TRAVEL (74%); RULE OF LAW (73%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (71%); FAMILY (68%)

The contrast is striking. Many countries have asked the United States for COVID-19 vaccines, but the US has not provided any doses of any vaccine to any country, whereas an increasing number of countries are receiving vaccines from China, which has even provided vaccines as aid to underdeveloped countries.
And China donated 300,000 vaccine doses to peacekeepers of the United Nations on Friday, and those who are on peacekeeping missions in Africa will get the shots first.
The US is yet to finalize its plan to send millions of doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to neighboring Mexico and Canada.
The US has hoarded far more doses of vaccines than it needs, and its control of raw materials for the manufacturing of vaccines has negatively impacted the control of the pandemic.
There is even a fight brewing between the European Union and the United Kingdom over vaccines. Ursula von der Leyen, the European Commission president, said on Wednesday she was no longer prepared for vaccines made in the EU to be exported to the UK and other countries which have been markedly quicker rolling out inoculation programs. Von der Leyen has instructed her officials to prepare to invoke Article 122 in EU treaty law that would place the bloc on a war footing. It would permit the EU to seize factories, waive intellectual property rights and override patents and impose export bans.
It is clear from all these that vaccines will not be forthcoming from the EU and the US for developing countries.
Statistics from the United Nations show that while 75 percent of vaccinations have been administered in 10 developed countries, there are 130 countries which have not received a single vaccine dose yet. It is estimated that some underdeveloped countries will not be able to have their residents inoculated until 2024.
Rather than reflecting on how selfish and myopic some of the developed countries are regarding the global distribution of vaccines, politicians in those countries speak ill of the vaccines China and Russia have manufactured, even labeling China's provision of vaccines as a global public good as ""vaccine diplomacy"".
China is a committed front-runner in promoting equitable access to vaccines, and the safety and effectiveness of Chinese vaccines are earning recognition across the world.
China will press ahead with its provision of vaccines for as many countries as possible no matter what politicians in the West are saying as it knows that it is doing the right thing.
China hopes that those developed countries will realize as early as possible that they need to contribute to the global solidarity for the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic to bring it to an end as soon as possible, rather than erode it by doing what they are doing right now.","VACCINES (99%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); EUROPEAN UNION (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INTERNATIONAL TRADE (90%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (89%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (89%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (89%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (87%); BIOLOGICS MFG (78%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY (78%); INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY LAW (78%); MANUFACTURING FACILITIES (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); SAFETY (78%); PEACEKEEPING (77%); UNITED NATIONS (75%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (75%); EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS (72%); EUROPEAN UNION LAW (72%); ELECTIONS & POLITICS (71%); EXPORT CONTROLS (70%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (70%); PATENT LAW (69%); PATENTS (64%); TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (50%)

No wonder the World Health Organization has strongly criticized the controls on COVID-19 vaccine exports and the raw materials for their manufacture, as such controls will have a devastating impact on the supply of these essential vaccines worldwide.
The European Union's extension of its controls over exports of COVID-19 vaccines until June and the United States' implementation of the Defense Production Act to curb the exports of raw materials for the production of such vaccines leave poorer countries in the lurch and show that the global solidarity necessary to contain the spread of the novel coronavirus remains unforthcoming.
That European countries and the US are claiming first dibs on the vaccines is because of their high number of infections, which has a lot to do with their failure to effectively cut the channels for the transmission of the virus. Now they are pinning their hopes on the vaccines to win their battles against the virus.
But those countries should know that although the vaccines are undoubtedly powerful weapons in the fight against the virus and bring hope of saving lives, they are not a consummate panacea.
The best results in stopping the spread of the virus will likely be obtained if strict prevention and control measures are combined with vaccination. Bringing an end to the COVID-19 pandemic at the earliest opportunity requires this of all countries.
The EU countries and the US would not be so concerned with the early vaccination of all their residents if they had the spread of the virus under control, and thus would not feel the need to be first in line for the vaccines and the relevant raw materials.
China is providing vaccines for dozens of developing countries in urgent need of them and it has also exported vaccines to another more than 40 countries. At the same time, it is donating vaccines to United Nations peacekeepers and has already committed to providing 10 million doses for COVAX. The country has also said it is ready to work with the International Olympic Committee to provide vaccines for athletes taking part in the Olympics.
That is not only because it has done such a great job of containing the spread of the virus domestically that it has enough leeway to provide vaccines for other countries. But also because it knows that it has the obligation to help those developing countries and the global fight against the virus.
Instead of trying to get their hands on all the vaccines they can, the EU countries and the US should look at the bigger picture and implement strict prevention and control measures that their people have to abide by, so that there can be fairer distribution of vaccines globally. They should bear in mind that unless everyone is safe, no one is safe.",VACCINES (97%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); EXPORT CONTROLS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (90%); VIRUSES (90%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (89%); EUROPEAN UNION (89%); EUROPEAN UNION INSTITUTIONS (89%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (89%); OLYMPICS (89%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (89%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); INTERNATIONAL TRADE (77%); UNITED NATIONS (77%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (77%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (73%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (72%); PEACEKEEPING (71%); OLYMPIC COMMITTEES (60%)

At a national conference held on Wednesday in Beijing, two Chinese scientists, aircraft designer Gu Songfen and nuclear expert Wang Dazhong, were awarded China's top science award for their outstanding contributions to scientific and technological innovation.
The research group led by Zhong Nanshan that helped spearhead China's fight against COVID-19 received the team award.
The nation's top science award was initiated in 2000, and no more than two scientists are granted an individual award every year for their contributions to the cause of science and technology in the country. A total of 35 scientists have won awards in the past more than two decades.
With the country's economic development having reached a stage where transformation of its industrial structure is key to its sound and sustainable progress, innovations and breakthroughs in key areas have never been so essential.
The restrictions imposed by some countries on exports of key technologies to China speak volumes about how important it is for China to depend on its own scientific efforts to advance its development.
As President Xi Jinping said earlier this year, China cannot ask for, buy or beg for core technologies in key fields from other countries. ""Only by holding these technologies in our own hands can we ensure economic security, national security and security in other areas.""
Only by developing technologies endogenously can China safeguard its future development.
The great leaps forward China has made in a wide range of areas, which have greatly promoted its development, can be attributed to the painstaking efforts of scientists such as Gu and Wang, and researchers such as Zhong and his team. The dedication of Chinese scientists to their work has made the country a leading innovator.
From the design of jet aircraft and nuclear reactors to its COVID-19 research and more, it is inspiring to see what China is doing.
However, the country still has a long way to go as far as basic scientific research is concerned. More money needs to be spent on basic research to consolidate the foundation for long-term and sustainable development of the country's science and technology.
More needs to be done to train more scientists who are willing to bury themselves in basic research. And better material conditions and a conducive environment need to be forthcoming so these scientists can focus on their research.
China knows well how the development of science and technology is propelling its modernization. And the development of its capacity for innovation will not only promote its own progress, but also contribute to the progress of human civilization at large.",SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (90%); AWARDS & PRIZES (89%); EMERGING TECHNOLOGY (78%); EXPERIMENTATION & RESEARCH (78%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (78%); NATIONAL SECURITY (78%); PRODUCT INNOVATION (78%); SCIENCE FUNDING (78%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (77%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (74%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (74%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (71%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (71%); BUSINESS NEWS (69%); ECONOMIC NEWS (69%); SUSTAINABILITY (68%)

If all factors are taken into consideration, US President Joe Biden's implied questioning of China's sincerity in fulfilling its commitments under the two-year deal agreed between the two countries is totally unreasonable.
Despite the difficulties created by the COVID-19 pandemic, China has done all it can to increase its imports from the United States, open its market and improve its business environment.
After growing 8.3 percent year-on-year in 2020, Sino-US trade surged nearly 30 percent last year, hitting $755.6 billion, consolidating China's position as the US' largest trade partner, and the US China's third. That figure has even been suppressed by the exorbitant tariffs on Chinese imports the Biden administration inherited from its predecessor.
Given this backdrop, Biden's statement on Wednesday that it was too soon to make commitments on lifting US tariffs on Chinese goods, saying ""I would like to be able to conditionally say that they are delivering on their promises, or are delivering on more of their promises, and can unwind some, but the time is not ripe"", is particularly grating on the ear.
In the first place, it should be seen that the high inflation in the US has dramatically increased the prices of US exports of energy and goods, led by agricultural products. Moreover, the two US administrations' failed responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and the generous consumption subsidies they have offered have reduced the output of manufactured goods in the country by reducing people's willingness to work. Worse, dozens of additional Chinese entities, including companies, institutes and individuals, have been blacklisted by the Biden administration since it took office on the basis of groundless national security concerns. Not to mention the great lengths the administration has gone to in its attempts to reshape the global supply chains and isolate China from the global market and technological sectors.
The self-contradictory nature of the US administration's trade policy and practices with China is mind-boggling. It requires China to buy more from the US, while sanctioning almost all major Chinese industrial and technological leading players, preventing them from doing business with the US and its allies, banning China from buying this or that, and keeping exorbitant tariffs on China's exports.
Ironically many of China's exports to the US are manufactured by US companies in China, and statistics show that about 90 percent of the punitive tariffs the US imposed on imports from China are actually paid by US consumers and companies in the form of inflated prices. In other words, the US tariffs directly increase its domestic inflation, which lowers the competitiveness of US exports in the world market.
It is high time the Biden administration conducted an audit of the US' gains and losses from its faithful implementation of its predecessor's trade policy with China. Lifting the tariffs would serve all parties' interests. It would by no means be a condescending favor the US administration would grant China, but an overdue correction of its own mistakes.",IMPORT TRADE (90%); TARIFFS & DUTIES (90%); EXPORT TRADE (89%); PRICES (89%); TRADE DISPUTES (89%); AGRICULTURAL TRADE (78%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (77%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (77%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (76%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (76%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (76%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (76%); OUTPUT & DEMAND (76%); BUSINESS CLIMATE & CONDITIONS (75%); CONSUMERS (75%); INTERNATIONAL TRADE (75%); PRICE CHANGES (75%); PRICE INCREASES (75%); MANUFACTURING OUTPUT (74%); US PRESIDENTS (73%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (71%); ENERGY EXPORTS & IMPORTS (70%); EXPORT PRICES (69%); INFLATION (69%); STATISTICS (69%); NATIONAL SECURITY (61%)

BRICS countries should join hands to innovate in governance and tackle common challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic and alleviating poverty, experts said at a BRICS seminar.
Richard Levin, special master for labor tenants at the Land Claims Court in Randburg, South Africa, said at the BRICS Seminar on Governance and Cultural Exchange Forum 2020 that the COVID-19 pandemic has severely affected the world, and all countries need to make adjustments and work together to address global problems, such as poverty.
He added that China, South Africa and other African countries have always been committed to multilateralism and could play important roles in pushing forward the innovation of governance, and that he hopes BRICS countries－Brazil, Russia, India, China and South Africa－will gain larger voices in global governance.
Du Zhanyuan, president of China International Publishing Group, said that BRICS successfully evolved from a concept into an organization and it continues to develop, because BRICS countries represent emerging powers in the world. The countries have consistently put forward new ideas and solutions on major global issues from a new perspective to promote the development of global governance, Du said.
The BRICS mechanism is a product of innovation, he said, and should continue to be a source of innovation and play a more active role in leading the world out of difficulties.
Pavel Negoitsa, general director of the editorial office of the Rossiyskaya Gazeta newspaper, said that because of the COVID-19 pandemic, more people across the world will fall into poverty. China has made tremendous achievements in poverty alleviation in the past few decades and its experiences are worth learning from. He also suggested that BRICS countries hold a forum especially to share experiences of lifting people from poverty.
Cultural exchanges
People-to-people and cultural exchanges are also critical to BRICS countries. Chinese film director Lu Chuan previously organized the filming of Kids and Glory, the first documentary jointly produced and broadcast by BRICS countries. He said the film has been a cultural product and popular art form with people of all countries, and it could serve as an ambassador in international cultural exchanges.
Lu expected to make more jointly produced documentaries among BRICS countries in the future on a wide range of topics, including music, history, and literature.
More than 150 participants from BRICS countries participated in the seminar and forum on Thursday and Friday.

Marking a fresh effort to help the region recover from the COVID-19 pandemic, the leaders of China and the Association of Southeast Asian Nations agreed on Tuesday to deepen cooperation in various fields, including public health, economic integration and the early implementation of the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership agreement.
The joint statement issued by Premier Li Keqiang and the leaders of the ASEAN countries following their virtual summit will serve as a blueprint for the two sides to strengthen their all-round cooperation in the post-pandemic era to promote the economic recovery and development of the region.
The leaders also agreed to promote the China-ASEAN Free Trade Agreement and explore broader mutual opening up in other areas such as the digital economy. They stressed the needs to strengthen cooperation to enhance the connectivity and resilience of supply chains in the region by exploring ""the development of economic corridors, as well as economic, trade, and industrial parks"".
These initiatives will no doubt deepen the horizon of their mutually beneficial cooperation and thus pave the way for their partnership to continue to grow and thrive.
Since the COVID-19 pandemic broke out, China and the ASEAN countries have set a good example in jointly fighting the pandemic and helping each other. Instead of being weakened by the pandemic, the bond between the two sides has only grown stronger along with their shared political will to deepen cooperation.
The development of their 30-year dialogue partnership has shown China is both a reliable partner and a conscientious friend that is committed to working with ASEAN to jointly usher in an even brighter future for the region and its people. Such a time-honored friendship can withstand the tests of the times and the attempts by others to drive a wedge between them.
Although the joint commitments they have announced paint a rosy picture of the future, the increasingly complicated challenges on the geopolitical front threaten to spoil it. With the United States intensifying the implementation of its Indo-Pacific strategy aimed at containing China's rise, the region has been increasingly turned into a venue for the US' strategic competition with China.
The current peaceful situation in the Asia-Pacific region needs to be cherished. Outside forces, such as the US, instead of stoking tensions and confrontation, should play a more constructive role in the region.
At a time when the world is confronted with various grave challenges, China and ASEAN, both staunch supporters of multilateralism and an open world economy, are shoring up the spirit of a community with a shared future, and in so doing injecting confidence that these challenges can be overcome with concerted efforts.",ASEAN COUNTRIES (94%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); AGREEMENTS (89%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (89%); EMERGING MARKETS (79%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (78%); NEW ECONOMY (78%); TRADE TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (78%); ECONOMIC RECOVERY (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (77%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (76%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (76%); FREE TRADE TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (75%); PARTNERSHIP AGREEMENTS (75%); INTERNATIONAL TRADE (73%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (71%); BUSINESS NEWS (70%); DIGITAL ECONOMY (70%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (70%); TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (70%)

The White House is pushing for the rollout of a COVID-19 vaccine on or before Nov 1. At the same time, it is trying to distract the American public from the devastation the novel coronavirus has wreaked in the United States.
The US administration's approaches are worrying many scholars and vaccine experts.
In an article published by US magazine Foreign Policy, Laurie Garrett, a former senior fellow for global health at the Council on Foreign Relations, wrote that she had no confidence that a safe and effective vaccine will be ready for use by Halloween.
""In its mad sprint to Election Day, the White House has funneled billions of dollars into drug companies and ordered government agencies to execute their public health duties at breakneck speeds that defy credulity,"" Garrett said.
She said the timetable is simply too short for full safety analysis of any vaccine.
The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention notified states to be ready to distribute one to high-priority groups as soon as Nov 1－two days before the presidential election.
But none of the more than 150 vaccines in the research pipeline worldwide have completed phase 3 safety and efficacy clinical trials, Garrett said.
The CDC deadline has fueled concerns among Democrats and some health officials of political pressures to fast-track vaccine approval at the expense of public safety.
Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement on Thursday the public should be cautious the administration of US President Donald Trump may influence the Food and Drug Administration's decision to approve a COVID-19 vaccine earlier than is safe for political gain.
Politicizing effort
In early August, 417 vaccine experts sent a letter to FDA chief Stephen Hahn, expressing concern that Operation Warp Speed－the Trump administration's multibillion-dollar vaccine campaign－was overly politicizing the effort and corners might be cut in safety and efficacy screening.
Others have noted that release of a poorly effective or side effects-inducing COVID vaccine risks permanently eroding public trust in the entire process, leading to the populace's refusal to immunize.
Nine vaccine makers－Pfizer, Merck, AstraZeneca, Sanofi, GlaxoSmithKline, BioNTech, Johnson &Johnson, Moderna, and Novavax－followed suit, issuing their own public pledge not to seek government approval without extensive safety and effectiveness data on Tuesday, according to US health news website Stat.
The White House has refused to join in international cooperation on vaccines.
On Aug 24, World Health Organization's Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said in Geneva that a 172-nation commitment, the COVID-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility is aiming to hasten collaboration worldwide for creation of a vaccine for all of humanity. ""Our only way out of this pandemic is together,"" Tedros said.
But the White House announced on Sept 2 that the US will refuse to join in, or cooperate with, COVAX. ""The United States will continue to engage our international partners to ensure we defeat this virus, but we will not be constrained by multilateral organizations influenced by the corrupt World Health Organization and China,"" said White House spokesman Judd Deere.
The WHO solidarity effort argued in an editorial published in The Lancet in August that a weakly effective vaccine could actually worsen the pandemic if it induced authorities to relax control measures, such as mask-wearing, or if vaccinated people believed they were immune and increased their risk-taking behavior.
Premature approvals
Many vaccine veterans worry that political forces－the US presidential election, nationalistic pride to ""win"" a race and the need to resuscitate economies－could lead to premature and dangerous approvals under mechanisms such as the emergency use authorization, a pathway used by the US to allow rapid access to diagnostics, treatments and vaccines, according to Science magazine.
The White House's top health officials and advisers last week adamantly insisted political motivations won't play into timeline for coronavirus vaccine.
But US officials are continuing to politicize the pandemic. In a State Department tweet on Sunday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo pointed the finger at China for the virus.
In a tweet responding to Pompeo's remarks, Michael Swaine, senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace in Washington DC, said: ""Here is a clear example of the use of COVID 2 try to distract the US public from the real source of the devastation the virus has wreaked in the US: Trump and self-deluded Americans who think that individual liberty justifies a callous disregard for the safety of others. Pathetic.""
The US has seen 6,222,974 COVID-19 cases and 188,003 deaths as of Tuesday, according to the World Health Organization.

In stark contrast to the volatile economic situation in some major economies, the data bode well for the world's second-largest economy maintaining its recovery curve in the fourth quarter of this year and beyond, reflecting the Chinese economy's capacity to quickly rectify a temporary deviation from its growth course and fend off the spillover effects of an international geopolitical crisis.
That China's gross domestic product increased 3.9 percent in the third quarter year-on-year, a marked rebound from the 0.4 percent growth in the second quarter, reflects the robust recovery momentum and resilience of the national economy.
Although it remains lower than the 4.8 percent growth in the first quarter, it means that the economy grew 3 percent in the first three quarters. With the recent reemergence of the novel coronavirus now under control in most parts of the country, the sharp fall in economic growth has not only been arrested, the economy has rapidly picked up again.
That is a hard-earned result given the complex and severe domestic and international situation and the impact of the multiple unexpected factors the country has faced. One that can be attributed to the arduous efforts governments at various levels have made to faithfully implement the pro-growth policies of the central authorities, which adhere to the general principle of seeking progress while maintaining stability and effectively coordinating epidemic prevention and control with economic and social development.
With the COVID-19 pandemic pressure having eased, the prospects for the fourth quarter look more optimistic as market demand has improved, employment and commodity prices remain stable on the whole - the consumer price index rose 2 percent in the first three quarters and people's disposable income increased by 3.2 percent.
This has created more favorable conditions for the country to pursue high-quality development.
With its strong and stable fundamentals, the Chinese economy will remain on a positive trajectory over the long run, General Secretary of the Communist Party of China Central Committee Xi Jinping said when he led out the new members of the Party's top leadership body to meet the media on Sunday, stressing that the Chinese economy has great resilience, potential and latitude.
The accelerating pace of the recovery of the service sector, which rose 2.3 percent in the first three quarters, 0.5 percentage points higher than that in the first half of this year, and consumption, which surged 0.7 percent in the first three quarters, compared with a 0.7 percent drop in the first half, point to the slow-but-sure recovery momentum, and future growth potential, of the economy.
On the whole, the major indicators have returned to stability and remain within a reasonable range, and positive factors have increased, with grain output, industrial production and investment in fixed assets increasing by 3.8 percent, 3.9 percent and 5.9 percent respectively over the first three quarters.
But with the external environment becoming more complex and severe, and the foundation for domestic economic recovery still not solid, it is important that the government continue to be proactive in its policies.","ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (92%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (91%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (90%); EMERGING MARKETS (90%); OUTPUT & DEMAND (89%); QUALITY CONTROL (89%); COMMUNISM (79%); AGRICULTURAL OUTPUT (78%); BUSINESS NEWS (78%); COMMODITIES MARKETS (78%); CONSUMER PRICE INDEX (78%); ECONOMIC DECLINE (78%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (78%); GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (78%); PRICES (78%); RETAIL PRICES (78%); SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLE (78%); ECONOMIC NEWS (77%); STATISTICS (77%); MANUFACTURING OUTPUT (76%); NEGATIVE NEWS (76%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (73%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (73%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (73%); EPIDEMICS (73%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (73%); PANDEMICS (73%); AGRICULTURAL COMMODITIES MARKETS (68%); CORONAVIRUSES (68%); VIRUSES (68%); ARRESTS (67%); POLITICAL PARTIES (65%); COMMODITIES PRICES (63%); DISPOSABLE INCOME (50%)"

After two days of talks, the G20 health ministers issued their ""Pact of Rome"", which in pledging to help vulnerable populations in poor countries showcased precious, and hitherto scarce, solidarity in the global fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite the absence of specific financial commitments, the joint communique they produced conveyed a desperately needed message of cooperation, solidarity and justice.
As Director-General of the World Health Organization Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told the Rome meeting, although more than 5 billion jabs have been administered worldwide, many countries are still experiencing dramatic increases in their rates of infections and rising death tolls, because 75 percent of the vaccine doses have been administered in just 10 countries. In Africa, the vaccination rate is only 2 percent.
This is not just a simple matter of political or moral correctness. When the entire world is struggling with the undersupply of COVID-19 vaccines, and the available doses are distributed not in accordance with need, any stated ambition for a coordinated global response will be merely empty talk.
Even the most vaccinated populations in developed countries remain vulnerable, with incessant upticks in infections being reported. This is a stark reminder that there is no reliable way of self-protection except significantly ramping up collective defense through international cooperation. The G20 health ministers' consensus on joint actions hopefully signals this incontrovertible fact has been taken to heart.
In spite of the many stern warnings from experts that advanced countries' self-centered hoarding of vaccines would end up impeding the global campaign against the pandemic and hurting themselves, they have persisted with this practice, depriving some of the most needy nations, mostly poor ones, of due access to the crucial antigens.
Belated as it is, the awareness of the significance of a coordinated response in the face of such a global crisis will prove invaluable if it is translated into concrete actions. That means the political commitment has to be matched with financial ones, and ultimately actual contributions to achieve the anticipated outcomes.
Both the fair distribution of vaccines in poor countries and the proposal to boost their own vaccine production capacities entail substantial financial inputs, especially if the G20 aspires to fulfill the WHO goal to have 40 percent of the global population inoculated by the end of 2021. The October G20 health and finance ministers' meeting will therefore be significant, as it will determine to what extent the political rhetoric will translate into tangible outcomes.

Whether in response to climate change and the COVID-19 pandemic or promoting a recovery of the global economy, multilateralism is a prerequisite. Addressing these challenges is a nonstarter if all countries have their own calculations based purely on their own interests.
Unilateralism is the reason why there has been so much foot-dragging in global endeavors to effectively cut greenhouse emissions and contain the global temperature rise and for the failure to keep the COVID-19 pandemic globally at bay.
The whole is greater than the sum of its parts. Developed countries in particular should shoulder their due responsibilities for their historical greenhouse gas emissions. Not only doing whatever they can to cut their own emissions but also helping developing countries to achieve their goals. Their aid in both funds and technologies is essential for substantial progress in containing climate change.
Shifting from fossil fuels to renewable energy and reducing consumption of energy through technology upgrading will not only make development more sustainable but also further the quality of economic growth.
China's development trajectory sets a good example for this green transition.
Its carbon intensity in 2020 was 18.8 percent lower than that in 2015, a better result than the target set in the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20). The figure was also 48.4 percent less than that in 2005, which means that the country has more than fulfilled its commitment to the international community — to achieve a 40-45 percent reduction in carbon intensity from the 2005 level by 2020. The drop in carbon intensity translates to a total reduction of about 5.8 billion metric tons of carbon dioxide emissions from 2005 to 2020.
This means China has largely reversed the rapid growth of its carbon dioxide emissions.
At the same time, its economy has achieved leapfrog development. Its GDP in 2020 was more than four times bigger than in 2005. It has lifted nearly 100 million rural poor people out of poverty during this period, and succeeded in realizing the goal of eliminating absolute poverty.
So when President Xi Jinping put forward three suggestions in a written statement for the World Leaders Summit of the 26th session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change — which can be summarized as upholding multilateralism, focusing on concrete actions and accelerating the green transition — it was based on China's successful practice and what it has achieved.
To build on these achievements, the country has a clearly defined timetable, road map and blueprint to realize its carbon peak and carbon neutrality goals. Guided by the vision of a community of life for man and nature, the country will take stronger actions to pursue a green and low-carbon path to development.
If all countries shelve their differences and uphold multilateralism and take concrete actions to advance the green transition, there may yet be hope that humanity can overcome the climate challenge.",CLIMATE CHANGE (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); EMISSIONS (90%); GREENHOUSE GASES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (90%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (89%); GREEN BUILDING (89%); EMERGING MARKETS (79%); CARBON NEUTRAL INITIATIVES (78%); GLOBAL WARMING (78%); GLOBALIZATION (78%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (77%); ECONOMIC RECOVERY (77%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (77%); GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT (77%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (77%); NEGATIVE NEWS (77%); DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (74%); CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICY (73%); ENVIRONMENTAL TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (73%); UNITED NATIONS (73%); BUSINESS NEWS (72%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (65%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (60%)

The signing of a land pre-purchase agreement between China's Contemporary Amperex Technology Company and the city of Debrecen in Hungary on Monday marks the official launch of the world's top car battery producer's 221-hectare Hungarian plant valued at around 7.34 billion euros ($7.28 billion).
The project, whose construction is scheduled to start this year and be completed within five and a half years, is the largest investment in Hungary's history. The factory, the CATL's second in Europe after one in Germany, is expected to create 9,000 new jobs, and contribute to Hungary's commitment to achieving carbon neutrality by 2050.
Moreover, the landmark project will help strengthen CATL's foothold in Europe given that its customers include major carmakers such as Mercedes-Benz, BMW and Volkswagen. The factory's production capacity of 100 GWh will also cement CATL's dominant position in the global car battery ecosystem, as the world needs battery manufacturing capacity of 1,000 GWh annually by 2025 to meet the target for electric vehicle transition, according to the International Energy Agency.
The project is the fruit of many years of pragmatic Sino-Hungarian cooperation based on mutual respect and Hungary's desire to be the base for Chinese companies in Europe and the main transit route for Chinese goods intended for the European market.
Thanks to its ""opening to the East"" policy, Hungary has always seen China as an important partner for its own development. It seeks to be the gateway for Chinese investors expanding their presence in Europe, and in 2015 it was the first European country to embrace China's Belt and Road Initiative.
China is now Hungary's largest trading partner outside of the European Union, and Hungary is China's third-largest trading partner among Central and Eastern European countries. The close economic and trade relations have enabled both countries to support each other in areas that go far beyond economic cooperation and trade.
At the height of the COVID-19 pandemic last year, China delivered millions of doses of vaccines as well as face masks and other medical equipment to Hungary to help it through the difficult time. And Hungary stood up against the EU in March 2021 when the bloc imposed sanctions on China for alleged human rights violations, calling the move ""pointless, pretentious and harmful"".
With the EU reappraising China as ""a competitor, even a rival"", the good relations between Hungary and China are viewed warily in Brussels. But the goal of China-Hungary cooperation has never been to divide Europe, rather to promote mutual understanding between China and Europe.

The 18th China-ASEAN Expo and China-ASEAN Business and Investment Summit that opened in Nanning, capital of South China's Guangxi Zhuang autonomous region on Friday, clearly display the vitality and resilience of the regional market.
Inaugurated in 2004, the annual expo is an important platform for promoting trade and bilateral relations between China and the ASEAN countries.
This year's expo — and a series of related events — highlights that over the years, China and the members of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations have forged increasingly fruitful trade ties.
A total of 179 deals worth more than 300 billion yuan (about $46.59 billion), the highest ever, were signed on the first day of the expo, testifying to the great potential and appeal of the annual event to regional businesses.
The expo is undoubtedly an important venue for the two sides to grasp new opportunities, but it also serves as a showcase for the bright prospects for the building of a China-ASEAN community with a shared future.
Held against the backdrop of the raging COVID-19 pandemic and amid the celebrations for the 30th anniversary of the establishment of dialogue relations between ASEAN and China, this year's gala is of special significance in this respect.
The global health crisis and ensuing economic challenges have prompted China and ASEAN to join hands even tighter in order to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic and promote the region's post-pandemic recovery.
Despite the contracting global trade and economic recession, the two sides became each other's largest trading partners for the first time last year. Data from the Chinese customs shows trade between China and ASEAN rose from $8.36 billion in 1991 to $685.28 billion in 2020, with an average annual growth rate of 16.5 percent.
This encouraging picture shows how their long-standing shared resolve to work together through thick and thin is producing real benefits for both sides.
Thanks to their joint efforts to continuously tap the potential in their complementary economies and deepen all-round cooperation, the tree of China-ASEAN friendship continues to flourish, growing taller and greener, which is also a blessing for the rest of Asia and indeed the world as a whole, since a reliable driver to promote global development and prosperity is of the essence.
China and ASEAN, which are both staunch supporters of multilateralism and an open world economy, can work together to be a powerful catalyst for a sustainable global recovery. And with their long-horizon strategic vision, they can help the region heighten its standing and gain more clout in world affairs, contributing to the building of a multipolar world.",

The world is once again at a historical crossroad. But if countries are convinced that the trends of the times are irresistible, they will be able to choose the path of peace and development.
That's the message President Xi Jinping sought to drive home in the speech he made, via video link, at the General Debate of the 76th Session of the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday.
In the speech, President Xi put forward a series of new proposals and measures pertinent to addressing global challenges such as the COVID-19 pandemic, the deficits in global governance and climate change.
His speech pointed the way for the world to chart the course to stand on the right side of history. The stronger the headwind the international community faces in its efforts to build a community with a shared future, the more countries should consolidate their belief in the overall trend of history.
While many countries have been waiting to see whether there will be a thaw in the current chill in Sino-US relations, which has been instigated by Washington, the top leader of China has made it unequivocally clear that China on its part will continue to support world peace and development, and actively shoulder its responsibilities to respond to the challenges facing the world.
The pandemic has widened the development gap between the North and South and made the issues of food security and sustainable development acute, particularly for poorer countries.
Based on China's experience and its fruitful interactions with the world, President Xi proposed that development should always be prioritized, and multilateral coordination is essential to ensure that it is more inclusive, innovation-driven and friendly to nature.
Stressing that development should also be people-centered, he said that special efforts should be made to address poverty, hunger and the COVID-19 vaccine shortage, and to promote green development, industrialization, digital economy and connectivity. Rather than a world at odds due to hegemony, unilateralism and zero-sum games, he called on all countries to adhere to the United Nations Charter and its principles, and let the UN be the center of international relations.
Every country needs to show confidence, courage and responsibility to make the correct historical choices. As it embarks on the next stage of its development journey, China will create new opportunities for the world. This is a historic choice China has made, and it is also China's commitment and responsibility to the world.
The proposals President Xi has made once again demonstrate that China is a builder of world peace, a contributor to global development, a defender of the international order, and a provider of public goods.",INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (90%); TRENDS (90%); UNITED NATIONS (90%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (90%); SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT (89%); NEGATIVE NEWS (88%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (77%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (73%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (73%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (73%); PANDEMICS (73%); GREEN BUILDING (72%); VACCINES (70%); SUSTAINABILITY (68%); HUNGER IN SOCIETY (67%); FOOD SECURITY (63%); DIGITAL ECONOMY (61%); DRUG SHORTAGES (50%); POVERTY & HOMELESSNESS (50%)

Considering the generally tense relations between Beijing and Washington over the past few years, countries in Southeast Asia have every reason to care about whether and how China and the US interact at the ongoing three-day series of Association of Southeast Asian Nations meetings, and also how each of them engages with ASEAN.
That US President Joe Biden joined Southeast Asian leaders for a virtual summit on Tuesday, the first time in four years that a US president has participated in a meeting with the 10-nation group, was no doubt a sign of the importance the current US administration attaches to it. The ASEAN countries are a crucial part of Washington's envisioned Indo-Pacific strategy, as well as being integral to its supply chain restructuring agenda, a promising market, and a geopolitical bridgehead.
Washington is undoubtedly taking advantage of the meetings to try and draw Southeast Asian nations closer to itself and away from China, as many have observed. So along with the now familiar rhetoric, Biden also came with carrots. His essentially coalition-building appeal reportedly sweetened with a $102 million gift package to enhance the US-ASEAN partnership, together with Biden's pledges on cooperation on supply-chain resilience, climate, and ""common challenges on maritime issues"".
Yet there was little said on how the White House will deliver when it comes to trade, investment, and infrastructure, nor on how it plans to fulfill its promise to provide COVID-19 vaccines to the region. The US-led Quad pledged in March to provide 1 billion COVID-19 vaccines to Southeast Asian countries by the end of 2022, but little has been done to honor that pledge.
Unlike Washington, Beijing does not treat its relations with the ASEAN members as a mere geopolitical expedient. The friendly ties it has cultivated with countries in the region are solid and have stood the tests of time, and they have been strengthened with practical support and cooperation. ASEAN became China's largest trading partner in the first half of 2021 taking the place of the European Union. And Beijing and the ASEAN members have agreed on the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership, ASEAN-China FTA, and are seeking to expedite negotiations for the conclusion of the Code of Conduct in the South China Sea.
ASEAN was founded in 1967 by Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore and Thailand with the aim of promoting stability in the region during the Vietnam War, a hot war of the Cold War that was spilling into neighboring countries.
The legacy of this is the regional countries' wariness of once again being the victims of the US' power plays. With the US increasingly trying to sow the seeds of division in the region and stir up trouble, the Biden administration is going to have its work cut out convincing the ASEAN members that they do not risk being used and abused like Afghanistan if they become party to Washington's mischief-making.","ASEAN COUNTRIES (94%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (90%); US PRESIDENTS (90%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (89%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL TRADE (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (78%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (75%); EUROPEAN UNION (73%); FREE TRADE TREATIES & AGREEMENTS (73%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (67%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (67%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (67%); VACCINES (66%); VIETNAM WAR (60%)

On July 1, President Xi Jinping announced that China had realized its goal of building a xiaokang society in all respects.
Literally, that means ""small well-being"" society, and Xi's announcement signaled that China has built a moderately prosperous society in all respects.
But what does that mean?
The white paper released by the State Council Information Office on Tuesday elaborates. It points out that with nearly 20 percent of the world's population, whether China fares well or badly has a bearing on the overall situation of the entire world.
With China eliminating the last vestiges of absolute poverty in the country at the end of last year, 770 million rural residents have been lifted out of poverty over the past four decades, accounting for 70 percent of the world total lifted out of poverty during that period.
So what if China's economy crashed and China needed global aid to keep that population alive? With only about 9 percent of the world's arable land, China's success in its rural development and economic growth has enabled it to feed nearly 20 percent of the world's population.
Think about what that means. If the country's agricultural output fell short of its needs by a large margin, what would happen to the global grain market?
Countries have many reasons to welcome China's attainment of its goal of building a moderately prosperous society in all respects.
It is China's efforts to build a xiaokang society that enabled it to pull the world economy from the global financial crisis in 2008.
China is also the first country that has largely kept the novel coronavirus under control and reopened its economy since the COVID-19 pandemic swept throughout the world in 2020. China's quick restarting of its economic activities has not only sustained the development of the global economy, it has also enabled it to provide the entire world with a wide range of products necessary for the control and prevention of the pandemic worldwide.
It is obvious that the world would have suffered much more from the COVID-19 pandemic without the support of various kinds provided by China. Many countries would not have enough face masks to help keep their people safe from the virus had China's manufacturing industry not been able to get swiftly back on its feet.
It is because it has realized the building of a xiaokang society that China has been not only able to provide what it has manufactured for the well-being of people worldwide, but also offer the opportunities of a large market to the world. An increasingly prosperous China will benefit the world in many ways.

Despite its acknowledgment that the novel coronavirus was not developed as a biological weapon, and that Chinese officials did not have foreknowledge of SARS-CoV-2 before the outbreak was identified, the US intelligence report on the origins of the novel coronavirus still maintains there is the possibility of the virus leaking from a lab.
What is funny about the report is the fact that the entire world, including those involved in the task, knows that the mission is one for scientists to undertake not secret service agents.
The whole world knows what the US is doing, and the US knows that the entire world is clear about what its intelligence agencies are trying to achieve — to gather whatever they can grab as evidence to incriminate China for what the US has already deemed it is guilty of.
What is funnier is the fact that the entire world is also aware of what a bad job the US has done in containing the spread of the virus from the very beginning. Instead of doing what it should do by reflecting on the missteps and the mistakes it has made in planning its overall endeavors to keep the virus at bay, Washington is trying to deflect the world from its own failed response to the COVID-19 pandemic.
With the largest number of infections and the highest death toll among all countries, and also as one of the major sources for the spread of the virus to many other parts of the world, the US owes the international community an apology for its own responsibility in making the global pandemic what it is today.
However, for some US politicians, tracing of the virus is considered a magic wand that they believe will help them kill two birds with one stone. One is to shift the blame onto China as the origins of the virus, and another is to contain the rise of China, with the world forced to acknowledge China should bear sole responsibility for the pandemic.
Yet everyone knows full well that this is anything but the truth. The further the US goes down this road, the more humiliation it will suffer. The more the US tries to peddle its conspiracy theories against China, which has done a great job in largely keeping the virus at bay, the more the US will expose itself as a world power which has failed to fulfill its due responsibility in leading the global fight against the virus.
The only way the US can save face is to acknowledge its failure in its response to COVID-19, stop deflecting the blame for its own woes onto others, and contribute to global solidarity in the fight against the virus by allowing origins tracing to be conducted on its own territory.",

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, geopolitical crises such as the Russia-Ukraine conflict and particularly the United States' protectionist and unilateralist interversion in world trade, the global industry and supply chains are facing unprecedented challenges, which have led to high commodity prices and bare shelves in some countries.
Economists believe that the supply shocks could knock 4 to 5 percent off global production in the next year or two, thus hindering the global recovery.
Maintaining the resilience and stability of global industry and supply chains is an important guarantee for world economic development and serves the common interests of people around the world.
China firmly upholds the public goods nature of the global industry and supply chains, seeks to secure the stability of its own industry and supply chains and takes concrete actions to deepen international cooperation to maintain the stability of the global industry and supply chains.
To that end, a three-day International Forum on Resilient and Stable Industry and Supply Chains opened in Hangzhou, capital of Zhejiang province, on Monday. Proposed by President Xi Jinping last year, the forum provides countries with a platform for concerted efforts to keep the global industry and supply chains safe and stable and ensure the smooth functioning of the world economy.
Global industry insiders can take advantage of the event to boost their exchanges and cooperation and so lay a solid foundation for building greater resilience in the global industry and supply chains.
As Xi said in his congratulatory message to the forum, the international community should pool its efforts to jointly build global industry and supply chains which are secure, stable, unimpeded, efficient, open, inclusive and mutually beneficial, so as to contribute to the global economic cycle, boost world economic growth and improve the well-being of people around the world.
Given the pivotal role that China plays in the global industry and supply chains, how well it can tackle the current difficulties and restore growth by ensuring normal industrial production and free flow of goods will have a direct bearing on the global economy.
China has already done its utmost to stabilize the global industry and supply chains. For example, Yiwu, the world's largest small commodity distribution center, has spared no efforts to ensure the smooth operation of the Yiwu-Xinjiang-Europe freight train. More than 1,000 China-Europe freight trains have departed from the city in Zhejiang so far this year, a year-on-year increase of over 15 percent.
In his message, Xi also said that China is ready to work with other countries to seize the new opportunities of the new round of scientific and technological revolution and industrial transformation, and that China's development will provide more market opportunities and development space for enterprises from all countries.
With its production and supply chains remaining stable and resilient, China will continue to be the ballast for the recovery of the global economy.",BUSINESS NEWS (90%); ECONOMIC CONDITIONS (90%); ECONOMIC RECOVERY (90%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (90%); EMERGING MARKETS (90%); ECONOMIC NEWS (89%); SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT (89%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (78%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (78%); GLOBALIZATION (78%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (78%); COMMODITIES MARKETS (77%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (77%); ECONOMIC GROWTH (77%); ECONOMIC STIMULUS (77%); ECONOMICS (77%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (77%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (77%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (77%); INTERNATIONAL TRADE (77%); MANUFACTURING OUTPUT (77%); PROTECTIONISM (77%); TALKS & MEETINGS (76%); RUSSIA-UKRAINE CONFLICTS (73%); COMMODITIES PRICES (71%); BUSINESS REPORTS & FORECASTS (50%)

Four peer reviews published by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology refute a study that asserts the virus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic was created by intentional genetic manipulation in China.
All four published peer reviews found that the study has ""serious flaws and errors in the methods and data"" that render its conclusions ""misinformative"".
The study, released on Sept 14, implicates numerous research groups in contributing to the pandemic and calls for ""an independent investigation into the relevant research laboratories"".
The research was conducted by Li-Meng Yan, who claims to be a former researcher at the Hong Kong School of Public Health, as well as Shu Kang, Jie Guan and Shanchang Hu.
Shortly after the study was released, Rapid Reviews: COVID-19, a journal that seeks to accelerate peer review of COVID-19-related research preprints under the MIT Press, one of the largest and most distinguished university presses and a leading publisher, published four peer reviews of the study.
The journal sought peer reviews from world-renowned experts in virology, molecular biology, structural biology, computational biology, vaccine development and medicine.
An editorial statement in the journal said that reviewers have collectively debunked three claims in the ""Yan Report"": bat coronaviruses were used as a background strain to engineer SARS-CoV-2; evidence suggests prior screening for a virus targeting the human ACE2 receptor; and the fur-in-like cleavage site is unnatural and provides evidence of engineering.
""There was a general consensus that the study's claims were better explained by potential political motivations rather than scientific integrity. The peer reviewers arrived at these common opinions independently, further strengthening the credibility of the peer reviews,"" said the editorial.
Insufficient evidence
One of the peer reviews was by Takahiko Koyama of the IBM Research Computational Biology Center in Yorktown Heights, New York. He concluded that ""the manuscript does not demonstrate sufficient scientific evidences to support genetic manipulation origin of SARS-CoV-2"".
The peer review by Adam Lauring, from the University of Michigan Internal Medicine Department, said the authors of the report ""don't contest the natural origin hypothesis with data. Instead, they offer ideas and opinions"".
He also questioned the background of the research.
""A key aspect of research ethics and the responsible conduct of research is to include information on who supported the work－financially or otherwise. The authors' affiliation is the Rule of Law Society and the Rule of Law Foundation. It is not clear who supports this foundation or what its purpose is,"" wrote Lauring. ""It is also unethical to promote what are essentially conspiracy theories that are not founded in fact.""
Reviewer Marvin Reitz from the University of Maryland Biotechnology Institute said: ""My opinion is that this is an inept attempt to make the case the virus was man-made. There are no concrete facts in this report. I do wonder why this is coming out now.""

In a statement released after the world passed the ""agonizing milestone"" of 1 million COVID-19 fatalities, United Nations Secretary-General António Guterres, gave a reminder of the human heartache behind this ""mind-numbing figure"".
""They were fathers and mothers, wives and husbands, brothers and sisters, friends and colleagues,"" he said, noting that the universal custom of mourning and celebrating the lives of those who had died was often impossible because of the risk of infection.
That he had to issue what was in effect a call for empathy is a sad indictment of the science-denying actions of some governments and individuals. Actions that mean there is still no end in sight to the devastating public health crisis and the upheaval it has caused.
The number of deaths and infections, more than 33 million people having been infected with the novel coronavirus worldwide, are mind-blowing. Yet at a regular news briefing on Monday, the World Health Organization warned current statistics underestimated actual infections and deaths.
And there is an even more worrying aspect to the story — there is no sign that the pandemic is abating.
In a number of countries, reports of infections keep increasing in stunning numbers. Even in the United States, where COVID-19 induced fatalities have crossed the 200,000 mark, substantial upticks are being reported in multiple states. Daily newly confirmed cases continue to hover above 40,000 from time to time in the US, prompting the US' leading infectious diseases expert Dr Anthony Fauci to warn about potential rise in fatalities as the annual influenza season approaches.
Sadly, responses to the public health crisis continue to be inadequate. At the government level, despite the WHO's insistence that countries show more solidarity, politicizing the pandemic and passing the buck for its spread have to a great extent dominated the international discourse on the still unfolding crisis. This has shattered hopes for effective international coordination and cooperation. More outrageous still has been some politicians' refusal to adopt science-based professional advice on how to contain the epidemic, which has already resulted in the loss of human lives that should and could have been avoided.
On the individual level, we have witnessed continuous disregard and denial of the severity of the state of affairs by some who remain convinced the pandemic is a hoax or regard the containment measures intended to save lives as restrictions on their personal liberty. Their refusal to wear masks and socially distance, which are proven ways to limit the spread of the virus, makes them accomplices of the deadly disease.
Politicization has greatly damaged the image and persuasiveness of the WHO as the global public health watchdog, leading to some of its critical warnings falling on deaf ears. But facts have proven the science deniers wrong.
The WHO has again sounded alarm, warning it is ""not impossible"" for the COVID-19 death toll to double before safe and reliable vaccines become available if countries do not work together to contain the virus.",DEATH & DYING (91%); PUBLIC HEALTH (91%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (90%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); EPIDEMICS (89%); NEGATIVE NEWS (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); DEATH RATES (78%); VIRUSES (78%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (77%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (77%); UNITED NATIONS (77%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (76%); CORONAVIRUSES (75%); DISEASE REPORTING (75%); INFLUENZA (75%); ELECTIONS & POLITICS (74%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (70%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (52%)

Chinese State Councilor and Foreign Minister Wang Yi was reassured by his hosts in Vietnam and Cambodia over the weekend that countries from outside the region will not be allowed to butt into regional affairs. This will be a bitter pill for Washington to swallow, as senior US officials have paid multiple visits to the region, including Vietnam and Singapore, over the past three months, in a bid to drive a wedge between China and countries in the region.
The strategists in Washington have to face the reality that the United States' so-called value diplomacy is unaccustomed to the climate and soil of Southeast Asia and East Asia, where the people share cultural values that China was a major historical cradle for. And it is clear to all which country is promoting peace and prosperity and which country is the stormy petrel.
No matter how many military bases the US has in the region, it cannot deny that these legacies of World War II and the Cold War are not bedrocks for regional peace and stability, but tools to maintain its hegemony in the region. Countries in Asia know that true security comes not from having the biggest guard dogs but from making friends.
It is China, not the US, that has boosted and sustained the collective development of economies in the region over the past few decades. It is also China that has played a pivotal role in helping the region respond to common challenges, ranging from the financial crises in 1998 and 2008 to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic.
Despite the US' desperate attempts to isolate China from other countries in Asia, China's status as the largest trade partner of, and major investor in, most of the countries in the region has only been consolidated thanks to the complementarity of their economies and their common interests in advancing regional integration.
Although there are some territorial disputes between China and some of the countries in the region, many of which are historical problems intentionally left to fester by the US, they have never hampered the continuous regional integration as the disputing parties have demonstrated the wisdom and ability to manage the disputes.
The more the US tries to hype up these historical issues, the more it reveals its true colors as a troublemaker to the region and the world.
Wang's visits to Vietnam, Cambodia, Singapore and the Republic of Korea, all neighbors and important partners of China, from Friday to Wednesday, reflect the great significance China attaches to improving its ties and deepening its cooperation with them during these difficult times when the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic are still being felt.
The stable and prosperous relations between China and the regional countries are supported by the three pillars of similar culture, broad common interests and joint security. And these pillars will only be fortified as regional countries strengthen their cooperation to boost pandemic prevention and control, and promote the region's economic recovery.",

In a sign that China's economy is recovering well from the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the country's total foreign trade, exports and imports all hit record highs in the first seven months of the year, with their respective year-on-year growth rates — at 24.5 percent, 24.5 percent and 24.4 percent — setting 10-year highs compared with the same period in previous years, according to data released by the General Administration of Customs on Tuesday.
The figures indicate that momentum in trade for the first half of the year continued into July, a trade volume of 3.27 trillion yuan ($505.72 billion) being recorded that month, the second-highest in history after that in June, according to the Ministry of Commerce. This bodes well for China's economic performance for the rest of the year.
The vibrancy in trade may come as a surprise to many, given the serious pandemic prevention and control measures still in force in the country, as sporadic infections are being reported in many places nationwide and the pressure of imported cases remains high. Not to mention the negative impacts on Chinese companies from the US-China trade war and the disruptions in global supply chains caused by tensions in their relations and COVID-19.
That China's foreign trade has beaten all odds to continue making headway results from many factors, ranging from the government's timely policy support and the resilience of Chinese enterprises, to the country's much improved trade structure that features exports of more sophisticated products. For example, driven by new-energy vehicles, automobile exports rose 102.5 percent, a record high compared with that for the same period in previous years.
Another noticeable point is the fact that trade with the United States, China's third-largest trading partner, rose 28.9 percent in the first seven months to reach 2.62 trillion yuan despite the higher tariffs the US government has imposed on Chinese goods and its sanctions on Chinese enterprises.
Which begs the question when will Washington end the lose-lose trade war it started and begin rebuilding a mutually beneficial and win-win trade relationship. US Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen has already admitted that the tariffs that remain in place have harmed US consumers. And in a letter sent to Yellen and US Trade Representative Katherine Tai last week, more than 30 major US business groups, from the agriculture to the semiconductor and pharmaceutical sectors, called on the White House to restart trade talks with China and cut import tariffs.
The robust Chinese trade performance will be a boon not only to China but the rest of the world as well, including the US.

President Xi Jinping will attend the 22nd meeting of the Council of Heads of State of the Shanghai Cooperation Organization in the Uzbek city of Samarkand while paying a state visit to Uzbekistan from Thursday to Friday.
The Chinese leader expressed his hopes that the organization can play a greater role in the region and beyond in a signed article carried by leading Uzbek media outlets on Tuesday.
""I am confident that with the joint efforts of all sides, the Samarkand Summit will produce fruitful outcomes and make a great contribution to building an even closer SCO community with a shared future and to the peace, stability, development and prosperity of our region,"" he wrote.
This year marks the 20th anniversary of the signing of the Charter of the SCO, and the Samarkand Summit is being held at a critical time when the region faces many challenges and uncertainties. The protracted COVID-19 pandemic, as well as heavily disrupted global industry and supply chains, the Russia-Ukraine conflict and climate change have created a perfect storm for the global economy, which is heading toward a recession. Which means that the SCO must play a more active role not only in upholding regional security and stability, but also in promoting development and prosperity.
During the summit, Iran is scheduled to sign a memorandum of obligations to pave the way for its accession to full SCO membership, while the SCO has also received a membership application from Belarus. Moreover, Saudi Arabia, Qatar and Egypt are scheduled to formally become SCO dialogue partners, and negotiations will be held on granting Cambodia, the Maldives and other countries the status of dialogue partner. The fast expanding influence of the SCO attests to the fact that the organization is viewed by the countries of the Silk Road Economic Belt as a vital safeguard for international norms and multilateralism.
Bringing together countries from different regions, at different stages of development, and from different civilizations and traditions, the SCO, which now accounts for about 80 percent of Eurasia's territory and 24 percent of the global GDP, is forging a strong collective. It is partnership characterized by non-alignment, dialogue and non-confrontation, and a practical vehicle for exploring the building of a new type of international relations and a community with a shared future for mankind. The SCO-Afghanistan Contact Group, for example, is playing a unique role in helping the country to restore peace and stability through development and political reconciliation.
As a regional organization encompassing the largest area and the largest population in the world today, and as a promoter of mutual learning, mutual trust, and mutual benefit, the SCO is also assuming the role of being a practical driver of development.

No matter what conclusion it draws, the classified US intelligence report just delivered to the White House will serve no meaningful purpose in furthering the understanding of the source of the novel coronavirus. Rather it will only further politicize a scientific issue and hamper international cooperation in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic.
US President Joe Biden ordered the country's intelligence agencies to conduct investigations into the origins of COVID-19 in May, and he reportedly received the report and a classified briefing about it on Tuesday. An unclassified summary will soon be released for the public.
That he entrusted intelligence officers, rather than scientists, to try to unravel the puzzle of the origin of the virus is revealing of what it will conclude. It obviously goes against basic scientific principles. But, more tellingly, the US intelligence agencies have a history of spreading disinformation and fabricating facts to serve the country's military or political interests — from the Gulf of Tonkin lie that sparked the Vietnam War in 1964 to the fake charge that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction used to topple Saddam Hussein in 2003. As Mike Pompeo, former director of the Central Intelligence Agency, admitted in a rare moment of honesty, the US is adept at such lying and cheating.
That's why China has stood firm and is pushing back against the US' politicizing of the origin tracing of the virus. The US report is simply a means to smear China and hype up the conspiracy theory that the virus leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. That a serious scientific and public health matter is being willfully manipulated by some US politicians to serve political ends is vile, beyond contempt.
The World Health Organization has already sent a team of experts to Wuhan, capital of Hubei province, to probe what might have triggered the pandemic. And in their analysis published in March, they described the possibility of a laboratory leak as ""extremely unlikely"". With no new evidence emerging, continuing to smear China with the unsubstantiated claim that the virus leaked from the lab and trying to cement that in the public's mind by pushing for another probe in Wuhan only serves to show that the US is up to its tricks again.
China does not oppose serious origin-tracing work. It has always actively cooperated with the international community in that regard. But it is justifiable for the country to say ""no"" to character assassination disguised as scientific research.
It is time Washington took the pandemic seriously as a public health threat rather than a way to try and discredit China. It should support scientists undertaking the task of identifying where and how the virus jumped to humans, especially because the window of opportunity for solving the virus mystery is ""closing fast"", as the WHO scientists have warned. It is an opportunity that must not be squandered as this is not the last pandemic that humans will face.

After four decades in which China's population has grown from over 950 million to 1.4 billion, the country's population growth is expected to be negative soon. Having grown by 2.04 million in 2020, it grew by only 480,000 in 2021, the lowest growth in 60 years.
While the continuing impacts of the COVID-19 epidemic may have been a factor that year, women's reluctance to have children has become an increasingly evident trend. The declining population growth will undoubtedly aggravate the problem of an aging population, and negatively impact economic and social development.
In a recent report, the National Health Commission said that the total fertility rate has dropped below 1.3 in recent years, and the country is expected to enter a stage of severe aging around 2035, with more than 30 percent of the population older than 60.
The government will need to direct more resources to the provision of health, medical and eldercare services to meet the demands of the increasingly elderly population.
A survey by the NHC in 2021 found that the heavy economic burden of raising a child, the lack of helping hands to take care of babies and the negative impact having a baby will have on their careers mean increasingly fewer women of childbearing age desire to have children.
The commission has called for improved public childcare services to encourage more women to have children. But there is a lot that governments at all levels can do so that women of childbearing age are willing to have children.
If the needs of women who have children are given enough consideration when framing policies related to housing, education, health, employment and social security it might encourage more women to consider starting a family or having another child.
The State Council, China's Cabinet, released the Decision to Optimize Policies for Balanced Development of the Population last year.
To implement the decision, various local governments have made policies according to their actual conditions to give subsidies to women who give birth, provide them with longer maternity leave or other parental benefits or introduced job protection measures for mothers.
Some of these measures will likely encourage more women to have a baby. But some of the policies are just perfunctory and do not really make things easier for mothers or prospective mothers due to poor implementation.
No matter how well-thought-out and well-intentioned such policies are, they also need to be firmly implemented.
And it is important for local authorities to bear in mind that whether they can do a good job in this regard will have a bearing on the stable development of the country's population.","POPULATION GROWTH (99%); AGING TRENDS (90%); CHILDREN, ADOLESCENTS & TEENS (90%); POPULATION & DEMOGRAPHICS (90%); POPULATION SIZE (90%); PREGNANCY & CHILDBIRTH (90%); INFANTS & TODDLERS (89%); WOMEN (89%); AGING (78%); FERTILITY RATES (78%); MATERNITY LEAVE (78%); POPULATION DECLINE (78%); NEGATIVE ECONOMIC NEWS (77%); PUBLIC HEALTH (77%); TRENDS (77%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (76%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (76%); PARENTING (76%); FAMILY (75%); ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT (74%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (74%); SENIOR CITIZENS (74%); CHILD CARE (73%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (72%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (71%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (71%); FERTILITY & INFERTILITY (70%); COMPENSATION & BENEFITS (69%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (69%); POLLS & SURVEYS (69%); CABINET OFFICES (67%)"

Thirty-seven residents were infected with the novel coronavirus during the process of getting a nucleic acid test in Yangzhou, Jiangsu province, on July 29. What a ridiculous and tragic incident! It bespeaks how disorganized the testing was.
The same thing happened to a 2-year-old boy who was infected with the virus while in a line for a nucleic acid test in Nanjing, capital of Jiangsu.
Nucleic acid tests are organized for all residents of a particular neighborhood, a district or even an entire city with a view to screening for possible infected patients or asymptomatic virus carriers when cases of COVID-19 are detected.
It is quite possible for those who have already been infected with the virus to be waiting to have their throat or nasal swab collected by nurses. It should therefore go without saying that measures must be taken to prevent virus carriers from spreading the virus to others when organizing such a test. When hundreds or even thousands of people gather together without keeping a safe distance from each other and proper hygiene procedures are not adhered to, it certainly offers an opportunity for the virus to infect as many people as it can.
Those local officials who have organized such testing without taking into consideration the risk of people carrying the virus passing it on to others during the testing should be held accountable and get their due punishment.
Having as many residents as possible get a nucleic acid test is absolutely imperative for detecting virus carriers and bringing the epidemic under control as early as possible.
Yet it should be a case of less haste, more speed.
The Delta variant is known to be highly transmissible, which has redefined close contacts of the infected. Those who have stayed in the same venue or even the same building with a person who carries the virus are designated as their close contacts and must be quarantined for 14 days before being confirmed as free from the virus.
As such, local governments should organize the nucleic acid testing in such a manner that the risk of virus carriers passing it to others is minimized to the greatest extent possible, while at the same time, the testing must be conducted as quickly as possible so that the virus carriers can be detected as early as possible.
In some localities, medical workers go down to neighborhoods to collect throat swabs building by building, and residents can stay at home waiting their turn, which has greatly reduced the chances of virus carriers spreading the virus to others.
What has happened in Yangzhou and Nanjing should serve as a reminder that details make the difference. Importance must be attached to every link in the fight against the pandemic to try and ensure there is no loophole the virus can exploit.",COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); VIRUSES (90%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (78%); SAFETY (78%); REGIONAL & LOCAL GOVERNMENTS (77%); NURSES & NURSING (73%); PUBLIC OFFICIALS (72%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (50%)

As most parts of the country enter the summer flood season, weather events will again put the country's disaster preparedness to test.
Some areas in the south of the country are experiencing what the National Meteorological Center calls the strongest rainfall in 60 years. Other parts of northwestern and central China, as well as the Yellow and Huaihe river valleys, have been in the grip of scorching heat waves.
On Sunday, the Ministry of Water Resources and the China Meteorological Administration issued the year's first red alert for flash floods. On Monday, the National Meteorological Center sustained red alerts for high temperatures, yellow alerts for storms and fog, and blue alerts for severe convective weather.
According to experts, this round of strong precipitation will be long-lasting, wide-ranging and of very strong intensity in some areas. The waters in 75 rivers across the country have already risen above the warning levels.
As the lessons from the past few years have taught us, climate change has considerably increased the frequency, intensity and damaging potential of extreme weather events. And, most worrisome of all, their severity has frequently caught people unawares.
The devastating potential of severe weather would still be beyond most people's imagination had it not been the 2021 floods that killed hundreds in Zhengzhou, capital of Henan province. The tragedy exposed the consequences of poor urban planning, inadequate drainage systems, slack disaster preparedness and slow emergency responses.
The importance of multi-hazard early warning systems and natural disaster response preparedness was highlighted in the sixth Assessment Report that the UN Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released in August 2021.
The report provided evidence that extreme hydrometeorological events, such as droughts, floods and heat waves, are increasing as is the severity of their impacts on everyday life around the globe as well as harming fragile ecosystems. It concludes that climate change is widespread, rapid and intensifying, and extreme weather will become more frequent.
The ""Opinions on Strengthening Integrating Efforts for Meteorological Early Warning and Emergency Response"" jointly published by the Ministry of Emergency Management and China Meteorological Administration are therefore timely, particularly considering local authorities' focus on the battle against the novel coronavirus.
While the COVID-19 pandemic remains an important priority for all public offices, it is of critical importance to make sure we are properly prepared and equipped against possible harm from disastrous weather conditions, which are more likely now than in cooler months.","WEATHER (93%); ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (90%); FLOODS & FLOODING (90%); METEOROLOGY (90%); NATURAL DISASTER ALERTS (90%); NATURAL DISASTERS (90%); NEGATIVE NEWS (90%); OCEANOGRAPHIC & ATMOSPHERIC SERVICES (90%); SEVERE WEATHER (90%); WEATHER ALERTS (90%); CLIMATE CHANGE (89%); DISASTER PLANNING (89%); EXTREME TEMPERATURES (89%); HEAT WAVES (89%); SAFETY, ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (89%); DISASTER RELIEF (78%); EMERGENCY SERVICES (78%); FRESHWATER ECOSYSTEMS (78%); ENVIRONMENTAL ACCIDENTS & DISASTERS (77%); DROUGHT (76%); WATER RESOURCES MANAGEMENT (76%); NATURAL RESOURCES (75%); WATER RESOURCES (75%); CLIMATE CHANGE REGULATION & POLICY (73%); ACCIDENTAL FATALITIES (72%); EMERGENCY MEDICAL SERVICES (69%); UNITED NATIONS (67%); EPIDEMICS (66%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (64%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (64%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (64%); CORONAVIRUSES (60%); PANDEMICS (60%); WATER QUALITY (55%); CITIES (50%); CITY GOVERNMENT (50%); CITY LIFE (50%); VIRUSES (50%)"

Despite almost 10 percent of the US population having been infected with the novel coronavirus, and more than 627,000 having died of COVID-19, it appears that the Joe Biden administration has decided it has no other ways to save lives apart from the vaccines.
The previous administration wasted a precious window of opportunity to contain the spread of the virus thanks to its stubborn anti-science stance. But the Biden administration is apparently not going to take any remedial measures for damage limitation.
Biden's predecessor, Donald Trump, seemed to believe that so long as he could deflect attention from his administration's inaction by diverting the public's anger onto China, he would be able to deflect any blame for its inept response to the pandemic onto Beijing. Now Biden is doing the same, and the more the situation worsens the more his administration is trying to smear China.
And all the core indicators, including daily infections, deaths and hospitalized cases, have rebounded abruptly over the past two weeks, indicating the situation is rapidly worsening.
That the Biden administration seems unable to prevent the return of the country's ""darkest days"" — despite the US having the most abundant supply of vaccines — can only be attributed to its own inability to make the difficult decision to mandate lockdowns where necessary and insist on the public's adherence to basic prevention and control measures such as wearing face masks and maintaining social distancing.
The Biden administration is wasting time in the fight against the Delta variant, and in doing so presenting the virus with an opportunity to run riot and mutate. It seems that the Biden administration does not feel the slightest shame for its failure to take the initiative. It appears resigned to the notion that if the vaccines cannot check the transmission of the virus, it can do nothing about it.
But in so doing, it is turning a blind eye to those other countries which are working hard to contain the Delta variant in the knowledge that not only will it save lives, but also it will help prevent new strains of the virus from emerging. These countries are not just relying on the vaccines, but have been diligently following the tried and tested way to cut transmission chains as quickly as possible. This means rigorous efforts are being made for the early detection of infections, and early quarantining and early treatment of those infected. It is the scientific approach, and it saves lives.
Were it not for the effects of the vaccines, the Biden administration would have made its callousness known to the world much earlier. And that is only reinforced by the fact that it has been parsimonious in supplying its surplus of COVID-19 vaccines to select countries and regions as condescending favors with strings attached.
For the Biden administration, the pandemic is neither a public health crisis nor a common enemy to humanity, but an opportunity to bad-mouth China as part of its coalition-building agenda that aims to isolate China from as much of the international community as possible.",EMERGENCY ROOMS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (89%); VACCINES (89%); VIRUSES (89%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (78%); DEATH & DYING (78%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (78%); ISOLATION & QUARANTINE (78%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (77%); POPULATION SIZE (77%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (77%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (76%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (76%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012 (71%)

Even with the most abundant supply of COVID-19 vaccines in the world, the daily infections of the novel coronavirus in the United States have stayed well above 100,000 for two consecutive weeks, pushing the country back to where it was in its fight against the virus when US President Joe Biden took office nearly seven months ago.
Regretfully, the resurgence of the pandemic has only prompted the Biden administration to intensify its efforts to scapegoat China for the global pandemic, and to press other countries and the World Health Organization to do the same, as if doubling down on its predecessor's blame-game tactics against China is all it will take to see the US through the pandemic.
That makes it no different from the previous Donald Trump administration in its readiness to shirk its responsibilities as a major country.
In the face of the global public health crisis, major players in international affairs are duty bound to promote global solidarity and to work together to ensure fair access to essential medical supplies and act concertedly to boost stability and growth. While that is what China and many other big countries have been doing, the US has not only refused to join hands with them, it has acted to sabotage their cooperation, trying to prevent the formation of any united front in the fight against humanity's common enemy.
Thanks to the US government's politicizing of the pandemic, cooperation is presented as being an either-or choice between siding with China or the US.
The Biden and Trump administrations' condescending attitude toward the WHO and their anti-science stance speak volumes about the divisive approach they have taken to the pandemic since the beginning. Those politicians hijacking the US' foreign relations with their anti-China agenda have shown they have no intention of tackling the pandemic as a public health threat, as they view it as an opportunity to serve their cause.
A report on the US' failure to respond to the pandemic jointly published by three Chinese think tanks on Monday indicates that it is not only the worst-hit country in the world due to its own government's failures and selfishness, but also constantly stooping to new lows to sabotage international solidarity in the fight against the virus.
That said, those hoping that the rising number of infections and deaths in the US will awaken the US administration to the urgency of changing its approach are indulging in wishful thinking, as those politicians in Washington only see the lives lost to COVID-19 in the US and elsewhere as being further ammunition with which to attack China.
In stark contrast to the US, China has been doing all it can to fulfill its international responsibilities in the war against the virus, save lives at home and beyond and maintain the global supply chains. Washington's scheme of using the pandemic to contain China is doomed to failure, but the world will continue to pay a heavy price until it accepts that fact.",PUBLIC HEALTH (91%); EPIDEMICS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2016 (90%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2020 (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (89%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (89%); ELECTIONS & POLITICS (89%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (89%); HIJACKING (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (77%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (77%); VIRUSES (77%); GOVERNMENT & PUBLIC ADMINISTRATION (75%); US PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES 2012 (75%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (72%); US PRESIDENTS (72%); VACCINES (72%); FOREIGN RELATIONS (71%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS (70%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (69%); UNITED NATIONS INSTITUTIONS (69%); INTERNATIONAL ASSISTANCE (66%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (60%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (54%)

Despite the drop in the number of daily new infections worldwide, there is still no sign that the COVID-19 pandemic will be brought under control globally any time soon. Although it is clear that the vaccination rate within a country makes a difference to its own situation.
The daily increase in cases in the United States has dropped below 20,000 from more than 100,000 at the highest level thanks to the fact that 63 percent of adults have been inoculated with at least one dose of a COVID-19 vaccine.
However, many developing countries, the less-developed countries in particular, still lack the vaccines they need to help them prevent the spread of the virus, which on spreading further can mutate into different variants. Some of the variants that have emerged have proved to be highly infectious.
Whether all countries are able to acquire vaccines will make a difference to how quickly the pandemic can be brought under control globally. That some developed countries such as the US have purchased and hoarded many times more doses of vaccines than they actually need is in sharp contrast to those underdeveloped countries that are in desperate need of vaccines.
The developed countries have made promises to donate vaccines, yet what they have promised remains merely lip service at present, for various reasons, although they should know that helping the less-developed countries fight against the pandemic is also helping themselves.
China has promised on different occasions that the vaccines it has developed will be a public good for the global fight against the pandemic, and it has demonstrated that it meant what it said. It has set a good example by providing other countries with as many doses of vaccines as possible within its means.
It has already donated 10 million doses of vaccines to COVAX and exported vaccines to more than 40 countries, and the Chinese government is encouraging the country's vaccine manufacturers to localize production in as many countries as possible.
Three Chinese vaccine manufacturers have already developed joint projects with eight countries to jointly manufacture vaccines in those countries, which will contribute tremendously to the provision of vaccines to local people. Talks on joint manufacturing of vaccines locally are also underway between Chinese manufacturers and their counterparts in another 10 countries. Such international cooperation on vaccines will hopefully help contribute to the global endeavor to establish a shield against the spread of the virus.
It is hoped that the developed countries will make similar efforts to do whatever they can to expand the provision of vaccines to developing and less-developed countries as soon as possible.

With the most advanced medical research and healthcare system in the world, the United States should have been the strongest link in the world's defensive line against the novel coronavirus. Nevertheless, it has proved to be the weakest.
Although it has only 4 percent of the world's population, the country accounts for 18 percent of the global COVID-19 infections. It is the US' failure to respond to the pandemic at home and its government's divisive efforts to try and politicize it that has caused more than 62,000 deaths on US soil due to the disease, hindered the progress of efforts to contain the virus and sabotaged the global solidarity required for that.
After systematically combing through the facts, a research report on the US' response to the pandemic jointly published by three Chinese think tanks last week concluded that after the US administration realized it had lost the golden opportunity of getting the virus under control at home, it gave up trying to contain it and started loosening its exit controls, which enabled the virus to spread to other countries.
The US government's selfish and brazen thinking is that if it cannot control the virus at home, just let it go where it wants.
Statistics show that from April 2020 to March this year, people from the US made 23.2 million outbound trips, and between November 2020 and January this year, when the average daily infections in the country hit about 186,000, there were 87,000 outbound trips a day on average.
Reportedly, among the variants of the virus in Israel, 70 percent are from the US. About 30 percent of imported cases in the Republic of Korea are from the US, and about 14 percent of the cases in Australia originate from the US.
What is more shocking is that Washington has repatriated large numbers of illegal immigrants to their home countries in Latin America, while the pandemic is raging in the US. Many of the returnees have been infected with the virus, spreading it to Guatemala, Jamaica, Mexico, Haiti, and elsewhere. No wonder more than 60 agencies from the US and beyond have issued a joint statement criticizing the callousness of the US government in driving away these illegal immigrants, without taking any quarantine measures to protect them.
Moreover, the US has around 200 military bases around the world, and its military personnel have spread the virus to the countries where they are stationed, thanks to the US military personnel's defiance of local pandemic prevention and control measures.
The parsimony of the US in supplying its surplus of vaccines to the world, and the indifference it displays to the fact that it is serving as a main source of imported infections in countries around the world speaks volumes about the US government's callous indifference to harm it is doing by not making greater efforts to control the virus.
The more political manipulations US politicians conduct, displaying their shameful disregard for people's lives, the more firmly they will be nailed to history's pole of shame.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); EPIDEMICS (89%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (89%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (78%); ISOLATION & QUARANTINE (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (77%); MEDICAL RESEARCH (77%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (77%); REPORTS, REVIEWS & SECTIONS (77%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (77%); VIRUSES (77%); IMPORT TRADE (76%); POPULATION SIZE (76%); VACCINES (73%); RESEARCH REPORTS (72%); STATISTICS (70%); ARMED FORCES (62%); ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS (60%); BUSINESS REPORTS & FORECASTS (52%)"

For the US administration, the heavy loss of life caused by the novel coronavirus — more than 83,000 as of Wednesday, nearly one-third of the world's total — is because the pandemic is a sneak attack on the United States.
When the US president said that it is China that should be asked why the US is still seeing so many deaths and new cases when, as his administration claims, the US has done a much better job than other countries in testing, while taking the question at a news conference on Monday, it is clear that the US leader remains steadfast in portraying China as the enemy, not the virus.
Which is in line with his rhetoric last week when he called the COVID-19 pandemic the ""worst attack"" on the US — worse than the Pearl Harbor and the World Trade Center — and one that should have been stopped by China at the source. In doing so he is trying to establish a correlation between the two plotted surprise attacks and the novel coronavirus outbreak.
The reasoning seemingly being that since it was a sneak attack, his administration's belated response to the pandemic is pardonable.
Although he skips over it, there is plenty of proof that the virus is natural, not man-made; that there were COVID-19 cases in the US before any appeared in China; and most imported cases in the US are not from China but from elsewhere in the world.
The virus is a common enemy, and the US is in the same trench as China. Indeed, this is a foe of all people, which is being fought on many fronts. Although the first big battle was fought in Wuhan, Central China's Hubei province, where 83 percent of the deaths caused by the virus in China occurred, that does not necessarily mean that is where the virus first attacked.
And were it not for the huge sacrifice made by the residents in Wuhan who endured a lockdown for 76 days, the situation in China and the world would undoubtedly have been more daunting.
After losing the golden opportunity to contain the virus in a concentrated area in the same way, the US has to deal with cross-transmission at the community level nationwide, which means it is jumping the gun in encouraging people to return to work.
To weather the perfect storm that is battering the country calls for decision-makers in the US to give due respect to science and the facts. Something the current administration is loathe to do as it would settle once and for all that the virus is not a Chinese weapon, real or imagined, and make it obvious to all that the US is the one weaponizing the pandemic as a means to attack China.

The 2020 China Internet Media Forum opens in Shanghai on Sept 27, 2020. [Photo/CCTV]
The 2020 China Internet Media Forum opened in Shanghai on Sunday, with its theme focused on the mission and responsibilities for Chinese internet media in an era of changes.
The two-day event included a main forum and four sub-forums on content, technology, industry and responsibility, gathering experts from news outlets and internet companies to offer their insights.
The prevalence of smart phones in recent years has not only brought ubiquitous internet access to the public but also made it possible for the large-scale spread of rumors and misinformation.
Li Yanhong, chairman and CEO of Baidu Inc, said internet media in China has undergone a main change in its more than 20-year development — from displaying the same web pages for all online visitors to feeding different users with a tailored information flow.
""With the algorithm becoming a key for internet media, are users seeing a bigger world or smaller world?"" Li asked in a rhetorical question.
""An algorithm should not simply feed users with the kind of news they're obsessed with, but understand users' higher purpose,"" he said. ""The direction of development for internet media should be squared with users' fundamental interest.""
Li said during the battle against COVID-19 the company launched a new channel to provide authoritative news updates to the public, and collaborated with public health institutes and media outlets to improve public awareness of related health knowledge.
Ren Yuxin, chief operating officer of Tencent Holdings Ltd, said the company is dedicated to building a clean and clear internet environment.
According to Ren, the company provided fact check services 700 million times and handled 40,000 rumors on its open platforms from the early days of the novel coronavirus outbreak to mid-April.
""As a platform company, we will play our role in directing web traffic to good deeds with help from related parties,"" Ren said, citing examples of the company's annual charity campaign helping non-profit organizations to fundraise, and its collaboration with cultural institutions to promote traditional Chinese culture.
Despite the internet changing the way people get information, the mission for news outlets remains the same — producing accurate, serious and timely content for their audience, experts from traditional media said.
""Content is still the king,"" said Wang Huimin, a member of the editorial board of People's Daily. ""Long-time practice has shown that the credibility of a news outlet relies on its constant production of in-depth and accurate news.""
Wang said a news outlet should not overlook its role in providing orientation for society.
""The form of media technology will change, but media's responsibility of educating the public will not change,"" Wang said.
Sun Yusheng, senior producer of China Media Group, which was founded with China Central Television, China National Radio and China Radio International in 2018, said being on the spot is the golden rule for news media.
""One of our key responsibilities is to provide accurate information when a major event breaks, and satisfy the audience's concern about hot topics,"" Sun said. ""Since the outbreak of COVID-19 happened in Wuhan, we have sent 216 reporters since Chinese New Year's Day, and broadcast a 24-hour news program, Fighting COVID-19, for 73 days.""
Sun said its mobile video app Yangshipin gained more than 8 million active users by non-stop livestreaming of the 10-day construction of Huoshenshan and Leishenshan hospitals in Wuhan.
The forum was held by the Office of the Central Cyberspace Affairs Commission, Shanghai Municipal Cyberspace Affairs Commission and Xinhua News Agency.

News that Airbus will sell 292 planes to Chinese airlines in a blockbuster deal worth $37 billion proves that the efforts by the Netherlands-headquartered plane manufacturer to tap into the vast Chinese market - including building a local final assembly line in Tianjin - have paid off. It is a win-win for both China and Europe.
Given its decades-long competition with Airbus for dominance in the world's second-largest aviation market, this has been interpreted as a heavy blow to its US archrival Boeing. And by some as a message to the United States. ""This is China sending a sign, and it hurts Boeing terribly,"" a Bloomberg report said.
The US-based airplane manufacturer was more straightforward in response to the biggest purchase order made by Chinese carriers since the start of the COVID-19 pandemic. ""As a top US exporter with a 50-year relationship with China's aviation industry, it is disappointing that geopolitical differences continue to constrain US aircraft exports.""
The statement points to one aspect behind the deal, but it is an oversimplification of the causes for the sharp decline in orders from the Chinese market. So far this year, Boeing has delivered just one commercial jet to China as compared to 47 by Airbus. The US company's poor sales performance can also be attributed to uncertainty over Boeing's 737 MAX planes - which were suspended from use in the country after deadly crashes in 2019 - as well as a series of production issues.
The US' decoupling policy also deters China from buying Boeing planes as the after-sales services and maintenance will be subject to the whim of some US politicians' will.
Many Chinese companies have already fallen victims to the US-initiated confrontation against China on the trade and technology fronts, with many having suffered from export controls, divestment orders, sanctions and tariffs imposed on them by the US government, in the name of safeguarding the US' national security and economic interests. Telecommunications giant Huawei, for example, suffered its biggest-ever decline in revenue in the first half of 2021 after the US imposed sanctions.
Under such circumstances, it is naive to believe that US companies including Boeing would be able to remain unaffected by the worsening Sino-US trade and economic relations and continue to tap into and benefit from China's vast market.
Boeing's setback in the Chinese market reflects the extent to which the trade war launched by Washington has damaged the once booming, and mutually beneficial economic and trade relations between the two economies.
Hopefully, those in Washington responsible for the dire situation will wake up to the folly of their way of doing business.","AEROSPACE SECTOR PERFORMANCE (90%); AVIATION SECTOR PERFORMANCE (89%); EMBARGOES & SANCTIONS (89%); EXPORT TRADE (89%); TRADE DISPUTES (89%); DIVESTITURES (78%); NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS (78%); SALES & SELLING (78%); SALES FIGURES (77%); US FEDERAL GOVERNMENT (74%); EXPORT CONTROLS (72%); INTERNATIONAL RELATIONS & NATIONAL SECURITY (72%); TARIFFS & DUTIES (72%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (67%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (67%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (67%); ECONOMY & ECONOMIC INDICATORS (65%); ELECTIONS & POLITICS (62%)

In more than four weeks of field research in China earlier this year, a team of World Health Organization experts visited nine key sites and spoke with numerous Chinese experts, as well as medical professionals and people in communities in Wuhan, the city where novel coronavirus infections were first identified. Having obtained large amounts of data and information, the team was fulsome in its praise for the support that China had given them and their research.
The report the WHO released on the research results in March concluded that it was extremely unlikely the virus had leaked from a lab, which should have put an end to Washington's insistence that the Wuhan Institute of Virology is the origin of the outbreak.
Unfortunately, that has proved not to be the case. Instead, the US administration has been even more vociferous in apportioning blame to China and the lab. And having reversed the decision of his predecessor to withdraw the US from the world health body and stop paying its dues, US President Joe Biden's campaign appears to have press-ganged a new recruit in the form of the WHO.
Speaking on Friday, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said that getting access to raw data had been a challenge for the international team that visited China, and there had been a ""premature push"" to rule out the theory that the virus might have escaped from a lab.
Perhaps the thinking within the WHO — like that of many — is the virus came from the US' known-to-be-leaky Fort Detrick biological weapons research lab. However, the WHO chief's drastically different stance on the field study and the WHO's proposal that a second-stage investigation into the origin of the virus should include further studies in China and an ""audit"" of the Wuhan lab — even before any field studies have been conducted in the US and elsewhere — suggests the world health body has succumbed to political pressure from the United States and its allies.
In a news conference in Beijing on Thursday, Zeng Yixin, vice minister of the National Health Commission, rejected the WHO's plan to conduct another COVID-19 origin tracing study in China.
That should be taken as China's official reply to the proposal, which is fully justified given the plan contains language that doesn't respect science, and there are sufficient clues and evidence that the virus was circulating in various countries before it was identified in Wuhan, which need to be investigated first.
As the WHO field team acknowledged, China has set a good example with the support it gave the origin-tracing efforts. If all countries, particularly those hard-hit countries, were to share their data and cooperate with the WHO as earnestly as China has, and were as transparent in their handling of the virus, it might be possible to determine where and how the virus made the jump to humans.

The 13th Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference National Committee, the country's top political advisory body, concluded its postponed and greatly shortened annual session on Wednesday.
Usually, the CPPCC National Committee's annual session lasts around 10 days, but this year, with impressive efficiency, the national political advisory body drastically condensed its agenda and completed its work in seven days.
Despite the disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, and rigid social-distancing rules, the vigorous CPPCC discourse has maintained its focus on vital issues of most concerns to the people. But judging from what has been heard from their meetings, the representatives have been as dedicated as usual in fulfilling their advisory roles.
They have called for reinforcing the country's epidemic early warning and response mechanisms; reiterated the pressing need to cope with the potential negative impacts of the disrupted global industrial supply chains; and stressed the importance of the decision not to extend poverty-elimination deadline. They offered straightforward assessments of the country's outstanding weaknesses as well as urging technological self-reliance.
The greatly shortened schedule and reduced media coverage have kept some of their concerns and opinions worth broader audiences from the limelight they deserve. But what is clear is that their discussions focused on addressing people's concerns, and their proposals and suggestions are aimed at enhancing the people's sense of gain, well-being and happiness.
This meeting was held at a critical moment for the overall promotion of epidemic prevention and control, and economic and social development. While some annual routines can wait until the political advisers meet next year, matters like these can't.
As the COVID-19 pandemic appears to have peaked in most major countries, and many countries are itching to open a post-pandemic chapter, the country can't afford entering that brand new stage unprepared. Especially since many of the changes in a post-COVID-19 world may have to do with this country.
During the session, President Xi Jinping visited the members of the 13th National Committee of the CPPCC and participated in a joint group meeting, focusing on major issues and pointing out the direction for the CPPCC members to perform their duties and responsibilities.
It was important that the CPPCC members grasped the general trend and pooled their wisdom so that what has been a crisis can be turned into an opportunity. At present, the situation at home and abroad is complicated, and the challenges facing China's economic and social development are unprecedented. As the country wades deeper into uncharted waters of a rapidly changing world and increasingly hostile political climate, the political advisers must never hesitate to share their wisdom about what is and what is not the right thing to do, to help the country stay on course to realize a moderately prosperous society in all aspects and fulfill the tasks of the 13th Five-Year Plan (2016-20).
While political resolve may prove essential in a new world full of ""changes unseen in a century"", the political advisory body, as the session has shown, has unmatched importance for people-oriented decision-making.
