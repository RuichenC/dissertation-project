2020/9/25,Tell Us: How Is the Pandemic Affecting Youth Employment in Europe?,BUSINESS,"In this lesson, students will learn about families navigating life after losing a loved one to Covid-19. Then, they will learn more about young people and grief or share a story about their grandparents or elders.
Lesson Overview
Featured Article: âAs Families Grieve, Grandparents Step Up,â?by Paula Span with photographs by Todd Heisler
In the United States, as many as 200,000 children have had a parent die from Covid-19. In the wake of those losses, other family members â?often grandparents â?frequently step up to support the grieving children.
In this lesson, you will learn about how grandparents and grandchildren are navigating new relationships after the death of a family member. Then, you will watch a film about a grief camp for young people or write a brief story about your relationship with your grandparent or another elder in your life.
Warm-Up
Analyze statistics about Covid-19 deaths.
Explore The New York Times's tracker of Covid-19 cases and deaths. What do you notice about cases nationally and internationally? What about death rates?
Then, look at rates specifically in your state or region. How do deaths from Covid-19 in your area compare to the rest of country or world? Are you surprised by these statistics? Why or why not?
Questions for Writing and Discussion
Read the article or listen to the 15-minute embedded audio. Then, answer the following questions:
1. How have Covid-19 deaths affected the relationships between some grandparents and their grandchildren?
2. Choose one quote from the article that illustrates a positive aspect of this change.
3. Choose one quote that demonstrates the challenges and stresses that can arise from the new relationships.
4. What story do the photographs in this article tell? If you were to explain the main idea, or a primary theme, of the article using only three photographs, which three photographs would you choose? Why?
5. What forms of support do the young people in the article, and their grandparents, have as they cope with grief and navigate their changing relationships?
6. What is your reaction to the article? What did you learn? Were you able to relate to any of the stories or experiences documented in the article?
Going Further
Option 1: Reflect on your relationship with a grandparent or elder.
Do any of the relationships between grandparents and grandchildren remind you of your relationship with your grandparents or another elder in your community?
We recently asked students to respond to âConstancy in Candy,â?which a reader submitted to the Tiny Love Stories column. In this brief story, Samantha Facciolo writes about her grandmother:
My grandmother kept a candy bowl on a table by her front door. Growing up, I would sneak butterscotches and strawberry sweets. During the pandemic, my grandmother moved into assisted living. On my first visit after lockdown, I saw how much of her 90-year life she had discarded to fit into her new residence. Yet, she'd saved the familiar bowl. Driving home, I discovered that she'd slipped its candy into my purse. Years before, when I had confessed my childhood thievery, she laughed. âWhy do you think I kept it on that low table? It's always been for you.â?    â?Do you have, or have you had, a close connection with a grandparent or an elder? What is, or was, your relationship like?
    â?What is one item, like the candy bowl belonging to Ms. Facciolo's grandmother, that reminds you of this person?
Now, write a story of no more than 100 words about a grandparent or an elder who has been a part of your life. Post it in the comments or submit it to Tiny Love Stories.
Option 2: Learn about grief and young people.
Watch this Film Club about a camp for children and teens who have lost someone important. As you watch, think about how this film might connect with the stories of the young people that you read about in the featured article. You can also use our Film Club Double-Entry Journal (PDF) to help you remember specific moments from the film.
After watching the film, respond to the following questions in your journal or through a class discussion. Or share your answers in the comments section of the Film Club.
    â?What moments in this film stood out for you? Why?
    â?What messages, emotions or ideas will you take away from this film? Why?
    â?How did the film relate to the article you read above? What was similar? What was different?

2022/4/26,"Lesson of the Day: 'As Families Grieve, Grandparents Step Up' Current Events",LEARNING; lesson-plans,"This article is part of Times Opinion's reflection on the two year mark of the coronavirus pandemic. Read more in a note from Alexandra Sifferlin, Opinion's health and science editor, in our Opinion Today newsletter. 
We're headed into the third year of pandemic life, and one thing is clear: We're all exhausted from Covid. Virus caseloads are waning across the country, masks are coming off, people are traveling more, and office workers have new return dates. Does that mean the pandemic is over? Maybe. And maybe not.
On Feb. 25, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention relaxed its guidelines on mask wearing and social distancing, saying that 70 percent of Americans no longer need to heed those recommendations. But for a lot of people, like parents of kids under 5 and those who are immunocompromised, this presents more challenges. It's clear the burden of managing Covid risk increasingly rests on the individual, so what are we supposed to do now?

It's a lot to contemplate. So on today's show, Jane puts that question to two experts to help the rest of us.
Dr. Monica Gandhi is an infectious-disease physician whose previous work on H.I.V. informs her assessment of public health messaging during this pandemic. Dr. Aaron E. Carroll is the chief health officer at Indiana University and has spent the pandemic thinking about how to keep his community safe. The good news? Both of them think we've got the tools to move forward safely.

2022/3/9,The New Phase of the Pandemic Is Covid Exhaustion,OPINION,"The development comes as the United States recently began averaging more than 100,000 new confirmed cases per day again, according to a New York Times database, for the first time since February.
Another form of the Omicron subvariant BA.2 has become the dominant version among new U.S. coronavirus cases, according to federal estimates on Tuesday, a development that experts had forecast over the last few weeks.
There was no indication yet that the new subvariant, known as BA.2.12.1, causes more severe disease than earlier forms did. BA.2.12.1 made up about 58 percent of all new U.S. cases, according to estimates by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for the week ending May 21.
As Americans approach their third Memorial Day weekend of the pandemic, the country is averaging more than 100,000 new confirmed cases per day for the first time since February, according to a New York Times database. Newly reported cases have been rising in nearly every state, many infections go uncounted in official statistics, so the true number of infections may be higher. As of Monday, there were an average of more than 24,700 people with the virus hospitalized nationally, an increase of 28 percent over the last two weeks.
BA.2.12.1 spreads more rapidly than previous versions of Omicron including the form which sent U.S. cases soaring over the winter. The new version evolved from BA.2, which itself was more contagious than any variant that came before it. New York State health officials said mid-April that the Omicron subvariants known as BA.2.12 and BA.2.12.1 accounted for more than 90 percent of new cases in central New York State.
In New York City, Omicron subvariants are powering the fifth wave of virus cases and officials put the city on âhigh Covid alertâ?last week, after rising case counts and hospitalizations reached a level that could put substantial pressure on the health care system. There was no sign that mask mandates were coming back in New York City, even asfederal health officials warned that a large share of Americans were living in areas with âmedium to highâ?levels of virus transmission.
And many Americans should consider wearing masks, Dr. Ashish K. Jha, the White House's new Covid-19 coordinator, said. âI feel that very strongly, that in crowded indoor spaces, in places with high transmission, people should be doing that,â?he said on ABC's âThis Weekâ?on Sunday. Last month, a federal judge in Florida struck down a mask mandate on public transport and the country's largest airlines stopped requiring masks on flights, ending a practice that most carriers followed for nearly two years.
Dr. Jha also emphasized the importance of people getting vaccinated and boosted. âWhat we know is vaccines continue to provide a high level of protection against people getting seriously ill,â?he said. In a sign of growing concern, the C.D.C. said late last week that all people 50 or older should get a second booster shot if at least four months have passed since their first booster, strengthening its recommendation.
Still, conditions appear to be stabilizing in some Northeastern states that were among the first to see a spring surge in cases. Though still high, case rates have started to level off or decline in New Jersey, New York and Rhode Island.
BA.2, which still makes up about 39 percent of new U.S. cases, according to the latest federal estimates, was first identified in the United States in December, and it grew to accountfor about 55 percent of new U.S. cases near the end of March.
Since genetic sequencing of the virus is performed on just a portion of test samples across the country, the latest C.D.C. estimates are subject to revision as more data come in. That is what happened in late December, when the agency had to significantly decrease its estimate for the nationwide prevalence of the Omicron variant known as BA.1. Before that, the Delta variant had been dominant in the United States since early summer.
Last week, the United States officiallysurpassed a total of one million known deaths from Covid-19, according to a New York Times database. That is the world's highest confirmed death total, and comes as the White House continues to call for Congress to pass stalled Covid aid for more treatments and vaccines.

2022/5/24,"Another Omicron subvariant, known as BA.2.12.1, has become the dominant form among new U.S. virus cases.",US,"The city of Mumbai will conduct random tests in crowded places as India confronts a growing number of coronavirus cases.
Mumbai, India's financial hub, has begun random testing for the coronavirus in malls, railway stations and other crowded places as officials attempt to tamp down on a worrying surge in cases.
Rapid antigen tests will be taken without individuals' consent, the Municipal Corporation of Greater Mumbai said in a statement on Monday. Anyone who resists will be in violation of India's colonial-era epidemic act, which gives the government the power to fine or imprison people who violate rules to contain an outbreak.
âWe are trying to implement the existing protocol to the strictest possible level: use of face mask, regulating the number of people in one event, use of hand sanitizer, and now tests,â?Suresh Kakani, a senior municipal official in Mumbai, told The New York Times.
Active Covid-19 cases in Mumbai have risen by more than 140 percent since March 1. With variants circulating and commercial activity almost back to prepandemic levels, the number of infections has also shot up in the surrounding state of Maharashtra. An entire district was forced back into lockdown last week.
Mr. Kakani said officials are determined to avert another lockdown in Mumbai, the city of 20 million that is home to Bollywood, India's film industry, as well as the country's largest stock exchange.
Another lockdown would be economically disastrous for India, which is just starting to recover from a lockdown last year that triggered a humanitarian crisis, as millions of migrant workers fled cities for their home villages, and a recession.

2021/3/23,India 's commercial hub plans a testing blitz after cases spike.,WORLD,"The country has struggled to contain the coronavirus since the pandemic began, and its official rate before the revised estimate was already the ninth highest in the world.
Peru says that its Covid-19 death toll is almost three times as high as it had officially counted until now, making it one of the hardest-hit nations relative to its population.
In a report released on Monday that combined deaths from multiple databases and reclassified fatalities, the government said that 180,764 people had died from Covid-19 through May 22, almost triple the official death tollof about 68,000. The new figure would mean that more people have died in Peru relative to its population than in Hungary and the Czech Republic, the countries with the highest official death tolls per person, according to a New York Times database.
The report landed at a precarious moment for Peru's government, just days before the second round of a closely watched presidential election.
Peru has struggled to contain the coronavirus since the pandemic began, and its official death toll before the revised estimate was already the ninth highest per capita in the world. As early as last June, far more deaths were occurring there than would be expected in a normal year, and the gap â?a figure known as excess deaths â?was much larger than the number of deaths officially attributed to Covid-19, according to New York Times data. That was a warning sign to experts that Covid deaths were being undercounted.
William Pan, who teaches global environmental health at Duke University, said the pandemic had underscored the deep inequality and corruption in Peru.
âLong before the stories of oxygen shortages in India and Manaus, Iquitos experienced this sad reality of Covid,â?said Dr. Pan, referring to the largest Peruvian city in the Amazon. âThousands of people were being turned away last April and May due to lack of oxygen, lack of space, medical staff being totally overwhelmed and more.â?Peru could be the first of several nations forced to reckon with a re-evaluation of the pandemic's true impact. The World Health Organization said in May that deaths from Covid-19 globally were probably much higher than had been recorded.
Peru's government will start publishing more accurate daily tallies of cases and deaths based on new guidelines laid out in the report, said Oscar Ugarte, the health minister.
The pandemic has intensified the political turmoil in Peru, which was rocked by the impeachment of President MartÃ­n Vizcarra in November. He was one of four presidents to serve in five years, three of whom spent time in jail during bribery investigations.
The virus is spreading faster in South America than on any other continent, according to official data, with five nations among the top 10 globally for new cases reported per person. Its worst outbreak is in Argentina, which was supposed to host the Copa AmÃ©rica soccer tournament, before organizers announced that they were moving it to Brazil.

2021/5/31,Peru says its true Covid death toll is almost triple its official count.,WORLD,"Olivia Mitra Framke and Andrea Carla Michaels weave a fascinating theme.
THURSDAY PUZZLE â?I knew that I was going to be a fan of Olivia Mitra Framke's puzzles the moment I finished solving her New York Times debut in 2017. If you haven't solved that one, I highly recommend it. After you finish reading this column, of course.
Ms. Framke has had 10 more puzzles published in The Times since her debut â?all of them solo constructions â?but today's puzzle is her first collaboration. Andrea Carla Michaels, on the other hand, is an enthusiastic collaborator: she has shared the byline on 47 of her 78 Times crosswords. Now the soloist and the collaborator have come together to work on a puzzle and, I don't know, is that considered crossing the streams, like in âGhostbusters?â?Whatever it is, it's fun. Their puzzle was a pleasure to solve and, even if it's not the toughest Thursday, it's a nice transition to the themeless, late week puzzles.
Tricky Clues
1A. It's never encouraging to get the answer wrong in the first clue you solve, but I wrote in NANO as the entry for âPrefix with particle.â?The answer is ANTI.
24A. The clue âPart of some Arabic namesâ?is vague enough that the answer could Abu (which means âfather ofâ?, bin or ibn (both of which mean âson ofâ?. In this puzzle, the answer is ABU, which is gettable from the crossings.
34A. This one made me smile, because it reminded me of days at the beach making sand castles with my kids. A âMold for a castle, maybeâ?is PAIL.
46A. I felt a bit 'mehâ?about this clue and entry (it looks like an odd initialism but it's not, and the clue is vague), but, like ABU at 24A, it's solvable through the crossings.
64A. Covid-19 enters the New York Times Crossword chat! The SWABS in this entry are components in a Covid test. The entry Covid has not yet appeared, and the entry VIRUS has never been clued to the pandemic.
2D. This âRider of the lost ark?â?is not Indiana Jones, it's NOAH. Nice misdirection.
7D./31D. Were you confused by 7D's âGreek letter (but not the last one)â? It was tricky because English speakers associate Z with the last letter of the alphabet; in the Greek alphabet, however, ZETA is the sixth letter. ALPHA is the first letter, and the answer to 31D's âGreek letter (definitely not the last one).â?43D. I had to really think about this one. The clue âFlower with a canine-sounding nameâ?made me think of âdogwood,â?even though that's a tree (it does have gorgeous flowers). The answer is DOG ROSE, which has only appeared in the New York Times Crossword once, and that was in 1962.
Today's Theme
How well do you know your state nicknames? That's one of the questions asked in Ms. Framke and Ms. Michaels's puzzle. The other one is, how good are you at blending the state names together to make a larger one? You will need that skill in particular to figure out what's going on in the theme entries.
Ms. Framke and Ms. Michaels offer us three theme clues that are state nicknames, separated by hyphens. The answers are the real names of those states, and they overlap, which is a great find on the constructors's parts.
For example, at 20A, the answer to the clue âBuckeye-Hawkeye-Yellowhammerâ?is OHIOWALABAMA, because the clue consists of the nicknames for OHIO, IOWA and ALABAMA.
If you would like to see the answers to the other two theme answers, click on their clues below.
And how do we know all of this? There's a revealer at 54A. The answer to the clue âU.S. geographical grouping â?or a hint to 20-, 27- and 47-Acrossâ?is TRISTATE AREA.
Constructor Notes
Olivia Mitra Framke: It has been such a pleasure to work with Andrea on my first New York Times collaboration! When I was first starting out in the biz, Andrea provided me with invaluable guidance and I'm thrilled to share a byline with her today.
This is also my first Thursday puzzle! I was definitely out of my comfort zone â?I'm more of a Sunday, Monday, Tuesday constructor â?but I'm really happy with how it came out.
I love the playfulness of the theme entries; they're just so fun to say. I remember we struggled with the best way to clue them. Originally, we thought of describing a road trip route via cities and using something like INTERSTATE (âType of travel used in this puzzleâ? as the revealer. But I think the revealer we landed on makes for a tighter theme, since it specifically calls out how we got three states in each entry. And as someone who has lived almost her whole life in the N.Y.C. TRISTATE AREA, this revealer feels cozy to me, like coming home.
Hope you enjoyed!
Andrea Carla Michaels: I met the crazily brilliant Olivia Framke when she reached out on the Facebook Crossword Puzzle Collaboration Directory, which matches mentors with new constructors.
Olivia was inspired to create a long list of overlapping states based on my offhand remark about being intrigued with discovering four shared letters between MiNNESota and TeNNESsee! (My fave is the fact that the two shortest named states, OHIO and IOWA, overlap into OHIOWA.)
From there, we wrestled with the best way to clue the theme and to come up with a dead-on reveal.
I look forward to more collaborations. We've bonded (Oliviandrea?) but have yet to meet IRL, as the kids say!

2020/4/26,Gear to Bring the Outdoors Inside Wirecutter,TRAVEL,"Gov. Greg Abbott, a Republican, issued an executive order on Tuesday that will prohibit cities and counties from enforcing mask mandates.
Most government authorities in Texas will soon be prohibited from requiring people to wear masks, Gov. Greg Abbott announced on Tuesday, days after federal health officialsannounced new guidance that encourages people who have been completely vaccinated to forego masks in most situations.
The executive order Mr. Abbott announced on Tuesday would prevent counties, cities, public health authorities and local government officials from requiring people to wear masks beginning on Friday. Violators could be fined $1,000.
Hospitals owned or operated by the government, state-supported living centers and jails and other criminal justice facilities are exempt from the order. Schools can continue their current mask policies until June 4, the end of the school year in some Texas districts, after which they will not be allowed to compel anyone to wear a mask. The C.D.C. also recommended that masks remain universally in use in K-12 schools until the end of the current school year.
Only a third of Texans are fully vaccinated, below the U.S. average of 37 percent, according to a New York Times database. No Covid-19 vaccines have been authorized yet for children under 12.
In Texas, where Mr. Abbott, a Republican, rescinded a statewide mask mandate and capacity restrictions on March 10, the new recommendations from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were less of a shock than they were in other states, where officials and business leaders scrambled to figure out how to safely accommodate residents and customers. Many states, and chains like Target, CVS and Best Buy, have since relaxed their mask mandates for vaccinated people.
Mr. Abbott's mask rollback in March invigorated some individuals and business owners and alarmed others. But some local leaders chose to initially keep mask requirements in place, including the mayors of Texas' biggest cities â?Houston, Austin, San Antonio and Dallas â?all of which are in counties won by President Biden.
Mayor Sylvester Turner of Houston, a Democrat, called the governor's new order âa clear overreach,â?and added, âHis power is not absolute.â?Going forward, Mr. Turner said in a statement, âIf you are a city employee or entering a city facility and you have not been fully vaccinated, you should wear your mask. We are not mandating it, but I strongly encourage everyone to get vaccinated to protect yourself, your family and your co-workers.â?Mayor Steve Adler of Austin and Travis County Judge Andy Brown, both Democrats, said in a statement that in the coming days, âwe will be speaking with parts of our community most impacted by the governor's order, including schools and nursing homes. Our community's safety will continue to be our highest priority.â?The average number of cases and deaths in Texas has been trending downward, but those numbers are still relatively high, according to a New York Times database. 
âTexans, not government, should decide their best health practices, which is why masks will not be mandated by public school districts or government entities,â?Mr. Abbott said in a statement announcing the order. âWe can continue to mitigate Covid-19 while defending Texans' liberty to choose whether or not they mask up.â?PHOTO: Visitors at the Alamo in San Antonio last week.

2021/5/18,Texas governor will bar local governments from requiring masks.,WORLD,"New York City is often a bellwether for the nation when it comes to the coronavirus, and the warning lights are flashing: Last week, rising case counts and hospitalizations triggered a ''high Covid alert,'' indicating ''high community spread'' and ''substantial pressure'' on health care services. This latest wave, which is New York City's fifth, started in mid-March. At first it was driven by the BA.2 subvariant of Omicron, but now most cases are caused by newer versions -- primarily BA.2.12.1, which is more transmissible than its predecessor and made up roughly 73 percent of new cases across New York, New Jersey and Puerto Rico as of midMay, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. For a recent edition of the Coronavirus Briefing newsletter, Jonathan Wolfe spoke with Joseph Goldstein, who covers health care in New York for The Times, for the latest news on Covid-19 in the city. 
Read their edited exchange below. What's the current situation? The rise this time has been building much more gradually compared with the first Omicron wave a few months back. But there's a lot of virus circulating right now, and the numbers keep climbing. We're seeing more than 4,000 confirmed cases a day, but those official numbers undercount how many people are sick because they don't incorporate at-home tests. Here's another metric: A company called Kinsa, which distributes internetconnected thermometers, said that just over 4 percent of its users in New York City reported fevers in recent days. That's a very high number. In non-Covid years it might be below 1.5 percent. You have to go back to the days of Omicron in December and January to see numbers that high. What about hospitalizations? While we're seeing an increase in hospitalizations, we aren't seeing a dizzying rise as in January, when some emergency rooms were so packed you had to pick your path through gurneys. Why is that? C.D.C. research suggests that nearly a third of the city was probably infected during the Omicron wave in January and December. So presumably a lot of New Yorkers have more protection now against severe forms of the disease. Also, more people have received their booster shots. And the antiviral pill Paxlovid is making a difference, too. How is the city approaching this wave? Mayor Eric Adams has been very clear that he's not interested in introducing new restrictions unless the hospital system is in danger of being overwhelmed, and experts say that's not happening. Epidemiologists are not predicting a precipitous rise in hospitalizations as we saw during the first Omicron wave back in December and January. Most Covid restrictions have been dropped in New York City. But there is also still a substantial health apparatus built up around Covid here. Testing is widely available. There's an organized system for distributing antivirals. In New York, there are also still a lot more people wearing masks than in other parts of the country, but it's largely not a place where the government is requiring you to do it anymore. What's the atmosphere like? You walk around New York City these days, and it's extraordinary how many people are coughing. But this is also around the time when tree pollen tends to peak here. It seems as if everybody has either been sick with Covid recently or knows a bunch of people -- colleagues and friends -- who just had it. That said, I think a lot of people are going about their lives, though others are still avoiding unmasked, public indoor settings, like crowded bars and restaurants. Everyone makes their own risk assessment. Inside The Times THE STORY BEHIND THE STORY Despite an increase in cases of Covid-19, Times Square was bustling on Wednesday.

2022/5/24,New York City 's Fifth Covid Wave,Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 2,"While Covid stole lives from all strata of society, it magnified disparities based on factors like sex, age, health care access, income and housing.
The United States has officially surpassed one million known deaths from Covid-19, according to a New York Times database, a cataclysmic outcome that only hints at the suffering of millions more Americans who are mourning their spouses, parents, children, siblings, friends and colleagues.
The milestone has been anticipated and talked about for weeks, and athe Times database of Covid deaths surpassed one million deaths late Thursday, marking the somber moment.
âHopefully, the enormity of that number would spur us on to do whatever we can to make sure that we don't have as bad a time in the coming months and years that we've had over the past two years,â?Dr. Anthony Fauci, the chief medical adviser to the president, told a Boston public radio station, WGBH, earlier this month.
Some initial forecasts put the number of Americans likely to die from the virus between 100,000 and 240,000, although officials warned that the death toll could climb if protective measures weren't taken. The United States reached 100,000 in May 2020, and 200,000 a few months later, in September.
The United States has a higher rate of infection than many other wealthy countries do, and the pathogen has continued to spread in a population afflicted by inequity, political divisions, a sometimes overwhelmed public health system, and an inconsistent array of policies and responses.
While Covid stole lives from all strata of society, it magnified disparities, and some groups have been more vulnerable than others to infection, based on factors like sex, age, health care access, income and housing.
The virus arrived in the United States by early 2020, setting off five distinct waves of new cases over the 26 months that followed. An unexpected early wave in the spring of 2020 was followed by another wave in the winter, when access to vaccines was still very limited; more Americans died in that wave than in any other period.
In January 2021, the country's daily death toll peaked, with more than 3,300 deaths recorded each day in the United States. And then came new waves: Delta in the summer of 2021 and Omicron in the late fall and winter. Omicron caused illness that was milder for some, though not for all; even so, it spread so swiftly and so widely that U.S. deaths surged again, and peaked in the first week of February, when more than 2,500 Americans a day were dying.
Now, Americans are still dying â?more than 300 a day on average, as of Thursday. Vaccines are readily available to nearly everyone other than young children, but even so, about a third of people across the country have not been fully inoculated against the virus, and about 70 percent have received no booster, despite the vaccines' effectiveness at preventing severe disease and death.
âIt's reaching a point now with Covid, where some very obvious scientific truths based on clear-cut, very visible data are rejected by people,â?Dr. Fauci said on WGBH. âWhen it gets in the way of the proper and appropriate response to a deadly outbreak, it becomes even more tragic.â?As of Tuesday, the average of new confirmed coronavirus cases surpassed 100,000 a day again, as Omicron subvariants have spread across the country. And those figures are thought to be undercounts, especially given that at-home test results often go unreported. Hospitalizations are on the rise, mostly on the East Coast; on average as of Thursday, more than 23,800 Americans were in hospitals with the coronavirus on a given day, 31 percent more than two weeks ago.
While each of the one million victims has a unique story, they leave behind a shared feeling among their loved ones, who say the lives of the dead have been pushed to the side in a country eager to get on with post-pandemic life. As it is, there is no national memorial to the people who have died, no shared remembrance, no communal place to gather, or to receive a nation's sympathy. There is only a number.

The rise of the Delta variant has prompted a thorny question: Do we need a booster dose of the vaccine for Covid-19?
Vaccine makers think so.
Pfizer said this month that it wanted to seek authorization to give third doses of its shots. But in the United States, the F.D.A. and the C.D.C. said in a joint statement that they did not yet have enough data on the state of immunity among the vaccinated to make a decision.
Principles are also at stake: Should richer countries be talking about administering extra doses when so many people around the world are yet to receive even a single shot?
On today's episode
    â?Rebecca Robbins, a business reporter covering Covid-19 vaccines for The New York Times.
Background reading
    â?Although studies of a third dose are underway, experts agree that the vaccines are still working well. Here's what to know about the potential booster dose.
    â?U.S. officials said that the decision to go ahead with a booster shot would depend partly on how many infections cause serious disease or hospitalization in vaccinated people.

2021/7/19,Do We Need a Third Covid Shot?,PODCASTS; the-daily,"With the coronavirus confining people to their homes, coloring books for both children and adults have experienced a renewed popularity. Here are some pages inspired by a few of our favorite travel photos.
Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. For the latest updates, read The New York Times's Covid-19 coverage here. 
  The Times's Travel section is tasked with bringing you the world. But with the world on pause, we're inviting you to explore far-flung destinations through another, more interactive medium: coloring pages, inspired by some of our favorite travel photos.
  Coloring books -- for children and adults alike -- have emerged with a new zeitgeist as an unbreakable, noiseless and screen-free indoor activity; AdAge named them one of the key creative trends to emerge from the pandemic.
  They are also a potentially helpful antidote to the blahs.
  ''Coloring books have been shown to reduce stress and anxiety while promoting relaxation as they help users remain present and focused, said Martha Dorn, the executive director of The Art Therapy Project, a nonprofit based in New York City. ''Repetitive strokes provide temporary relief from life stressors, and the focus required to color can keep negative emotions away.''
  Many hotels and other travel companies have jumped into the coloring-book game through downloadable, print-at-home pages: one effort to keep would-be guests engaged during a period of stay-at-home orders and border closures.
  One&Only's coloring books are inspired by its resorts in Australia's Wolgan Valley (images include wombats, kangaroos) and in Los Cabos, Mexico (sea turtles, sharks). Xanterra Travel Collection, which operates Yellowstone National Park and several other parks in the United States, is transporting humpback whales and bighorn sheep to family rooms across the country.
  The Leading Hotels of the World, a collection of independent luxury hotels and resorts, teamed with the Delaware-based artist Dallas Shaw to depict sketches of bucket-list stays like the Grand Hotel Fasano in northern Italy. And Elizabeth Sutton, an artist based in New York City, turned St. Bart's, Aspen and other jet-setter destinations into a coloring book for Embark Beyond, a luxury travel agency.
  ''Painting is always a way for me to escape, so I figured, why not offer the same to the world?'' said Ms Sutton. ''It's an escape through colorful and happy artworks to inspirational destinations around the globe.''
  Now it's your turn to escape, by putting your creative spin on some of our best travel photography from Zadar, Croatia, to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic. Download, print and share the results on Instagram, by tagging @nytimestravel to have your work featured.

2020/5/17,Color The World From Home,Section D; Column 0; Travel Desk; Pg. 9,"By mid-March, the staff at the Rockland Psychiatric Center in Orangeburg, N.Y., was growing frustrated.
Patients in the center's two inpatient buildings were continuing to gather for daily group therapy sessions, making social distancing difficult, and some workers believed they needed to stop. There were not enough test kits or protective gear, workers said. And some worried that patients being transferred from hospitals in New York City had not been adequately screened for the coronavirus.
The administration soon convened town halls to discuss the concerns. Employees were told that they should not be taking hand sanitizer or masks out of the hospital, but some complained that little of either was available anyway, according to people who were present. Soon patients and staff members began getting sick, including the medical chief.
Now, at least 30 Covid-19 deaths have been recorded in the state's system of 23 psychiatric centers, and roughly a third of them have been at Rockland. State officials said 10 patients at Rockland had died, and union officials said one employee was also dead because of the virus.
More than 13 percent of Rockland's patient population is confirmed to have or suspected of having Covid-19.
The state's other hospital hit hardest by the pandemic is the Pilgrim Psychiatric Center in Suffolk County, where nine patients have died, according to the state. Nearly a fifth of the patients are either confirmed or suspected cases of Covid-19.
The New York Times interviewed clinicians, union officials and employees with a wide range of jobs at the two hospitals, from nursing to food services, and reviewed a number of internal documents. Many of the employees spoke on condition of anonymity for fear of losing their state jobs.
âThe staff is getting sick constantly. We are severely depleted in staff,â?one Rockland clinician said.
Tyjuana Parker, the vice president of the union local that represents civil service employees at Rockland, has been working at the hospital because of staffing shortages. âAll of us could be walking around here with it,â?she said. âWe don't know. It's a lot of fear.â?Psychiatric hospitals present special challenges to the strictures of social distancing, since many patients are allowed to come and go in and out of the center, and once inside they are not cloistered.
Group therapy sessions are a central part of many patients' routines. âPrior to this crisis, they would talk with their peers, play cards, play bingo, do normal recreational activities,â?a nurse at Rockland said. Now such things are on hold.
The patient population is already at high risk. âBecause of the medications they take, their immunity is already compromised,â?the nurse said.
James Plastiras, a spokesman for the state's Office of Mental Health, which oversees the two hospitals, said in a statement that the agency âhas taken numerous actions to protect staff and patients and reduce the risk of exposure in our facilities.â?He said the state had provided face masks to staff members and patients, bolstered screening procedures for new admissions and eliminated group therapy sessions for the duration of the crisis.
Rockland and Pilgrim are among the oldest of the state's psychiatric hospitals, with both opening in 1931. In the 1950s, Pilgrim alone had nearly 14,000 patients, its own power plant and fire and police departments. Rockland had a bowling alley and was decorated with W.P.A. murals. Both were referenced in Allen Ginsberg's beat poetry classic âHowl.â?Today, after decades of deinstitutionalization aimed at curbing the warehousing of the mentally ill, the hospitals are ghosts of their former selves, their sprawling campuses strewn with shuttered buildings (much of the show âOrange is the New Blackâ?was shot at Rockland). The two centers have about 600 patients combined.
As at so many facilities that house people closely together â?in particular the nation's nursing homes, where at least 7,000 have died amid the pandemic â?workers find themselves unexpectedly on the front lines of a public-health crisis.
âIt just hit,â?said Arnold Jones, who has worked at Pilgrim for 33 years and now heads the Civil Service Employees Association local that staffs the center. âNew York is a hot spot, and Suffolk County is a hot spot within the hot spot. So there's a lot going on here.â?At Rockland, like at other hospitals, supplies of personal protective equipment have been a flash point. On March 27, the executive director of the facility, Janet Monroe, emailed the staff: âWe had a call from our central office where now we are required to account for PPE inventory and use daily,â?she wrote, adding that the center âwill not be giving out masks as a daily routine.â?Instead, infection control nurses would guide how such equipment would be used.
âThey've got my members spraying Lysol on masks, and yet they're saying everything is OK,â?said Wayne Spence, the head of the Public Employees Federation, the union that represents nurses and clinicians at the center.
He said his union had given 1,500 masks to Rockland alone, taking on the unusual role of providing medical equipment to its members. The union has also spent nearly $170,000 on hotel rooms for nurses, he said, largely because the workers do not want to infect their families. Forty of the 238 nurses at Rockland are confirmed to have Covid-19.
âBuying this stuff is almost like a drug deal,â?Mr. Spence said of protective gear. âYou're worried people will outbid you.
âSo, securing the masks has been a problem. Even though the governor has said members are supposed to get one mask per day, it's more like one mask per week. That's what our members are telling us.â?The civil service union has warmer relations with the Cuomo administration â?its workers have a contract, while Public Employees Federation negotiators have been at loggerheads with the state over a new deal â?and officials said they felt their workers had been provided with adequate protective equipment. But they were also struggling to maintain staffing levels.
âThere's just a fear factor,â?said Ms. Parker, the Rockland union vice president. âThose coming in here should get hazardous pay.â?On April 3, the commissioner of the state Office of Mental Health, Ann Marie T. Sullivan, told the work force that, while the agency had faced âevery level of catastrophesâ?over the decades, the pandemic was âchallenging us in a way that a blizzard never could.â?She asked for a moment of silence every day at 3 p.m. to reflect on the workers, family members and friends who had been lost.
Still, many fretted that so little attention had been focused on their plight.
âNo one ever talks about what we do,â?Mr. Jones said, adding, âthey treat us the same way they treat the mentally ill. They want to forget us.â?PHOTO: Nearly a fifth of the patients at Pilgrim Psychiatric Center on Long Island are confirmed to have or suspected of having Covid-19.

Good morning.
It's been slightly more than a year since what we used to call the novel coronavirusÂ was first detected in California.
Not long after those first cases were found, experts began warning about how it would disproportionately hurt poorer people, whose jobs were likely to be deemed essential, and who were likely to be members of communities of color.
But what's been less discussed is the role of deeply rooted inequality â?long magnified in California â?in driving the rampant spread of the virus.
Over the weekend, my colleagues on The Times's Graphics desk and I published a piece looking at how that has played out in Los Angeles County, the epicenter of the pandemic in the United States, neighborhood by neighborhood.
[See the full story and explore the map of Los Angeles County.]
While it's perhaps unsurprising at this point that lower-income, predominantly Latino neighborhoods have been hit harder by the virus than richer, whiter communities, the interactive map shows in stark relief the differences.
It also illustrates clearly how Los Angeles is defined by âprofound inequities that overlap with geography,â?as Raphael Sonenshein, executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at Cal State Los Angeles, put it in a tweet.
There has been much focus on how much individuals are adhering to public health directives, but as we reported, for the essential workers who can't shelter, and who can't afford enough space to isolate if they or their loved ones get sick, even following guidelines to the letter isn't protection if the virus is everywhere in their neighborhood.
âWhat we're seeing, still, is that a lot of families don't have any other choice but to continue business as usual,â?said Laura Hidalgo, the leader of a Covid-19 outreach team for Meet Each Need With Dignity, a nonprofit group based in Pacoima.
In Pacoima â?a predominantly Latino neighborhood in the San Fernando Valley where much of our story is set â?one in five residents has been infected with Covid-19, compared with one in 24 residents of much whiter Santa Monica. Pacoima's median household income is about $56,000, compared with $97,000 in Santa Monica.
If you explore the map, other similar contrasts show up: In El Sereno, a rapidly gentrifying Los Angeles neighborhood with a median household income of about $57,000, one in seven residents have been infected. In the neighboring South Pasadena, a small city of tree-lined streets that often shows up in movies as an idyllic American suburb, one in 22 residents have been infected. The median household income is roughly $106,000.
Daniel Flaming, president of the nonprofit Economic Roundtable, told me that âincome polarizationâ?within Los Angeles County, coupled with the fact that a large number of the region's lower-paid workers are in service industries where they must interact with customers, has made the surge in the county, the nation's most populous, particularly intense.
[See the Covid risk in your county. Hint: It's probably high, if you live in California.]
But if you zoom in or out, the patterns, the inequities, repeat.
As one reader pointed out on Twitter, the city of Long Beach also has lower case rates in its wealthier, whiter east side ZIP codes, according to the city's health and human services department website. (Over all, as our map shows, one in 10 Long Beach residents has gotten Covid-19.)
And on a larger scale, researchers for the Community and Labor Center at the University of California, Merced, wrote in a July policy briefthat California's summer surge was hammering counties with high concentrations of low-wage workers, including in the Central Valley, where relatively high case rates have persisted throughout the pandemic.
Gov. Gavin Newsom's administration and state lawmakers have scrambled to blunt the effects of the pandemic, imposing dozens ofrules for employers; starting programs to give essential workers, like in health care or agriculture, access to free hotel rooms to isolate; and introducing other initiatives aimed at getting aid to the most vulnerable.
Most recently,legislators passed a bill allocating billions in federal pandemic aid to help tenants pay back rent and extending what many advocates have said are desperately needed eviction protections.
[Read more about the extended eviction moratorium.]
But many of those regulations haven't been sufficiently enforced, said Edward Flores, an associate professor at U.C. Merced, who was the lead author of the policy brief. And some of the state's most vulnerable essential workers, those who are undocumented, largely haven't had access to aid.
It's all worth considering as the state moves through its latest attempt at reopening, including in Los Angeles, where over the weekend, restaurants and a host of other businesses were able to reopen outdoors or with restrictions.
Because, as experts have said time and again, when one part of the community is being hit hard, it puts everyone at risk.

2021/2/1,Mapping Los Angeles's Unequal Covid-19 Surge California Today,US,"As schools across the United States debate whether children will be able to attend classes in person amid an ongoing pandemic, only about half of the states are allowing teachers to get a shot of the Covid-19 vaccine.
The New York Times tracks vaccine eligibility rules in all 50 states and found that at least 24 states and Washington, D.C., are providing shots to some teachers of kindergarten through high school, though some of those states only consider teachers eligible for the vaccine in certain counties. 
  In West Virginia, teachers are eligible for the vaccine only if they are age 50 or older. In Montana, a limited number of teachers are allowed to get shots if they have specific medical conditions. In certain states like Texas and Florida, officials have ordered schools to reopen for in-person learning, but teachers have not been made eligible for shots. Of the 15 counties with the worst coronavirus outbreaks now, more than half are in Texas.
  And even in states where teachers are allowed to get shots in any county, a sudden expansion of vaccine eligibility, combined with a limited supply of doses, has made it difficult for some to make appointments. For example, Arizona, which currently has the second-highest statewide outbreak, has said teachers may receive the vaccine. But with a slower-than-average vaccine rollout, some educators remain at risk.
  As more contagious virus variants emerge and spread, how quickly states can administer doses from a limited vaccine supply to teachers has become a critical part of the argument about how best to reopen school systems across the nation.
  Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, weighed in on the debate on Wednesday, explaining that there is increasing data to suggest that schools can reopen safely, even if teachers are not able to get shots.
  ''Vaccination of teachers is not a prerequisite for safe reopening of schools,'' she said during a White House briefing.Reporting was contributed by Mitch Smith, Jordan Allen, Alex Lemonides, Brillian Bao, Alyssa Burr, Brandon Dupre, Benjamin Guggenheim, Barbara Harvey, Lauryn Higgins, Laney Pope, Cierra S.

Then they will share their own observations about learning during the Covid-19 crisis.
Students in U.S. high schools can get free digital access to The New York Times until Sept. 1, 2021.
Lesson Overview
Featured Article: â?3,000 School Districts, 13,000 Approaches to Teaching During Covidâ?by Kate Taylor
In a series called âSchools in the Pandemic: A Report Card,â?The New York Times closely examined seven school districts across the country in an attempt to see how public schools are navigating the pandemic. The featured article is the introduction to that series.
In this lesson, you will learn about what going to public school looks like right now and how it is affecting students. Then you will share your experiences about learning during the Covid-19 crisis and have a chance to read more about one of the seven districts The Times covered.
Note: The featured article, and all seven related articles, are available in English and Spanish.
Warm Up
How well is your school district handling teaching and learning during the coronavirus pandemic?
Create a report card that assesses your school or district's Covid-19 response. What grade would you give it why?
If you are in a classroom context, share your grades and reasoning with a small group and discuss what you notice and wonder. How similar are your scores? What criteria appear to be most important to you based on your explanations? Is it how much students are learning? Their mental health status? The school's safety protocols? Equity across different groups?
If you want to change your grade after discussing with your classmates, do that now and explain why you changed your mind.
Questions for Writing and Discussion
Read the article, then answer the following questions:
1. Kate Taylor writes that what it means to go to public school in the United States during a pandemic âlooks so different in different parts of the country.â?What evidence does she use to support that statement?
2. Ms. Taylor lists some figures about students and schools that are not being officially tracked. Which of those data points is most interesting to you? Why do you wish we had more information about that particular figure?
3. Ms. Taylor writes, âThe disruption of education, like so much else about the pandemic, has not affected everyone equally.â?Choose one example from the article that illustrates this point.
4. What resources and services â?beyond education â?do some students rely on in school? How has the pandemic made it harder for students to access those resources?
5. What do we know about how the pandemic has affected young people's mental health?
6. According to education experts, what are some of the conditions under which schools can open safely? What does, or what would, make you feel safe going to school?
7. What are some expectations about what might happen to schools in the next several months through the 2021-22 school year? What do you predict will happen?
Going Further
Option 1: Tell us about your school's Covid-19 response.
Imagine The New York Times has contacted you to find out more about what's going on in your school or district for its âSchools in the Pandemicâ?series. What would you want The Times to know about your experience?
You can report on anything you want, but if you need ideas, you might consider some of the following questions:
    â?What type of learning is your school or district using during the pandemic? In-person? Remote? A hybrid? Something else? Do you agree with the decision your district has made about in-person or virtual learning? Why or why not?
    â?What is helping you to learn this year? What is making learning harder?
    â?Have there been cases of Covid-19 in your school or in your community? How has your school responded? How does the response make you feel about the safety of attending school in person?
    â?Do you think students are succeeding â?and struggling â?equally in your school? Or has this year been harder or easier for certain groups of students?
    â?If you are attending school in person, what safety measures are students and staff members expected to take? Does everyone respect these rules?
    â?Who is making decisions about Covid responses in your school district? Are students, parents, teachers, administrators and district officials all in agreement?
    â?What is one change you would like to see at your school when it comes to teaching and learning during this time?
Write a paragraph that highlights what you think are the most important points about your school or district's handling of the pandemic.
Another option? Use these same questions to interview a classmate about his or her learning experience and summarize the main ideas. How similar or different are your experiences to one another? Why do you think that is? What can you learn by talking to other students about what it's like for them to go to school right now?
Option 2: Research other school districts around the country.
The featured article was the introductory piece to a longer series about schools during the coronavirus pandemic. Choose one other article from the series to read:
Los Angeles: Teachers and students struggle with âno human contact.â?Cherokee County, Ga.: Schools vowed to stay open, until staffing ran out.
Edison, N.J.: The pandemic has brought a new teaching style.
Washington, D.C.: Teachers are going in search of missing students.
Providence, R.I.: Unlike in many cities, most children are in classrooms.
Wausau, Wis.: Parents revolted after the board voted to keep schools closed.
Lubbock County, Texas: What a tiny district did to keep students from failing.
After reading, answer these questions:
    â?What are three struggles the district is facing?
    â?What are two solutions or strategies that the district has put in place to try to support students and the staff?
    â?What is one quotation that you found particularly meaningful?
    â?What is one connection you can make between the district featured in the article and your own district?

2021/1/22,"Lesson of the Day: '13,000 School Districts, 13,000 Approaches to Teaching During Covid' current events",LEARNING,"A New York Times video investigation reveals new details about the death of Dr. Li Wenliang, a national hero who faced censorship after sounding an early alarm on Covid-19.
In early 2020, in the Chinese city of Wuhan, Dr. Li Wenliang lay in a hospital bed with a debilitating fever. He was no ordinary patient, and even then â?before Covid had its name â?he feared that this was no ordinary ailment.
Dr. Li was widely regarded in China as a heroic truth-teller. He had been punished by the authorities for trying to warn others about the virus, and then, in a terrible turn, had become severely sickened by it. Weeks later, he would become China's most famous fatality of the emerging pandemic. He was 34.
His death set off an outpouring of grief and anger on a scale and intensity rarely seen in China. More than two years later, Dr. Li remains a galvanizing figure, a symbol of frustration with the government's suppression of independent voices. His profile on the Chinese social media site, Weibo, regularly receives hundreds of comments a week, and has become a place where people pay tribute and share their personal stories.
A government investigation into the circumstances around Dr. Li's death concluded in a report that the Wuhan Central Hospital had spared no effort to try to save him. But a more complete picture of his medical care and his treatment by the authorities has remained elusive. 
The New York Times's Visual Investigations team has now filled in some of these gaps with an exclusive interview with one of Dr. Li's colleagues. He provided a firsthand account of Dr. Li's final hours, describing the resuscitation measures that were used and discussed. We are referring to him only as Dr. B because he is afraid of reprisals from the Chinese government. The Times talked to Dr. B via video, and verified his identity with public information.
The Times also obtained and examined internal memos from Wuhan Central Hospital and Dr. Li's medical records, some of which backed up Dr. B's account. The medical records have been verified by experts and contain details that match publicly available information. Eight U.S.-based Chinese medical experts, who have experience treating Covid patients or have practiced in Chinese hospitals, reviewed the medical records for The Times.
We found no evidence his medical care was compromised. But these documents, along with Dr. B's account and experts' analysis, reveal important new details about his illness and treatment.
Taken together they show how Dr. Li spent his last 39 days going up against a deadly virus â?and navigating government attempts to censor him.
An Acute Illness
In early 2020, the virus was spreading rapidly in Wuhan, the city in China where the pandemic first took hold. Dr. Li checked into the hospital on Jan. 12 with a fever, a lung infection and other symptoms. According to several of the doctors who reviewed his medical records for The Times, by the third day, Dr. Li was seriously ill and required oxygen support.
âHe was infected with an early variant of the virus, so the illness started acutely, its course was life threatening and it developed very fast,â?said Dr. Wu Yuanfei, a virologist at UMass Chan Medical School in Worcester, Massachusetts.
The experts said that based on the records, the treatment Dr. Li received, in general, followed the norms of that time for managing the symptoms of coronavirus patients.
A little over a week into Dr. Li's hospital stay, his doctors wrote that he was struggling mentally and diagnosed him as being in a depressive state, a detail that has not been reported. The record did not attribute his emotional condition to any specific factors, but noted that Dr. Li had lost his appetite and couldn't sleep at night.
He was kept in an isolation ward, allowed to communicate with his family only by video chat. He had just weeks earlier been disciplined by the police for warning friends in a private group on WeChat, a Chinese social media service, about the new virus that was spreading through the city. His employer, Wuhan Central Hospital where he worked as an eye doctor, had made him write a letter of apology, the content of which was obtained by The Times.
Despite the official warnings, on Jan. 27, 2020, Dr. Li gave an anonymous interview to a prominent Chinese newspaper, describing how he had been reprimanded for trying to raise the alarm. Eventually, he revealed his identity on social media, and instantly became a folk hero. From his hospital bed, he took more interviews and said he hoped to recover soon to join medical workers fighting the outbreak.
Deterioration and Attempts at Resuscitation
But on Feb. 5, Dr. Li's condition deteriorated severely â?his pneumonia grew worse, his breathing became extremely labored.
That afternoon, Dr. Li's doctors ordered several tests of his lungs and heart, his medical records show. According to Dr. Yuan Jin, a pulmonary and critical care doctor at Good Samaritan Medical Center in Brockton, Massachusetts, these exams suggest that Li Wenliang's medical team was responding to a worsened condition.
By the morning of Feb. 6, doctors wrote in the progress notes that Dr. Li was at risk of multiple organ failure. Several physicians we spoke to said that Dr. Li's condition was so serious that his medical team should have at this point, or before it, considered intubating him and placed him on a ventilator â?a higher level of oxygen support.
The records indicate that Dr. Li had earlier been given oxygen through a nasal tube and then an additional oxygen mask. His medical team also tried to use a noninvasive ventilator on Jan. 19, but wrote that âthe patient could not tolerate.â?It is unclear why Dr. Li was not intubated. Some doctors are more reluctant to intubate young patients; sometimes the patients themselves refuse it. To this day, there is no consensus on when invasive ventilators should be used on Covid-19 patients.
On Feb. 6, Dr. Li went into cardiac arrest at around 7:20 p.m. Though his daily progress note did not explicitly say that his heart stopped, it recorded that the medical team started performing CPR â?a procedure that is applied in such an emergency. They intubated him at that point, a common practice during resuscitation. The note said his pupils were not responding to light.
According to the medical records, doctors tried to revive Dr. Li for over seven and a half hours, but his heart never restarted.
The government investigation said doctors placed Dr. Li on extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Also known as ECMO, it is a last resort, invasive treatment involving a machine that siphons blood out of the patient, runs it through an oxygenator and pumps it back into the body.
According to Dr. B, who arrived at Dr. Li's intensive care ward around 9 p.m., about two hours after Dr. Li entered cardiac arrest, the hospital's leadership pushed the medical team to use ECMO because it wanted to show the public that no effort had been spared.
But several doctors in the room argued that by that point it was too late for it to have been of any use, an assessment that six physicians we talked to agreed with. Dr. B also said putting Dr. Li on ECMO, given its invasive nature, would have been an âinsult to his body.â?Dr. B left the room around midnight. He said ECMO had not been used because an instrument to perform the procedure was not available. It is unclear whether it was ultimately used after he left.
There is also no indication in the doctors' orders from that night that the procedure was ever administered.
But for some reason, the daily progress notes say ECMO was used. It was the only discrepancy of this kind found in the medical records. 
The Death of Dr. Li
That night, conflicting messages about Dr. Li's condition â?some released by state media outlets, then deleted â?generated confusion. At 10:40 p.m., a state-run publication, Life Times, said that he had died at 9:30 p.m.
It was nearly 4 a.m. the next morning, Feb. 7, when the hospital finally announced Dr. Li's death. It said he died at 2:58 a.m. The government's investigation cited an electrocardiography performed at this time that showed he had flatlined.
Our investigation found that among the records was an echocardiogram report around 9:10 p.m. the previous evening that showed that his heart had stopped beating.
âI think Dr. Li Wenliang had already died by the time I saw him around 9 p.m. on Feb. 6,â?Dr. B said. He added: âThe normal process at this point would have been to pronounce him dead.â?âThey dragged their feet for so long over the announcement. It's like the hospital really did not treat us as human beings,â?he said. For Dr. B, going public with his version of events was an attempt to get his story out and honor Dr. Li's legacy.
The Times made multiple attempts to contact Dr. Li's medical team, but none agreed to answer questions. The press office of Wuhan Central Hospital told The Times that it was not accepting interviews from international media outlets. China's National Supervisory Commission, the country's top disciplinary body investigating Dr. Li's death, did not respond to requests for comment. The Chinese Embassy in Washington, D.C. did not respond to requests for comment.

2022/10/6,How a Chinese Doctor Who Warned of Covid-19 Spent His Final Days Visual Investigations,WORLD; asia,"Brian Boyd, who fatally hit Lisa Banes on a Manhattan crosswalk, tried to explain his actions in court, angering the judge. ''I did beep my horn,'' he said.
A State Supreme Court judge on Wednesday sentenced a scooter driver to as much as three years in prison for fatally hitting an actress, Lisa Banes, after the man tried to avoid blame for the accident following an earlier admission of guilt. 
  Brian Boyd, 27, attempted to claim in court -- contrary to his September guilty pleas for manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident -- that he had not acted recklessly in June 2021 when he ran a red light and struck Ms. Banes on a West 64th Street crosswalk. Ms. Banes, 65, who appeared in the movie ''Gone Girl'' as well as dozens of films, television programs and stage shows, died of her injuries 10 days later.
  ''I did beep my horn,'' Mr. Boyd said. ''I did slow down.''
  Angered, Judge Gregory Carro reminded Mr. Boyd that after finding and leaving Ms. Banes lying face down and bleeding on the pavement, he immediately drove four miles north to a Harlem shop that repaired his electric scooter while he drank a Heineken beer.
  ''You know what? I'll give you your plea back,'' Judge Carro said. ''You want to go to trial?''
  Mr. Boyd said that he did not.
  Assistant District Attorney Erin LaFarge said that Mr. Boyd had deserved more prison time. She said Mr. Boyd's attempt to rescind his plea showed that he refused to acknowledge his recklessness or show remorse. She reminded Judge Carro that a year before fatally striking Ms. Banes, Mr. Boyd crashed a Revel electric moped that he was driving without a license, seriously injuring himself and his girlfriend.
  ''He has not learned anything from this experience, and that is a terrifying thought,'' said Ms. LaFarge.
  Ms. Banes studied at New York's Juilliard School in the 1970s, and had a string of leading Off Broadway roles in the 1980s. She made her Broadway debut in the 1988 Neil Simon comedy ''Rumors'' and performed in more than 80 television and film productions, including opposite Tom Cruise in the 1988 film ''Cocktail'' and Ben Affleck in ''Gone Girl.''
  ''Lisa Banes was a beloved friend, family and community member whose life was tragically cut short,'' Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, said Wednesday afternoon.
  In court, the victim's wife, Kathryn Kranhold, dressed in a dark suit, read an emotional statement aloud. At the time of the accident, she and Ms. Banes had traveled from their home in Los Angeles to New York City for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic and were commemorating their first date, a walk in Central Park around Memorial Day in 2006. Married at City Hall a few years later, Ms. Kranhold recalled how much her late wife loved apple pie, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Kamala Harris.
  She recalled finding Ms. Banes bloodied and in a coma at the hospital. ''My life stopped at that moment,'' she said.
  Calling Mr. Boyd ''heartless and reckless,'' she pleaded with the judge to sentence him to a long prison term for the sake of public safety.
  ''Lisa saw him coming at her, but she couldn't move fast enough, nobody could move fast enough,'' Ms. Kranhold said.
  Mr. Boyd's lawyer, Angela Kerins, protested to Judge Carro that her client had never been convicted of a felony, and that he was ready to accept his sentence for the sake of his family, members of whom were in the courtroom with tears in their eyes.
  ''His family is prepared for this. His daughter is prepared for this,'' she said.
  Judge Carro said that he wanted a sentence that might act as a ''general deterrent'' to careless drivers.
  ''This city obviously has a problem with unlicensed scooters,'' he said. ''This is what happens when you recklessly drive those pretty powerful new motorbikes.''
  However, he said he would honor the terms of Mr. Boyd's plea agreement. He asked if Mr. Boyd had anything to say:
  ''I'm extremely sorry,'' Mr. Boyd said. ''I don't really have the words except 'I'm sorry.'''

2022/12/1,Scooter Driver Who Struck and Killed Actress Gets Up to 3 Years,Section; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk,"Brian Boyd, who fatally hit Lisa Banes on a Manhattan crosswalk, tried to explain his actions in court, angering the judge. âI did beep my horn,â?he said.
A State Supreme Court judge on Wednesday sentenced a scooter driver to as much as three years in prison for fatally hitting an actress, Lisa Banes, after the man tried to avoid blame for the accident following an earlier admission of guilt.
Brian Boyd, 27, attempted to claim in court â?contrary to his September guilty pleas for manslaughter and leaving the scene of an accident â?that he had not acted recklessly in June 2021 when he ran a red light and struck Ms. Banes on a West 64th Street crosswalk. Ms. Banes, 65, who appeared in the movie âGone Girlâ?as well as dozens of films, television programs and stage shows, died of her injuries 10 days later.
âI did beep my horn,â?Mr. Boyd said. âI did slow down.â?Angered, Judge Gregory Carro reminded Mr. Boyd that after finding and leaving Ms. Banes lying face down and bleeding on the pavement, he immediately drove four miles north to a Harlem shop that repaired his electric scooter while he drank a Heineken beer.
âYou know what? I'll give you your plea back,â?Judge Carro said. âYou want to go to trial?â?Mr. Boyd said that he did not.
Assistant District Attorney Erin LaFarge said that Mr. Boyd had deserved more prison time. She said Mr. Boyd's attempt to rescind his plea showed that he refused to acknowledge his recklessness or show remorse. She reminded Judge Carro that a year before fatally striking Ms. Banes, Mr. Boyd crashed a Revel electric moped that he was driving without a license, seriously injuring himself and his girlfriend.
âHe has not learned anything from this experience, and that is a terrifying thought,â?said Ms. LaFarge.
Ms. Banes studied at New York's Juilliard School in the 1970s, and had a string of leading Off Broadway roles in the 1980s. She made her Broadway debut in the 1988 Neil Simon comedy âRumorsâ?and performed in more than 80 television and film productions, including opposite Tom Cruise in the 1988 film âCocktailâ?and Ben Affleck in âGone Girl.â?âLisa Banes was a beloved friend, family and community member whose life was tragically cut short,â?Alvin L. Bragg, the Manhattan district attorney, said Wednesday afternoon.
In court, the victim's wife, Kathryn Kranhold, dressed in a dark suit, read an emotional statement aloud. At the time of the accident, she and Ms. Banes had traveled from their home in Los Angeles to New York City for the first time since the Covid-19 pandemic and were commemorating their first date, a walk in Central Park around Memorial Day in 2006. Married at City Hall a few years later, Ms. Kranhold recalled how much her late wife loved apple pie, the Los Angeles Dodgers and Kamala Harris.
She recalled finding Ms. Banes bloodied and in a coma at the hospital. âMy life stopped at that moment,â?she said.
Calling Mr. Boyd âheartless and reckless,â?she pleaded with the judge to sentence him to a long prison term for the sake of public safety.
âLisa saw him coming at her, but she couldn't move fast enough, nobody could move fast enough,â?Ms. Kranhold said.
Mr. Boyd's lawyer, Angela Kerins, protested to Judge Carro that her client had never been convicted of a felony, and that he was ready to accept his sentence for the sake of his family, members of whom were in the courtroom with tears in their eyes.
âHis family is prepared for this. His daughter is prepared for this,â?she said.
Judge Carro said that he wanted a sentence that might act as a âgeneral deterrentâ?to careless drivers.
âThis city obviously has a problem with unlicensed scooters,â?he said. âThis is what happens when you recklessly drive those pretty powerful new motorbikes.â?However, he said he would honor the terms of Mr. Boyd's plea agreement. He asked if Mr. Boyd had anything to say:

2022/11/30,Scooter Driver Who Struck and Killed Actress Gets Up to 3 Years,NYREGION,"With the coronavirus confining people to their homes, coloring books for both children and adults have experienced a renewed popularity. Here are some pages inspired by a few of our favorite travel photos.
Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. For the latest updates, read The New York Times's Covid-19 coverage here.
The Times's Travel section is tasked with bringing you the world. But with the world on pause, we're inviting you to explore far-flung destinations through another, more interactive medium: coloring pages, inspired by some of our favorite travel photos.
Coloring books â?for children and adults alike â?have emerged with a new zeitgeist as an unbreakable, noiseless and screen-free indoor activity; AdAge named them one of the key creative trends to emerge from the pandemic.
They are also a potentially helpful antidote to the blahs.
âColoring books have been shown to reduce stress and anxiety while promoting relaxation as they help users remain present and focused, said Martha Dorn, the executive director of The Art Therapy Project, a nonprofit based in New York City. âRepetitive strokes provide temporary relief from life stressors, and the focus required to color can keep negative emotions away.â?Many hotels and other travel companies have jumped into the coloring-book game through downloadable, print-at-home pages: one effort to keep would-be guests engaged during a period of stay-at-home orders and border closures.
One&amp;Only's coloring books are inspired by its resorts in Australia's Wolgan Valley (images include wombats, kangaroos) and in Los Cabos, Mexico (sea turtles, sharks). Xanterra Travel Collection, which operates Yellowstone National Park and several other parks in the United States, is transporting humpback whales and bighorn sheep to family rooms across the country.
The Leading Hotels of the World, a collection of independent luxury hotels and resorts, teamed with the Delaware-based artist Dallas Shaw to depict sketches of bucket-list stays like the Grand Hotel Fasano in northern Italy. And Elizabeth Sutton, an artist based in New York City, turned St. Bart's, Aspen and other jet-setter destinations into a coloring book for Embark Beyond, a luxury travel agency.
âPainting is always a way for me to escape, so I figured, why not offer the same to the world?â?said Ms Sutton. âIt's an escape through colorful and happy artworks to inspirational destinations around the globe.â?Now it's your turn to escape, by putting your creative spin on some of our best travel photography from Zadar, Croatia, to Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic.

2020/6/1,"While at Home, Let's Color the World",TRAVEL,"In this lesson students will analyze graphs, maps and data to better understand the toll of the pandemic on incarcerated populations.
Note to Teachers: We have a related âWhat's Going On in This Graph?â?activity about Covid-19 in prisons.
Lesson Overview
Featured Article: âIncarcerated and Infected: How the Virus Tore Through the U.S. Prison Systemâ?Prisons were not built to handle pandemics. In fact, it's hard to imagine worse conditions for preventing the spread of the coronavirus than those in prisons: large groups of people living together, in crowded indoor spaces, with a security staff that comes and goes regularly.
A recent New York Times report found that the rate of Covid-19 cases in United States correctional institutions was more than three times the rate in the general population. A follow-up report found that the infection rate in detention centers run by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) was 20 times that of the general population.
This data raises important questions, both statistical and moral. In this lesson, you will analyze the pandemic's impact on correctional facilities across the United States â?and close to home. Then you will have the opportunity to weigh the ethics of prioritizing â?or not prioritizing â?prison communities for vaccination, and to explore the realities of statistical bias in data collection.
Warm-Up
Look closely at the graph below. These connected-dot plots compare the coronavirus infection rates in each state's entire population with the rates in its state prisons, including for incarcerated people and prison staff.
After looking closely at the graph above (or at this full-size image), answer these four questions:
    â?What do you notice?
    â?What do you wonder?
    â?What impact does this situation have on you and your community?
    â?What's going on in this graph? Write a headline that captures the graph's main idea.
The questions are intended to build on one another, so try to answer them in order. You can post your answers in the comments section of our âWhat's Going On in This Graph?â?activity.
Questions for Writing and Discussion
Read the beginning of the article (until you reach the graph above), then answer the following questions:
1. The graph in the warm-up activity reveals the disproportionately high Covid rates in state prisons across the United States compared with the general population. Why are correctional facilities âamong the nation's most dangerous places when it comes to infections from the coronavirusâ?
2. How did The New York Times collect this data?
3. After reading this introductory section, what are your reactions to what you learned about Covid in prisons? Why?
Math Activity #1: Counts and Rates
Note to teachers: Answers to the math problems are at the bottom of this post. Classes can do the activity below with any county that has a state or federal correctional facility on the map in the article. They will explore their home county in Math Activity #2.
According to the map âInmate infections in U.S. correctional facilities,â?in the featured article, San Quentin State Prison has had 2,243 Covid-19 cases and 28 Covid-related deaths during the pandemic. The peak number of prisoners over that time was 3,462. The prison is in Marin County, Calif., which has had 13,855 Covid-19 cases and 227 deaths in its general population. According to the Census Bureau, Marin County has 258,826 residents. The following table summarizes this information:
Imagine that a local politician says, âThere have been more than six times as many Covid-19 cases in our county than in the prison. In addition, there have been more than eight times as many deaths. So, let's focus on disease mitigation among the county's citizens, who clearly have been more affected than people in prison.â?Are the numbers in the politician's statement accurate? How might they be misleading?
1. Verify the politician's statistics by showing:
    â?that the Marin County Covid case count is more than six times that of San Quentin.
    â?that the Marin County Covid death count is more than eight times that of San Quentin.
2. Answer the following, in writing or in class discussion:
    â?Even though the politician's statistics are correctly calculated, they may be misleading. What makes them misleading?
3. One way to measure the impact of Covid-19 is by calculating infection and death rates. Two formulas for these statistics are given below:
    â?Calculate and compare the infection rates in San Quentin Prison and Marin County.
    â?Calculate and compare the death rates in San Quentin Prison and Marin County.
4. Answer the following, in writing or in class discussion:
    â?After doing your calculations, what do you notice about the infection and death rates in San Quentin Prison versus Marin County?
    â?How could you respond to the local politician, to help clarify the difference between counts and rates â?and why that difference is important?
Math Activity #2: The Incarcerated and Your Community
Let's find, calculate and interpret measures of Covid-19's spread in your community and in nearby prison facilities. Draw a blank table, similar to the one we used in the warm-up:
First, find the closest prison to your community using the interactive map in the article. Hover your cursor over the circle representing the prison, and then fill in the cells in the table under the ânearby prisonâ?column. (Use the âinmates at peakâ?statistic as the population size.)
Next, open the New York Times Covid-19 database. Navigate to the âCounty trendsâ?section and find your county. Change the menu from âRecent trendsâ?to âAll time.â?Fill in the corresponding cells in the table with the case count and the death count. To find your county's population size, look up your county name in the U.S. Census Bureau's Quick Facts site.
Once you've compiled all the data, respond to the following:
    â?Calculate and compare the infection rates in your county with those in the nearby prison. Which one is higher? Why do you think that is?
    â?Calculate and compare the death rates in your county with those in the nearby prison. Which one is higher? Why do you think that is?
Going Further
Option 1: Weigh the ethics of prioritizing prison communities for vaccination.
Before Covid vaccines were widely available in the United States, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended that prison workers and incarcerated people be placed in early phases of the rollout. Responses were mixed. Read the following two quotes from a March article about how Covid-19 prison vaccination policies differed from state to state:
âThere's no way [the vaccine is] going to go to prisoners before it goes to people who haven't committed any crime.â?â?Jared Polis, Governor of Colorado
âPeople are unwilling to say we should vaccinate people who are incarcerated â?who may have done something bad â?before us. It's like, 'How dare they?' But that's not the question here. It's not what we value or who we value. This is about who is at risk of disease. That's it.â?â?Dr. Jaimie Meyer, associate professor at the Yale School of Medicine
The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices, a panel of independent experts who advise the C.D.C. on its vaccine policies, identified four ethical principles to guide their decision-making process when vaccine supply is limited:
    â?Maximize benefits and minimize harms â?Respect and care for people using the best available data to promote public health and minimize death and severe illness.
    â?Mitigate health inequities â?Reduce health disparities in the burden of Covid-19 disease and death, and make sure everyone has the opportunity to be as healthy as possible.
    â?Promote justice â?Treat affected groups, populations and communities fairly. Remove unfair, unjust and avoidable barriers to Covid-19 vaccination.
    â?Promote transparency â?Make a decision that is clear, understandable and open for review. Allow and seek public participation in the creation and review of the decision processes.
Imagine that you are the governor of your state. Use those four principles to help guide your vaccine prioritization plan and determine what priority status prisoners and prison workers should have as part of the vaccine rollout. What recommendations would you make?
Option 2: Explore the potential for statistical bias.
Let's dig a bit deeper into how these statistics were generated. Reread this paragraph from the article:
The cramped, often unsanitary settings of correctional institutions have been ideal for incubating and transmitting disease. Social distancing is not an option. Testing was not a priority inside prisons early in the pandemic. With little public pressure, political leaders have been slow to confront the spread.
Statistical bias occurs when a method for estimating a quantity, such as using case counts to estimate the total number of infections in a prison, is inaccurate. Biased methods lead to overestimates or underestimates.
    â?Given that testing for the coronavirus was ânot a priority inside prisons early in the pandemic,â?do you think the prison infection rates listed in the article are biased? If so, are they underestimates or overestimates?
Now, let's think about estimating the infection rate outside of prisons.
    â?Think about the testing conditions in your community during the pandemic. Do you think there are people who were infected with Covid-19 who never got tested? Why? Do you believe the overall infection rates listed in the article are biased? If so, are they underestimates or overestimates?
    â?In your opinion, how should we deal with the possibility of statistical bias in the data we analyzed? How much should statistical bias affect our conclusions?
This lesson was written by Dashiell Young-Saver, who is a high school teacher of statistics and the founder of the site Skew the Script. Sharon Hessney, who curates the Learning Network's weekly feature âWhat's Going On in This Graph?â?contributed to the lesson.

2021/5/4,Examining the Math and Ethics of Covid-19 in Prisons current events,LEARNING,"The pandemic hasn't pushed people out of the state as much as rearranged where they reside within it.
Since the earliest days of the pandemic, we've been hearing about Californians abandoning their usual way of life for greener, cheaper pastures.
There are the San Franciscans who weathered lockdown orders in Lake Tahoe, and the Angelenos with new desert cabins in Joshua Tree. Tales abound of Silicon Valley types moving home to Miami and Seattle, or renting acres of land in Idaho.
The story goes like this: The coronavirus and the ability to work remotely have fundamentally reshaped where we want to live â?and large California cities, particularly Los Angeles and San Francisco, are not on the list.
But is any of that actually true?
I'll start with the short answer. There hasn't been an exodus from California, but pandemic forces have shifted where people reside within the state. Those patterns of relocation mirror what we were already seeing before Covid-19, but on overdrive.
Here's how this shakes out.
California's population declined slightly in 2020, but it wasn't because of a mass migration to other states. To blame are coronavirus deaths, a lower birthrate and fewer international arrivals.
In fact, 82 percent of Californians who moved last year stayed in the state, according to a report from the California Policy Lab. That figure has been basically stable over the past five years.
âA lot more people are moving around within the state than they are out of the state,â?Eric McGhee, a senior fellow with the Public Policy Institute of California, told me. âThat movement tends to be within a certain metropolitan area, and a lot of that is people moving to suburbs and exurbs.â?Californians are likely to move from Los Angeles to the Inland Empire or from San Francisco to the fringes of the Bay Area or the Sacramento region, McGhee said. That's because they want cheaper housing but don't want to end up so far away that they need to change jobs.
It's been that way for a long time. These were the largest county-to-county net migrations in California between 2015 and 2019, according to census data:
    â?Los Angeles to San Bernardino (20,809 people)
    â?Los Angeles to Riverside (13,949)
    â?Los Angeles to Orange (11,879)
    â?Alameda to Contra Costa (9,246)
    â?Orange to Riverside (8,282)
    â?Los Angeles to Kern (6,032)
    â?San Diego to Riverside (5,892)
    â?San Francisco to Alameda (5,469)
    â?San Francisco to San Mateo (4,239)
    â?Alameda to San Joaquin (4,134)
With the emergence of the pandemic in 2020, some of these trends kicked into high gear.
The Inland Empire tied Phoenix in 2020 for the biggest gain in households from migration nationwide, The Wall Street Journal recently reported. The flow of humanity into Riverside and San Bernardino Counties increased by 50 percent compared with the previous year.
This reflects Californians' desire to escape the exorbitant home prices of more coastal regions. In Riverside County, the median single-family home price in August was $570,000, compared with $830,070 in Los Angeles County and $1.85 million in San Francisco.
As my colleagues noted in a recent analysis, pricey San Francisco experienced one of the most significant exoduses of the pandemic. While âmigration patterns during the pandemic have looked a lot like migration patterns before it,â?that wasn't the case for San Francisco, they wrote.
In the city, net exits â?the number of people leaving minus the number of people arriving â?increased to 38,800 in the last three quarters of 2020, compared with 5,200 during the same time the previous year, according to the California Policy Lab report. The city lost one-eighth of its total households last year by some estimates.
But perhaps this is good news for those us of fighting the myth of a California exodus: Two-thirds of San Franciscans who fled landed in other parts of the Bay Area and 80 percent stayed in the state.

2021/11/30,How Covid-19 Has Changed Where Californians Live California Today,US,"Rising immunity and modest changes in behavior may explain why cases are declining, but much remains unknown, scientists say.
After a brutal summer surge, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, the coronavirus is again in retreat. 
  The United States is recording roughly 90,000 new infections a day, down more than 40 percent since August. Hospitalizations and deaths are falling, too.
  The crisis is not over everywhere -- the situation in Alaska is particularly dire -- but nationally, the trend is clear, and hopes are rising that the worst is finally behind us.
  Again.
  Over the past two years, the pandemic has crashed over the country in waves, inundating hospitals and then receding, only to return after Americans let their guard down.
  It is difficult to tease apart the reasons that the virus ebbs and flows in this way, and harder still to predict the future.
  But as winter looms, there are real reasons for optimism. Nearly 70 percent of adults are fully vaccinated, and many children under 12 are likely to be eligible for their shots in a matter of weeks. Federal regulators could soon authorize the first antiviral pill for Covid-19.
  ''We are definitely, without a doubt, hands-down in a better place this year than we were last year,'' said Dr. Nahid Bhadelia, director of the Center for Emerging Infectious Diseases Policy and Research at Boston University.
  But the pandemic is not over yet, scientists cautioned. Nearly 2,000 Americans are still dying every day, and another winter surge is plausible. Given how many Americans remain unvaccinated, and how much remains unknown, it is too soon to abandon basic precautions, they said.
  ''We've done this again and again, where we let the foot off the pedal too early,'' Dr. Bhadelia said. ''It behooves us to be a bit more cautious as we're trying to get to that finish line.''
  Crushing the curve
  When the first wave of cases hit the United States in early 2020, there was no Covid vaccine, and essentially no one was immune to the virus. The only way to flatten the proverbial curve was to change individual behavior.
  That is what the first round of stay-at-home orders, business closures, mask mandates and bans on large gatherings aimed to do. There is still debate over which of these measures were most effective, but numerous studies suggest that, collectively, they made a difference, keeping people at home and curbing the growth of case numbers.
  These policies, combined with voluntary social distancing, most likely helped bring the early surges to an end, researchers said.
  ''And then the measures would be lifted, maybe memories would fade,'' said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist at Johns Hopkins University.
  Eventually, cases would rise again, and similar patterns would play out. Businesses and local governments would reimplement restrictions, while people who had begun venturing out into the world again would hunker down and mask up.
  During last winter's surge, for instance, the percentage of Americans who reported going to bars or restaurants or attending large events declined, according to the U.S. Covid-19 Trends and Impact Survey, which has surveyed an average of 44,000 Facebook users daily since April 2020.
  ''The curve is shaped by public awareness,'' Dr. Nuzzo said. ''We're sort of lurching between crisis and complacency.''
  Delta arrived during a period of deep pandemic fatigue, and at a moment when many vaccinated Americans felt as though they could finally relax. Data suggests that the new variant prompted less profound behavioral change than previous waves.
  In mid-July, just 23 percent of Americans said that they always wore a mask in public, the lowest percentage since March 2020, according to the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington, which compiles data from several sources.
  By Aug. 31, the peak of the Delta wave, that figure had risen to 41 percent, although it remained far below the 77 percent of people who reported wearing masks during the winter surge.
  ''If you just look around, people are much more living a normal life or a pre-Covid life,'' said Dr. Christopher Murray, director of the institute.
  Still, even modest changes in behavior can help slow transmission, especially in combination, and Delta prompted changes at both the individual and organizational levels. Schools adopted new precautions, companies postponed reopenings, and organizations canceled events, giving the virus fewer opportunities to spread.
  Meanwhile, more temperate autumn weather arrived, making it possible for Americans in many regions of the country to socialize outside, where the virus is less likely to spread.
  ''We're in a shoulder season, where it's cooler in the South than it is in the middle of the summer and it's warmer in the North than it is in the middle of the winter,'' said David O'Connor, a virologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.
  Indeed, many of the current virus hot spots are in the northernmost parts of the country, from Alaska to Minnesota, where even cooler temperatures may be sending people back inside.
  Increasing immunity
  Behavioral change is a temporary, short-term way to drive cases down. The true end to the pandemic will come through immunity.
  The Delta wave was the first major, national surge to occur after vaccines had become widely available, providing many adults with substantial protection against the virus. (Delta also probably led more Americans to get vaccinated.)
  At the same time, the variant was so infectious that it spread rapidly through vulnerable populations, conferring natural immunity on many unvaccinated Americans.
  Although neither vaccination nor prior infection provides perfect protection against the virus, they dramatically reduce the odds of catching it. So by September, the virus had a substantially harder time finding hospitable hosts.
  ''Delta is running out of people to infect,'' said Jeffrey Shaman, an infectious disease epidemiologist at Columbia University.
  The fact that case numbers are falling does not mean that the country has reached herd immunity, a goal that many scientists now believe is unattainable. But the rising levels of vaccination and infection, combined with more modest behavioral changes, may have been enough to bring the surge to an end.
  ''It's a combination of immunity, but also people being careful,'' said Joshua Salomon, an infectious disease expert and modeler at Stanford University.
  Indeed, scientists said that a combination of factors, which might be different in different parts of the country, would ultimately determine when and why the virus waxed and waned.
  ''The different surges and waves depend on how big were the waves before that one, how many people have been vaccinated, when the schools reopened, the different variants,'' said Alessandro Vespignani, director of the Network Science Institute at Northeastern University in Boston.
  There is some randomness involved, too, especially because small numbers of ''superspreaders'' seem to play a disproportionate role in setting off outbreaks. ''About 10 to 20 percent of the people are responsible for 80 to 90 percent of the infections,'' said Christina Ramirez, a biostatistician at the University of California, Los Angeles.
  That means that two similar communities might find themselves on radically different trajectories simply because one highly infectious person happened to attend a crowded indoor event, fueling a major outbreak.
  Some patterns still defy explanation. In March and April, for instance, Michigan was hit hard by the Alpha variant, Delta's slightly less infectious predecessor.
  Other states were largely spared, for reasons that remain unclear, Dr. Murray said. ''Why was Michigan the only state with a large Alpha surge in spring?'' he said. ''We have no idea.''
  The winter forecast
  What comes next is hard to predict, but cases may not necessarily continue their steady decline, scientists warned.
  Britain and Israel, which both have higher vaccination rates than the United States, are still struggling with outbreaks.
  ''That should be a wake-up call,'' said Michael Osterholm, director of the Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy at the University of Minnesota. ''Do not go back into the pre-Fourth-of-July mind-set again, where everybody thought it was done and over with.''
  Most experts said they would not be surprised to see at least a small increase in cases later this fall or this winter as people begin spending more time indoors and traveling for the holidays.
  But because the vaccines remain highly effective at preventing hospitalization and death, any coming winter spikes may be less catastrophic than last year's.
  ''It's not likely that it will be as deadly as the surge we had last winter, unless we get really unlucky with respect to a new variant,'' Dr. Salomon said.
  The emergence of a new variant remains a wild card, as does the possibility that the protection afforded by vaccination could start to wane more substantially.
  Our own behavior is another source of uncertainty.
  ''Predicting an outbreak is not like predicting the weather, because you're dealing with human behavior,'' said Nicholas Reich, a biostatistician at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst. ''And that's a fundamentally really hard thing to predict: new policies that would come into force, people's reactions to them, new trends on social media, you know -- the list goes on and on.''
  But our behavior is, at least, under our control, and it remains a critical variable as we head into the winter, scientists said. By and large, they did not recommend canceling holiday plans; many said they themselves would be celebrating with friends and relatives. But they did suggest taking sensible precautions.
  There is still time to be vaccinated or encourage loved ones to be vaccinated before Thanksgiving. Wearing masks in certain high-risk settings, hosting events outdoors when the weather is nice and taking rapid Covid tests before holiday gatherings are all common-sense strategies for reducing risk, experts said.
  ''It doesn't mean Lockdown Christmas No. 2,'' said Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at the Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization at the University of Saskatchewan. ''But it does mean that we should all just be mindful that this is not completely over yet.''

2021/10/15,Hopes Are Rising As Brutal Surge Starts to Recede,Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1,"Rising immunity and modest changes in behavior may explain why cases are declining, but much remains unknown, scientists say.
After a brutal summer surge, driven by the highly contagious Delta variant, the coronavirus is again in retreat.
The United States is recording roughly 90,000 new infections a day, down more than 40 percent since August. Hospitalizations and deaths are falling, too.
The crisis is not over everywhere â?the situation in Alaska is particularly dire â?but nationally, the trend is clear, and hopes are rising that the worst is finally behind us.
Again.
Over the past two years, the pandemic has crashed over the country in waves, inundating hospitals and then receding, only to return after Americans let their guard down.
It is difficult to tease apart the reasons that the virus ebbs and flows in this way, and harder still to predict the future.
But as winter looms, there are real reasons for optimism. Nearly 70 percent of adults are fully vaccinated, and many children under 12 are likely to be eligible for their shots in a matter of weeks. Federal regulators could soon authorize the first antiviral pill for Covid-19.

2021/10/14,'Lurching Between Crisis and Complacency': Was This Our Last Covid Surge?,HEALTH,"Thursday: Here's where the state's efforts stand. Also: A call for your adapted Thanksgiving traditions.
Good morning.
In California, we've spent the past several days learning new details about the ways in which some of our leaders have flouted the very same guidelines they've promoted to help keep everyone safe.
That French Laundry dinner Gov. Gavin Newsom apologized for attending? Photos obtained by Fox 11 show it was not as outdoors as you might have thought. As CalMatters reported, two high-powered doctors' association executives were also among the guests.
Oh, and reporters are still trying to figure out which of your elected representatives decided to go to Hawaii for a lavish policy summit, just days after California announced advisories against traveling out of state, because many of them won't own up to being there.
Nevertheless, we are now exactly one week away from Thanksgiving â?a holiday that experts have warned is almost custom tailored to facilitate the spread of the coronavirus.
Both the state and local governments have been announcing new restrictions or reinstating previous ones aimed at getting the surge under control.
Here's what you need to know about restrictions now:
More than 94 percent of the state's population lives in the 41 counties currently under the state's purple tier of restrictions. What does that mean?
It means that many businesses that may have been operating indoors, such as restaurants, movie theaters and museums, must either move everything outdoors or close down.
Hair salons and barber shops can be open indoors with modifications. Shopping malls, stores and swap meets can be open at 25 percent capacity.
Indoor gatherings of any kind are banned and outdoor gatherings can only include people from up to three households.
[See a grid showing what's open and what's closed under each tier on the California Department of Public Health's website.| Look up where your county falls here.]
All that said, individual counties may impose more stringent restrictions than the state mandates.
For instance, officials in Los Angeles County â?which has struggled for months with stubbornly high case loads â?have said that the virus is spreading to dangerous and unsustainable levels.
So, effective Friday, the county is requiring that restaurants operate at half capacity, even outdoors. Also, personal care businesses can't accept walk-ins, and they must provide only services that don't require customers to take their masks off.
As far as outdoor gatherings, which the state guidelines cap at simply three households, Los Angeles County is capping at 15 people.
And if things continue to get worse, officials say they will reimpose a stay-at-home order similar to the one the county implemented in March, which would require people to stay home except to go to essential businesses. (The threshold would be a five-day average of more than 4,000 new cases per day, or if there are more than 1,750 hospitalizations per day.)
San Francisco officials have also paused reopening plans without a state mandate.
[Track coronavirus case numbers and hospitalizations by California county.]
So is there a curfew?
Although earlier this week, Mr. Newsom said he and other state officials were looking at research into whether some kind of statewide curfew could be effective, there is no such curfew right now.
In Los Angeles, however, the county is requiring all restaurants, bar, wineries and nonessential stores to close from 10 p.m. to 6 a.m.
Last week, New York officials announced a similar step, requiring bars and restaurants to close at 10 p.m.
When do we have to wear masks?
The state updated its mask mandate recently to make it slightly more expansive. But for the most part, if you've been following it already you won't have to do anything different.
There are a few exceptions, but, basically, if you're inside somewhere that's not your home, and you're not eating or drinking (which probably won't be the case, given that indoor dining should be closed in most of the state), you should be wearing a mask.
If you're outside, but you're somewhere you may come within six feet of people, you should be wearing a mask. And if you're in a car with someone who doesn't live in your household, you should be wearing a mask.

2020/11/19,What to Know About California 's Covid-19 Restrictions California Today,US,"The state's latest travel restrictions make most hotel or short term lodging illegal. But Airbnb and Vrbo, the biggest home-sharing companies, are sticking to no-refund policies.
Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. For the latest updates, read The New York Times's Covid-19 coverage here. 
  California's new travel restrictions, put in place to help prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed by the pandemic, have thrown vacation planning into reverse as travelers start canceling their lodging reservations. From now until at least Dec. 31, it is illegal for all hotel and short-term rental lodging owners in California to make or honor reservations for people coming from out of state unless they plan to quarantine in place for 14 days or are coming for essential purposes like health care, or infrastructure work. In much of the state, restrictions are even tighter, with only essential travel allowed.
  There's a big split when it comes to cancellation and refund policies, though. Hotel chains by and large are accommodating travelers with full refunds. Many small hotels are doing the same. But some large home-sharing companies, like Airbnb and Vrbo, are telling guests that there is no guarantee they'll get their money back.
  [Sign up for California Today, our daily newsletter from the Golden State.]
  Every aspect of the travel industry has taken a significant hit during the pandemic, but home-sharing companies have had an advantage over hotels -- they are perceived as safer. It's easier to practice social distancing when you have your own entrance and kitchen, and are away from other guests. Short-term rentals have been regarded as a pandemic getaway for those who are working or learning remotely and can still afford a trip.
  Airbnb, whose recent I.P.O. garnered the co-founder and chief executive, Brian Chesky, around $11 billion based on the company's overall valuation, has one of the strictest lodging cancellation policies. While it granted refunds at the very start of the pandemic and then partially reimbursed hosts, since mid-March, the company has taken the stance that guests understand that travel may be disrupted by the pandemic, and has been using pre-pandemic rules that allow hosts to choose from one of three standard cancellation policies. Payment pages include information about the cancellation rules. Airbnb does have an ''Extenuating Circumstances policy'' but explicitly states it does not apply to reservations made after March 14 for Covid-related circumstances other than actual sickness. Individual hosts may agree to full or partial refunds.
  Vrbo, a vacation rental company owned by Expedia, follows policies similar to Airbnb. Its coronavirus resources page advises travelers to ''Review the property's cancellation policies. They apply even if your reservation is affected by COVID-19.'' In the same vein, VRBO's ''Book With Confidence Guarantee'' explanation on its website specifies that the guarantee was designed to protect guests ''from fraudulent listings and property misrepresentation. It does not cover cancellations due to unforeseeable circumstances, such as COVID-19.'' Customers who purchased travel insurance may be able to request a voucher for future dates.
  In essence, travelers could bear 100 percent of the financial impact of any local shutdown when booking with the companies.
  Vrbo said in an email that it does not plan on changing its policies and that ''travelers should work directly with the host on an alternative that works for both parties, such as rebooking the trip or a travel credit that can be used at a later date.'' Hosts are not required to offer those alternatives.
  Airbnb said in an email that ''Our extenuating circumstances policy is intended to protect guests and hosts from unforeseen circumstances that arise after booking,'' and that after the declaration of a global pandemic in March, ''Covid-19 and its consequences were no longer unexpected, including the risk of continued or new travel and movement restrictions.'' It noted that hosts choose a level of flexibility when they offer their homes for rent and that renters are informed of the policy when they make a reservation.
  Those policies aren't sitting well with guests like A.J. Sheffield, a software engineer in Silicon Valley, who booked an Airbnb in Southern California with his girlfriend and children for December. When the Stay At Home order was declared and he requested a refund from Airbnb, the company cited its rule and the refund was denied. ''I understand they created the policy based on previous lockdowns, but this is more severe,'' said Mr. Sheffield, referring to the fact that Airbnb home rentals were able to stay open in earlier shutdowns. Under current rules, hosts are breaking the law by continuing to rent for nonessential travel.
  ''Should we just take the hit with every new situation?'' he asked. ''Should we just never book with them again until we can be assured the government won't surprise us with any new restrictions?''
  The major hotel chains, in contrast, have tried to accommodate guests financially as the pandemic has unfolded. Hyatt hotels in California are proactively notifying guests of the new California travel restrictions before they arrive, according to the company. The more flexible cancellation policy the company put in place at the beginning of the pandemic remains in place. Hilton hotels will notify affected guests by email and cancel reservations from out-of-state guests with full refunds, according to the company. Marriott recently extended its cancellation policy through the end of March 2021. IHG continues to extend the dates for guests who had non-refundable pre-paid bookings to be able to cancel without penalty.
  Some smaller hotels are also trying to accommodate travelers' changing plans. Patty Baird owns the Cedar House Sport Hotel in Truckee, near two major ski resorts and in an area which is now limited to essential travelers. Predicting there would be travel disruptions, Ms. Baird has been taking reservations without requiring deposits since the late spring, so there is no negative financial impact to guests who cancel or reschedule. Much of her clientele returns year after year, she said. ''We would never charge them if they couldn't come,'' she said. Those who do come are asked to sign a statement saying they are there for essential travel.
  Ms. Baird is reaching out to people with reservations, but some are trying to game the system, she said. ''If you are an essential worker taking a few days' vacation, that is not considered essential travel,'' she said. As a small hotel owner, she said she wishes the government would supply some financial assistance to make up for the closures which run through at least the end of the year. ''This is our busiest time of year,'' she said.
  Travelers are getting the message to stop coming, though. California hotels and vacation rentals had 47 percent fewer reservations made in the first week of December in 2020 compared to the same week in 2019, according to Transparent, a firm which analyzes vacation rental information for 35 million listings worldwide.

2020/12/21,Why Can't Travelers in California Get Refunds on Short Rentals?,Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 3,"The state's latest travel restrictions make most hotel or short term lodging illegal. But Airbnb and Vrbo, the biggest home-sharing companies, are sticking to no-refund policies.
Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. For the latest updates, readThe New York Times's Covid-19 coverage here.
California's new travel restrictions, put in place to help prevent hospitals from being overwhelmed by the pandemic, have thrown vacation planning into reverse as travelers start canceling their lodging reservations. From now until at least Dec. 31, it is illegal for all hotel and short-term rental lodging owners in California to make or honor reservations for people coming from out of state unless they plan to quarantine in place for 14 days or are coming for essential purposes like health care, or infrastructure work. In much of the state, restrictions are even tighter, with only essential travel allowed.
There's a big split when it comes to cancellation and refund policies, though. Hotel chains by and large are accommodating travelers with full refunds. Many small hotels are doing the same. But some large home-sharing companies, like Airbnb and Vrbo, are telling guests that there is no guarantee they'll get their money back.

Every aspect of the travel industry has taken a significant hit during the pandemic, but home-sharing companies have had an advantage over hotels â?they are perceived as safer. It's easier to practice social distancing when you have your own entrance and kitchen, and are away from other guests. Short-term rentals have been regarded as a pandemic getaway for those who are working or learning remotely and can still afford a trip.
Airbnb, whose recent I.P.O. garnered the co-founder and chief executive, Brian Chesky,around $11 billion based on the company's overall valuation, has one of the strictest lodging cancellation policies. While it granted refunds at the very start of the pandemic and then partially reimbursed hosts, since mid-March, the company has taken the stance that guests understand that travel may be disrupted by the pandemic, and has been using pre-pandemic rules that allow hosts to choose from one of three standard cancellation policies. Payment pages include information about the cancellation rules. Airbnb does have an âExtenuating Circumstances policyâ?but explicitly states it does not apply to reservations made after March 14 for Covid-related circumstances other than actual sickness. Individual hosts may agree to full or partial refunds.
Vrbo, a vacation rental company owned by Expedia, follows policies similar to Airbnb. Its coronavirus resources page advises travelers to âReview the property's cancellation policies. They apply even if your reservation is affected by COVID-19.â?In the same vein, VRBO's âBook With Confidence Guaranteeâ?explanation on its website specifies that the guarantee was designed to protect guests âfrom fraudulent listings and property misrepresentation. It does not cover cancellations due to unforeseeable circumstances, such as COVID-19.â?Customers who purchased travel insurance may be able to request a voucher for future dates.
In essence, travelers could bear 100 percent of the financial impact of any local shutdown when booking with the companies.

2020/12/15,California Is Banning Short-Term Rentals. Why Can't Travelers Get Refunds?,TRAVEL,"The Times found a pattern of neglect and secrecy that helped fuel outbreaks both inside and outside ICE detention facilities.
The United States currently has the largest immigration detention system in the world. On any given day, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, holds tens of thousands of people in about 200 facilities across the country. And throughout the pandemic, these facilities have become some of the most dangerous places in the United States when it comes to Covid-19 outbreaks. 
  Our analysis compared estimated infection rates in ICE detention centers with infection rates in prisons and in the general population. As Covid-19 cases rose last June, ICE detention facilities had an average infection rate five times that of prisons and 20 times that of the general population.
  To understand the risks the ICE facilities posed, we talked to former detainees, data scientists, lawyers, county officials and the family of a former ICE contractor about the spread of Covid-19 inside and outside ICE detention centers. We also reviewed court documents, medical records of detainees and government inspection reports from June 2020 to March 2021. Here's what we found.
  1. Detainees have little protection from Covid-19 in custody.
  There are a number of reasons Covid-19 hit ICE detention sites particularly hard, including spotty implementation of the agency's own pandemic guidelines in its facilities.
  At the La Palma Correctional Center in Arizona for example, a recent government inspection report found repeated violations of mask-wearing and social-distancing protocols. According to the report, detainees staged peaceful protests to draw attention to these conditions, and were violently punished by detention center staff.
  Another problem is the lack of testing. At a Senate hearing last June, Henry Lucero, ICE's executive associate director of Enforcement and Removal Operations, testified that anyone experiencing Covid-19 symptoms in custody would be tested for the coronavirus.
  But that wasn't always true. Sandra Esqueda, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, was detained at the El Paso Service Processing Center in Texas from April to November 2020. Her medical documents show that after going to the facility's medical care unit with symptoms, she wasn't tested until five days later. She tested positive, and dozens of other detainees were infected around the same time, according to Ms. Esqueda.
  At another detention center in Farmville, Va., ICE's failure to contain the virus last summer led to an outbreak of about 250 cases, out of roughly 300 detainees in the facility. One later died of Covid-19.
  2. Infections inside detention centers have ripple effects in surrounding communities.
  Not all ICE facilities have been hit equally hard by Covid-19. A New York Times database analyzing reports from federal and local agencies found that larger outbreaks in ICE detention have tended to be concentrated in southern-border states.
  Take Frio County, Texas, for example. This rural county of around 20,000 people is home to two large ICE facilities run by private prison companies. On May 5, 2020, there were 10 known cases in the county, all of them linked to the South Texas ICE Processing Center. Three days later, the number of positive cases had tripled countywide.
  That trend continued for several more months, according to data analysts. Early findings from the UCLA Law Covid-19 Behind Bars Data Project show that throughout the pandemic, infections inside the detention facility in Frio County have typically been followed by infections in the general community.
  Researchers found the same pattern at nine other ICE facilities that experienced large outbreaks -- in Texas, Florida, Georgia, Arizona, Louisiana and California.
  In Laredo, Texas, local health authorities issued mandatory quarantine orders for two ICE detention centers in late July. Still, within the next few weeks, hundreds of new cases were reported at the detention centers, straining the city's already overwhelmed hospitals.
  A spokeswoman for ICE told The Times in a statement that the agency had ''taken extensive steps to safeguard all detainees, staff and contractors, including: testing upon intake, reducing the number of detainees in custody, placing individuals on alternatives to detention programs.''
  3. Lack of consistent Covid-19 data from ICE makes it difficult to track community spread.
  Every day, ICE posts the numbers of active infections among detainees, as well as deaths from Covid-19. But they don't maintain a running record of daily infections since the start of the pandemic, making it difficult to understand the extent to which the virus has spread in ICE detention over time.
  Another major limitation is that the agency does not release data on infections of staff members, information that is vital to understanding community spread. Experts say that staff movement is a major source of transmission of the virus from ICE detention centers to the general population. The data is also obscured by the fact that a vast majority of ICE detainees are held in facilities run not by the agency but by private prison companies, which are not required to share information with the public.
  At a House hearing on oversight of ICE detention facilities in July 2020, Representative Kathleen Rice of New York asked the chief executives of four ICE private contractors to release data on employee infections. All four said they would release the information with authorization from ICE, but to date there is still no systemwide data on infections among ICE contractors. In a statement to The Times, the agency declined to comment on how the pandemic has affected its staff.
  4. ICE could be releasing more people to reduce the spread of Covid-19.
  As an agency, ICE has wide discretion over who gets detained and released. Immigration detention is civil detention, meaning that people in custody are not there to serve time for committing a crime, but to wait for an immigration court to decide whether they can stay in the United States.
  In April 2020, a federal judge in California ordered ICE to ''identify and consider releasing detainees who are at higher risk of complications from Covid-19,'' regardless of legal status. Nearly a year later, the same judge found that the agency had ''failed to substantially comply with the court's orders.''
  In the past year, more than 3,700 people have been released from ICE detention, and the total number of people in ICE custody has been cut in half due to court orders and the Trump administration's coronavirus border restrictions.
  But the current average infection rate inside ICE detention facilities is still about 20 times that of the general U.S. population, according to the UCLA Law Covid-19 Behind Bars Data Project. This means ICE detention facilities are still hot spots of infection that pose risks to anyone who comes into contact with them. And unlike the Federal Bureau of Prisons, ICE does not have its own systemwide plan to vaccinate people in custody. Instead, it is leaving Covid-19 vaccinations for ICE detainees in the hands of state governments, to be administered at their own discretion.

2021/5/8,Pattern of Neglect and Secrecy by ICE Helped Fuel Outbreaks,Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 8,"Friday: California is heading into a difficult season. Also: How the pandemic is accelerating the growth of logistics in the Inland Empire.
Good morning.
(This article is part of the California Today newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox.)
First, an update on the pandemic and its potential collision with another looming threat: wildfire season.
Gov. Gavin Newsom, standing before a Black Hawk helicopter, said on Thursday that rising temperatures and browning grass were reminders that the pandemic is not the only threat Californians face.
âWe are now walking right into the thick of wildfire season,â?he said. âLet us take heed.â?[Read more on why California has so many wildfires.]
For Californians, the pandemic compounds an already precarious summer.
And in the summer, the wrong winds could blow any small grass fire out of control. Last year, the state's largest utility, Pacific Gas &amp; Electric Co., cut power to millions of Californians, hoping to prevent its equipment â?which has been blamed for some of the state's most disastrous blazes â?from sparking another conflagration.
This year, Mr. Newsom said on Thursday, the utility is out of bankruptcy and operating under stricter requirements to maintain its equipment and make improvements to its systems.
Still, the ability to keep Californians safe has been eroded from several angles. The state's budget has been hit hard in the pandemic-driven economic crisis, so while there was supposed to be funding to hire 500 new firefighters, there was instead funding for 172.
[See The Times's map tracking cases in California.]
Covid-19 outbreaks at state prisons have depleted inmate firefighting crews to 94 from 192, Mr. Newsom said, although to make up the deficit the state is hiring an additional 858 seasonal firefighters.
The normal ways of sheltering people forced to flee their homes had to be updated to accommodate social-distancing requirements and to eliminate buffet meals.
The state's director of emergency services, Mark Ghilarducci, said during the briefing that families fleeing fires may be moved into hotels. Individual meals will be packed.
Where residents must be in shelters, they'll be required to wear masks and have their temperature taken.
California reported an average of 8,077 new cases a day for the past week, as of Wednesday, according to The Times's database.
[If you missed it, read more about Pacific Gas &amp; Electric's emergence from bankruptcy.]
Now, here's a look at how the pandemic is accelerating major changes in the Inland Empire:
If you've been following the way the pandemic has been playing out in California, you already know that nothing about it has been equal.
Even as hospitalizations statewide have soared, hospitals are not becoming dangerously full everywhere. Latino and Black Californians are disproportionately likely to get sick. Even though millions of people have become unemployed, the worst of the economic crisis is hitting people who were already struggling to stay afloat.
In other words, the pandemic is widening existing divides.
This week, I wrote about how this is playing out in the Inland Empire, where huge warehouses for companies like Amazon and Walmart are transforming what used to be a sprawl of ranches and inexpensive houses.
[Read the full article here.]
There were some factories, but the physical scale of the logistics industry, which has allowed e-commerce giants and other big retailers to get things you order to your door faster than ever, is new.
When I first started reporting this story, that was a big part of what I hoped to show: that mind-bending scale. (You can see it in the article, in photos like the one above, and in satellite images showing the growth of such facilities over time.)
This kind of development, plus all the truck traffic, has clear negative environmental impacts, which â?like Covid-19 itself â?disproportionately hurts Latino and Black Californians.
The state recently took one step to mitigate that, adopting a rule requiring more than half of the trucks in California to be zero emissions by 2035.
But the fact is the demand for these warehouses isn't going anywhere. And millions of Californians are now out of work.
You can read more about the complicated bind workers are in, but for now, I'll leave you with one small point of cautious optimism for some experts, like Dr. Kirsten Bibbins-Domingo, the vice dean for population health and health equity at the School of Medicine at U.C. San Francisco.
She told me she was hopeful the pandemic could be a âwatershedâ?in getting people to recognize that all Californians' health depends on the health of essential workers â?especially the ones packing and shipping your stuff.

2020/7/10,Bracing for California Wildfires During a Pandemic California Today,US,"Stocks closed broadly lower on Wall Street on Monday, adding to their hefty losses from last week when the Federal Reserve pledged to keep interest rates high as long as it takes to tame inflation.
The S&P 500 fell 0.7 percent after wavering between small gains and losses. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 0.6 percent, and the Nasdaq composite lost 1 percent. Smaller company stocks also fell, pulling the Russell 2000 0.8 percent lower. 
  The selling was widespread, with technology and health care stocks among the biggest weights on the market. Only energy and utilities stocks rose.
  The market is coming off its worst weekly pullback since mid-June after the Fed chair, Jerome Powell, indicated on Friday that the central bank would raise rates into next year and keep them elevated as it tried to quell demand and bring down prices for goods and services.
  The Fed's seemingly open-ended commitment to raising rates has, for now, quieted speculation on Wall Street that the central bank would act less aggressively because of recent data showing more moderate inflation.
  ''We're in this period where you're going to see volatility be more of the norm versus the exception and will probably continue until, frankly, inflation gets under control and that then sets the motion for the Fed to become a little bit more dovish,'' said Terry Sandven, chief equity strategist at U.S. Bank Wealth Management.
  The Fed's last two increases have been by 0.75 points, and Wall Street was expecting a third such increase in September, according to CME Group. Some investors had hoped that the Fed would ease up on rate increases into next year if inflation subsided. That sentiment led to a rally for stocks in July and early August. All three major indexes are now lower this month.
  On Monday, the S&P 500 fell 27.05 points to 4,030.61. The index fell 3.4 percent on Friday, its biggest single-day drop since mid-June.
  The Dow dropped 184.41 points to 32,098.99, while the Nasdaq slid 124.04 points to 12,017.67. The Russell 2000 gave up 16.89 points to 1,882.94.
  Technology stocks, among the biggest decliners so far this year, led the downturn. Apple fell 1.4 percent.
  Health care stocks also lost ground. Catalent, a drug delivery technology company, slumped 7.4 percent for the biggest drop in the S&P 500 after giving investors a disappointing revenue forecast.
  Energy stocks made gains as U.S. crude oil prices rose 4.2 percent. Exxon Mobil rose 2.3 percent.
  The yield on the 10-year Treasury, which follows expectations for longer-term economic growth and inflation, rose to 3.11 percent from 3.03 percent late Friday. The yield on the two-year Treasury, which tends to track expectations for Fed action, rose to 3.43 percent from 3.38 percent.
  Investors have been closely watching economic reports to get a better sense of how much the economy is slowing and whether inflation is starting to cool from the hottest levels in four decades.
  The Fed's preferred gauge of inflation decelerated last month, while other data showed that consumer spending had slowed. Wall Street will get several more updates on the economy this week.
  The Conference Board will release its latest reading on consumer confidence on Tuesday.
  The government will release its closely watched monthly jobs report on Friday. The employment market has remained resilient amid a broader slowdown for the economy. That has helped temper worries that the United States is facing a potential recession.
  European markets also closed lower, and Asian markets closed lower overnight. Economic data from China showing a drop in industrial profits indicated that a strong recovery there would take time, amid fresh Covid-19 restrictions.

The United States currently has the largest immigration detention system in the world. On any given day, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, or ICE, holds tens of thousands of people in about 200 facilities across the country. And throughout the pandemic, these facilities have become some of the most dangerous places in the United States when it comes to Covid-19 outbreaks.
Our analysis compared estimated infection rates in ICE detention centers with infection rates in prisons and in the general population. As Covid-19 cases rose last June, ICE detention facilities had an average infection rate five times that of prisons and 20 times that of the general population.
To understand the risks the ICE facilities posed, we talked to former detainees, data scientists, lawyers, county officials and the family of a former ICE contractor about the spread of Covid-19 inside and outside ICE detention centers. We also reviewed court documents, medical records of detainees and government inspection reports from June 2020 to March 2021. Here's what we found.
1. Detainees have little protection from Covid-19 in custody.
There are a number of reasons Covid-19 hit ICE detention sites particularly hard, including spotty implementation of the agency's own pandemic guidelines in its facilities.
At the La Palma Correctional Center in Arizona for example, a recent government inspection report found repeated violations of mask-wearing and social-distancing protocols. According to the report, detainees staged peaceful protests to draw attention to these conditions, and were violently punished by detention center staff.
Another problem is the lack of testing. At a Senate hearing last June, Henry Lucero, ICE's executive associate director of Enforcement and Removal Operations, testified that anyone experiencing Covid-19 symptoms in custody would be tested for the coronavirus.
But that wasn't always true. Sandra Esqueda, an undocumented immigrant from Mexico, was detained at the El Paso Service Processing Center in Texas from April to November 2020. Her medical documents show that after going to the facility's medical care unit with symptoms, she wasn't tested until five days later. She tested positive, and dozens of other detainees were infected around the same time, according to Ms. Esqueda.
At another detention center in Farmville, Va., ICE's failure to contain the virus last summer led to an outbreak of about 250 cases, out of roughly 300 detainees in the facility. One later died of Covid-19.
2. Infections inside detention centers have ripple effects in surrounding communities.
Not all ICE facilities have been hit equally hard by Covid-19. A New York Times database analyzing reports from federal and local agencies found that larger outbreaks in ICE detention have tended to be concentrated in southern-border states.
Take Frio County, Texas, for example. This rural county of around 20,000 people is home to two large ICE facilities run by private prison companies. On May 5, 2020, there were 10 known cases in the county, all of them linked to the South Texas ICE Processing Center. Three days later, the number of positive cases had tripled countywide.
That trend continued for several more months, according to data analysts. Early findings from the UCLA Law Covid-19 Behind Bars Data Project show that throughout the pandemic, infections inside the detention facility in Frio County have typically been followed by infections in the general community.
Researchers found the same pattern at nine other ICE facilities that experienced large outbreaks â?in Texas, Florida, Georgia, Arizona, Louisiana and California.
In Laredo, Texas, local health authorities issued mandatory quarantine orders for two ICE detention centers in late July. Still, within the next few weeks, hundreds of new cases were reported at the detention centers, straining the city's already overwhelmed hospitals.
A spokeswoman for ICE told The Times in a statement that the agency had âtaken extensive steps to safeguard all detainees, staff and contractors, including: testing upon intake, reducing the number of detainees in custody, placing individuals on alternatives to detention programs.â?3. Lack of consistent Covid-19 data from ICE makes it difficult to track community spread.
Every day, ICE posts the numbers of active infections among detainees, as well as deaths from Covid-19. But they don't maintain a running record of daily infections since the start of the pandemic, making it difficult to understand the extent to which the virus has spread in ICE detention over time.
Another major limitation is that the agency does not release data on infections of staff members, information that is vital to understanding community spread. Experts say that staff movement is a major source of transmission of the virus from ICE detention centers to the general population. The data is also obscured by the fact that a vast majority of ICE detainees are held in facilities run not by the agency but by private prison companies, which are not required to share information with the public.
At a House hearing on oversight of ICE detention facilities in July 2020, Representative Kathleen Rice of New York asked the chief executives of four ICE private contractors to release data on employee infections. All four said they would release the information with authorization from ICE, but to date there is still no systemwide data on infections among ICE contractors. In a statement to The Times, the agency declined to comment on how the pandemic has affected its staff.
4. ICE could be releasing more people to reduce the spread of Covid-19.
As an agency, ICE has wide discretion over who gets detained and released. Immigration detention is civil detention, meaning that people in custody are not there to serve time for committing a crime, but to wait for an immigration court to decide whether they can stay in the United States.
In April 2020, a federal judge in California ordered ICE to âidentify and consider releasing detainees who are at higher risk of complications from Covid-19,â?regardless of legal status. Nearly a year later, the same judge found that the agency had âfailed to substantially comply with the court's orders.â?In the past year, more than 3,700 people have been released from ICE detention, and the total number of people in ICE custody has been cut in half due to court orders and the Trump administration's coronavirus border restrictions.
But the current average infection rate inside ICE detention facilities is still about 20 times that of the general U.S. population, according to the UCLA Law Covid-19 Behind Bars Data Project. This means ICE detention facilities are still hot spots of infection that pose risks to anyone who comes into contact with them. And unlike the Federal Bureau of Prisons, ICE does not have its own systemwide plan to vaccinate people in custody. Instead, it is leaving Covid-19 vaccinations for ICE detainees in the hands of state governments, to be administered at their own discretion.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (93%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (93%); POLITICAL DETAINEES (91%); CORRECTIONS (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); IMMIGRANT DETENTION CENTERS (90%); IMMIGRATION (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); NEGATIVE PERSONAL NEWS (90%); PANDEMICS (90%); PRISONS (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); COUNTIES (89%); ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS (79%); BORDER CONTROL (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (78%); COUNTY GOVERNMENT (78%); NEGATIVE MISC NEWS (78%); PUBLIC OFFICIALS (78%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (78%); VIRUSES (78%); TRENDS & EVENTS (77%); MEDICAL RECORDS (67%); PROTESTS & DEMONSTRATIONS (66%); RURAL COMMUNITIES (60%); Immigration Detention (%); Coronavirus Risks and Safety Concerns (%); Coronavirus (2019-nCoV) (%); Immigration and Customs Enforcement (US) (%); United States Politics and Government (%); Frio County (Tex) (%); Laredo (Tex) (%); United States (%); Disease Rates (%)

2021/4/25,4 Takeaways From Our Investigation Into ICE 's Mishandling of Covid-19,VIDEO,"The president falsely described scientific research around the malaria drug, falsely denied the existence of a federal warning against it and argued, with no evidence, that large numbers of health care workers were taking it.
As President Trump has promoted hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the coronavirus and claimed to be taking it himself, he has continued to make inaccurate or incomplete statements about the drug. Here is a fact check of his recent claims.
âYou'd be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the front-line workers before you catch it. The front-line workers, many, many are taking it.â?â?at a round table with restaurant executives on Monday
âHydroxychloroquine is used by thousands and thousands of front-line workers, so that hopefully they don't catch this horrible disease or whatever you want to call it.â?â?in a cabinet meeting on Tuesday
This lacks evidence. It is certainly possible that some doctors and health care workers are still taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive treatment, but there is little support for the president's repeated suggestion that the practice is widespread.
The American Medical Association said in a statement that it âdoes not know of any tracking or surveys examining personal use of hydroxychloroquine among health care workers.â?The American Nurses Association was more emphatic, saying that it âhas not received reports from nurses or other front-line health care workers utilizing hydroxychloroquine as a preventative treatment for Covid-19. Furthermore, to date, research has not shown clear evidence that hydroxychloroquine has a preventative effect for Covid-19.â?In March, The New York Times and other news organizations reported that some doctors were prescribing themselves and their family members hydroxychloroquine and hoarding supplies, according to pharmacy boards across the country.
That behavior, however, appears to have declined after a warning from the Food and Drug Administration that the drug could cause serious heart problems for coronavirus patients, studies questioning its efficacy and a series of regulations from states and medical boards restricting its use.
âWe have not received from the state boards of pharmacy any new concerns regarding the continued stockpiling of hydroxychloroquine,â?said Al Carter, the executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy.
âOnce states began implementing emergency limitations and guidelines on the amount of hydroxychloroquine that could be prescribed and dispensed for acute use, the complaints from pharmacists and state boards of pharmacy decreased significantly,â?Mr. Carter added.
Mr. Trump may have been referring to front-line workers who are participating in clinical trials on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in preventing Covid-19 infection. Thousands are currently enrolled in these trials, and many are still recruiting eligible volunteers. Participants in these trials, however, represent a tiny fraction of the health care and front-line workers across the country. There are over one million active doctors and nearly three million registered nurses alone.
Researchers conducting these trials also said that interest in taking the drug, even in a clinical setting, had waned recently.
One of the largest trials coordinated by Duke University School of Medicine and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, a nonprofit established by the Affordable Care Act that funds clinical research, has enrolled 550 health care workers, out of a goal of 15,000. Among a larger group of 12,000 front-line workers who have been sharing their experiences through the school's website, two-thirds were previously interested in participating in the hydroxychloroquine trial, but that is down to about half âsince the media hype,â?said Dr. Adrian Hernandez, who directs the Clinical Research Institute at Duke.
Another doctor conducting a clinical trial who spoke on the condition of anonymity said many colleagues had stashes of hydroxychloroquine in their offices and used it as a preventive measure in the early days of the pandemic. Use is continuing but is no longer as widespread, the doctor said, especially after the F.D.A. warning and as supplies of personal protective equipment became less scarce. The doctor's clinical trial, too, has lost recruitment because âpeople got scared,â?the doctor said.
Dr. H. Michael Belmont, a professor of medicine at New York University, said his study had recruited 125 participants out of a capacity of 350, partly because of strict eligibility requirements, partly because cases in New York had decreased and partly because studies showing the drug's ineffectiveness âreduced somewhat the enthusiasm.â?Taking hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic should really be done only in a research setting, Dr. Belmont emphasized. âYou do it outside a clinical trial, you lose the opportunity to answer scientific questions,â?he said.
âAnd if you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape. They were very old, almost dead. It was a 'Trump enemy' statement.â?â?in remarks to reporters on Tuesday
False. Mr. Trump was referring to a study of 368 Veterans Affairs patients â?all male with a median age over 65 â?hospitalized with Covid-19 infections. It found no evidence that hydroxychloroquine reduced patients' chances of being put on a mechanical ventilator and that the drug was associated with âincreased overall mortality.â?But he was wrong that it was the âonly bad surveyâ?that threw cold water on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.
When Mr. Trump dismissed the study of veterans this month, The Times noted that the current body of research was limited to a few studies criticized for methodological errors and was insufficient to support the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, another malaria drug, as treatments.
Since then, more research has been published. TwoÂ studies, each observing around 1,400 patients in New York City, concluded that administering hydroxychloroquine was not associated with greatly lower risk of mortality. Smaller studies in France and China reached similar conclusions.
Reporter: âThe F.D.A. has said hydroxychloroquine should not be used outside of a hospital setting or outside of a research study.â?Mr. Trump: âNo, that's not what I was told. No.â?â?in the cabinet meeting
False. The F.D.A.'s warning, issued in late April, specifically states that it âcautions against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for Covid-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems.â?The agency did authorize the use of the drugs âfor treatment of the virus in hospitalized patients when clinical trials are not available, or participation is not feasible.â?Mr. Trump seemed aware of the warning just an hour before he denied its existence.
âThe F.D.A. warned that hydroxychloroquine could cause serious side effects, especially with the heart, with your heart,â?a reporter told the president, after a luncheon with Republican senators.
âYeah. Yeah,â?he responded.

The New York Times reports that in the United States there have been more than 6.3 million Covid-19 cases and more than 190,000 deaths.
The two maps above use data as compiled by The Times as of Sept. 9, 2020. 
Definition: Per capita cases is the number of cases per person and is usually expressed as either 1 case in some number of people or as the number of cases per 100,000 people.

The Reveal
As of September 16, 2020, The New York Times reports that in the United States there have been more than 6.6 million Covid-19 cases and 196,058 deaths.
On March 28, 2020, The New York Times announced in the article âWe're Sharing Coronavirus Case Data for Every U.S. Countyâ?that they would be collaborating with states, counties, the Center for Disease Control and Prevention, Johns Hopkins University and other parties to assemble Covid-19 data. They have been tracking Covid-19 confirmed and probable cases by county, as well as other data both from the U.S. and from countries worldwide. The resulting U.S. statistics are published in the âCoronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Countâ?which is updated several times during the day. The maps released here are from September 9, 2020. Expect them to have changed when you link with the article.
These are just two maps showing just two different statistics â?total cases and total per capita cases. There are more maps, graphs and charts that show other statistics including number of tests, cases over the past seven days and deaths. But, we thought we would start here with statistics to compare U.S. counties' Covid-19 impact, one statistic (total number of cases) that does not take county population size into account and another statistic (per capita) that does take county population size into account. With the total cases map, we can compare, for example, Chicago, Illinois (in Cook County) with 135,690 cases to Brownsville, Texas (in Cameron County) with 21,222 cases. It seems like Chicago has been affected more than Brownsville. But, with the per capita map, we see Chicago has 1 case in 38 residents and Brownsville has 1 case in 19 residents. Here, the effect seems larger in Brownsville. Why do you think there is this difference?
From our live moderation, students submitted some terrific headlines that capture the map's stories including âIn the Red: A Look at How Covid-19 is Affecting Different US Statesâ?by Montessori Middle School in Shreveport, Louisiana, âWhat's the State of Coronavirus?â?by Natalie of San Francisco, âKeep your mask onâ?It's not over yet.â?by Jenna of Florida, and âThe Coasts Are Crawling with Covid-19 Casesâ?by Zuhayr of Eden Prairie, Minnesota.
You may want to think critically about these questions.
    â?Both maps use the same Covid-19 case data by county, but the maps show different statistics. The top bubble map shows the total number of cases since March. The bottom choropleth map shows the per capita number of cases since March expressed as 1 case per number of people in the county. (See the Stat Nugget below for an explanation of bubble map, choropleth map and per capita.)
Why do you think a bubble map was used for the total cases but a choropleth map for the per capita cases?
If the maps use the same data, why do they give a different impression of the impact of Covid-19 by county? What question does the top map best answer? What question does the bottom map best answer?
    â?There is another New York Times map that shows Covid-19 hot spots â?counties with a higher number of average daily new Covid-19 cases per 100,000 people in the past week. (To see this map, go to the article's first map and click on âHot spots.â? Compare this map to the per capita map (Click on âPer capita.â?
How do the location of the hot spots compare to the location of counties with the highest per capita cases? You can toggle between the two maps to see the difference. Note that the keys of the two maps are different in several ways.
    â?How is the county you live in fairing with Covid-19? You can find your state and county data and news summary at this URL: nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/YOUR-STATE-coronavirus-cases.html. (Type in the name of your state for YOUR-STATE. For states with two words in their name, put a hyphen between the words.) What do you notice and wonder? Here is a partial list of what is available on the states' websites:
    â?Table of state and county cases since March (total and per capita)
    â?Table of state and country cases in the last 7 days (total and per capita)
    â?Graph of state reported new cases and deaths by day since March
    â?About the collection of the state data
    â?According to The New York Times article âIs Your State Doing Enough Coronavirus Testing?â? âthe number of daily coronavirus tests being conducted in the United States is only 62 percent of the level considered necessary to mitigate the spread of the virus.â?The amount of testing and who takes these tests also affects the number of cases. You may want to read the article, which shows the amount of testing by state. What do you notice about the testing levels by state? How would increased testing affect the spread of Covid-19? How would it affect the maps?
Thank you for participating in âWhat's Going On in This Graph?â?which is intended to help you think more critically about graphs and the underlying data. Critical thinking is an essential element of statistics, the science of learning from data. Go to the American Statistical Association website to find more K â?12 statistics resources.

Stat Nuggets for âCoronavirus in the U.S.: Latest Map and Case Countâ?To see the archives of all Stat Nuggets with links to their graphs, go to this index.
BUBBLE MAP
Bubble maps are a variation of a scatter plot with data points replaced by bubbles. They display the values of three variables for each bubble. One variable is represented by the bubble's area. The other two variables are the longitude (x-axis) and latitude (y-axis) of the data point, showing each point's geographic location.
In the top Total Cases Covid-19 map, the three variables are the total number of Covid-19 cases by county and its approximate latitude and longitude coordinates. The area of the circles represents the total number of Covid-19 cases since March 2020. Examine the circle for Chicago (Cook County), with 135,690 cases, and the circle for Brownsville, Texas (Cameron County) in the southern tip of Texas, with 21,048 cases â?about one-sixth of the Chicago total cases. The area of the Chicago circle is about 6 times the area of the Brownsville circle.
CHOROPLETH MAP
A choropleth map is an easy way to visualize how a measurement varies over a geographic area. The map shows the values of a quantitative variable over established areas, such as counties or census tracts. The values are divided into ordered categories, each with a different color or pattern. With colors, they usually have a color scale that corresponds to the order categories of the values.
In the bottom Per Capita Covid-19 map, the map shows the values of a quantitative variable, which is the number of per capita cases of Covid-19 by county. The per capita values are expressed as 1 case per a specific number of people in the county. The ordered categories for the values represent the share of population with a reported case. They range from yellow (1 case in more than 200 people) to red (1 case in less than 30 people). Counties that are colored white have no cases reported. For example, locate Chicago, Illinois (Cook County) on the choropleth map. Note the county is shaded orange with 1 case in 38 people. Compare this to Brownsville, Texas (Cameron County) in the southernmost corner of Texas which is shaded red with 1 case in 19 people.
PER CAPITA
Per capita means âper headâ?in Latin. In mathematics, it means the average of some quantity for each person. Average assumes that the total amount is equally divided to each person. For example, if a $1 million prize were to be shared by all Americans (about 330,000,000 people), that would be approximately $0.003 per capita or about a third of a penny for each American. Since it is difficult to interpret small per capita numbers that are less than one, the per capita number is often multiplied by a larger number, such as 1,000 or 100,000. The $0.003 per person is the same as $3 per 1,000 people. While this is a very small prize, the amount is more understandable.
Another way to represent per capita is to express it as 1 in (or 1 out of) a specific number of people. In the $1 million prize example, this would be $1 in 333 people. (calculated by 1 is to x as $3 is to 1,000 people).
In the Per Capita Covid-19 map, the values for each county are expressed as 1 out of a calculated number of people. For example, in Chicago, Illinois (Cook County) with a population of about 5.2 million people, there are 135,690 cases. This is approximately 2,609 per 100,000 people (135,690 divided by 5,200,000 times 100,000) or 1 in 38 people (5,200,000 divided by 135,690).
Note that the greater per capita number of Covid-19 cases is expressed in a smaller number. For example, there is less Covid-19 impact in Cook County with 1 case in 41 people than in Brownsville, Texas, with 1 case in 20 people.

2020/9/10,What's Going On in This Graph? | Covid-19 Cases in America,LEARNING,"The BA.5 variant is going strong, but many New Yorkers no longer fear the coronavirus in the same way.
Good morning. It's Monday. Today, one topic: the state of the viruses â?Covid-19 and monkeypox.
New York City is living through a sixth wave of Covid-19 at the same time that a new virus, monkeypox, has appeared. Over the weekend, the World Health Organization declared monkeypox a âpublic health emergency of international concern.â?That is a designation the W.H.O. currently uses for only two other diseases, Covid-19 and polio.
As if Covid and monkeypox weren't enough, there has been an outbreak of polio in Rockland County, northwest of the city, with the health department there setting up pop-up polio vaccination clinics.
Against that backdrop, I asked Sharon Otterman, who covers health care and the pandemic for the Metro desk, to assess where things stand.
You wrote that New York is responding to the latest wave of Covid with that most New York of reactions â?a shrug. How troubling are the positive rates and transmission levels?
A lot of people are getting Covid as the BA.5 subvariant of Omicron moves through the city â?some for the first time, while others are being reinfected.
New York City's Covid-19 test positivity rate is just under 15 percent. Transmission levels of the virus, according to federal guidelines, are highin every borough, with about 4,200 infections being recorded each day. Even hospitalizations, while far below previous peaks, have risen.
On the other hand, most New Yorkers already have some immunity, whether from multiple vaccines or earlier bouts of the virus. This is helping to keep most of us out of the hospital, even though Covid can still be difficult and prolonged for some people.
For New York, this is a contrast, isn't it? For so much of the pandemic, so many New Yorkers were careful. They wore masks, got vaccinated and got boosted in greater numbers than people in many other places. What has changed?
To be sure, there are still some very cautious New Yorkers. Some people still wear masks in their offices, at Broadway shows, even on the street as they walk from place to place. This is sometimes to protect themselves and sometimes to protect others.
But for many New Yorkers, they just aren't as afraid of the virus as they once were. They are less willing to shape their lives around a virus that no longer feels deadly to them and that may just be part of everyone's lives for the long term.
The city has been distributing at-home tests as well as Paxlovid, the antiviral drug that protects against severe symptoms. How successful has the distribution been? Does the city have enough tests and enough Paxlovid to go around?
As of July 4, 82,700 courses of Paxlovid had been dispensed in New York City, according to the Department of Health, and there were tens of thousands of doses available. The city says there is enough Paxlovid for whoever qualifies.
While the city has not released a breakdown by race or neighborhood of who has gotten Paxlovid, equity has been a concern. As a result, the health department has deployed some âtest and treatâ?mobile units that can park in neighborhoods with less access to health care.
Still, it has been easier to get Paxlovid in New York City than many other places. People with Covid can call 212-COVID19 to be connected virtually with a provider to see if they qualify, or they can get a prescription from their doctors.
As for home tests, the city has millions of them. They are available at distribution points, such as libraries, and the city has moved to a testing strategy that emphasizes them.
The city did away with its color-coded alert system as cases were climbing into the red zone. What was the motivation for doing that?
Mayor Eric Adams had instituted the color-coded alert system early in his mayoralty, but as the months passed, it became clear that he didn't find it useful. As the alert levels moved from medium to high, he didn't follow its suggested recommendations, such as bringing back vaccination checks at restaurants. So when the alert system was going to move back into high, after a brief stop at medium between two Omicron waves earlier this summer, he decided to scrap it.
Officially, the city is reassessing it. It seems the city only wants a high alert to be triggered in case of a serious strain on the health care system.
Let's shift to the monkeypox outbreak. How serious is it?
As of Friday, 839 people had tested positive in New York City, a bit more than a quarter and bit less than a third of all cases nationally.
Nearly all the cases have been among men who have sex with men, and it appears the virus is mostly transmitting through close, intimate contact. The risk is particularly high if they have multiple sexual partners or are hooking up via apps or at raves. For this reason, the limited vaccine that is available is reserved for this community.
For people not in this community, the risk right now is judged to be low. That could change, however, if the virus continues to spread.
The messaging about monkeypox has divided the Health Department. Why?
Some epidemiologists think the city needs to be direct in advising gay and other men who have sex with men to limit or change their sexual behavior until this outbreak is brought under control.
But the department's leadership believes it is more effective to simply provide information about the virus to people, as well as a range of strategies that may make it less likely for them to get monkeypox.
This is a difficult debate. Some gay men say they are offended by the discussion. They say they are already changing their behavior and don't need the preaching, which could backfire. Beyond that, many who work in public health say an abstinence-focused message, even if is well-intentioned, could create more stigma around having monkeypox. And that, in turn, could keep some people from seeking help.
After a scorching weekend, it won't be quite so hot today. Expect temps in the high 80s and thunderstorms with gusty winds in midafternoon. The showers will continue into the evening, with temps dropping to the low 70s.
In effect until Aug. 15 (Feast of the Assumption).

The aloe plant
Dear Diary:
I was waiting for the bus in Park Slope, my hands in fists in the bottom of my torn red gloves. When I was 15, someone told me that your hands don't get as cold if your fingers are together, connected, and I've always remembered that.
There were two aloe plants on the silver bus stop seats, one at each end, with the middle seat empty. A middle-age man in a large blue coat wandered by and took a picture of the plants.
I started to get sad about my relationship having ended before the holidays. The wind bit my cheeks.
A woman came out of the realty office behind me. She smiled.
âWould you like aloe plant?â?she said.
âI thought those were there for decoration,â?I said.
âPlease take,â?she said. âI have plant inside that has grown too big for pot. I can't keep all.â?She went inside and showed me the plant through the window. It looked like a giant green octopus. She came back out with some cuttings.
âTake one, take two,â?she said. âJust put in soil.â?âOK, sure,â?I replied. âThanks!â?I held the bumpy creatures in my hands as the bus pulled up. After getting off, I walked toward my house, a cutting in each hand.
A man passed me.
âThat looks good!â?he said.
I whirled around.
âDo you want one?â?I asked.
âOh no, I couldn't,â?he said.
âNo, please, someone was just giving these away on the street.â?âWow, yes,â?he said. âI'd love one. My mother-in-law just gave me a pot and I wanted to get a succulent.â?I walked to my house, one hand holding my remaining cutting and the fingers of my free hand wrapped around each other into a ball. That hand was much warmer.

2022/7/25,Covid and Monkeypox: Where New York City Stands New York Today,NYREGION,"When someone in the family tests positive for the coronavirus, there are some guidelines to follow.
Though I have been writing about Covid-19 for The New York Times for the past two years, I still felt overwhelmed when my son was sent home from school sick in mid-March and tested positive. Suddenly, I was in a cluttered New York City apartment with my husband, first grader and third grader, a lot of virus particles and no clear plan. 
  We did try to isolate positive from negative family members at first and wear masks, but we all got sick anyway. The rolling series of infections lasted for about three weeks, and my symptoms included a 102-degree fever, sore throat and congestion. We were all fully vaccinated, and my husband and I were boosted.
  Could we have done a better job at limiting the virus's impact on our household?
  To answer this, I reached out to seven experts for practical tips for families with young children who test positive for Covid, as the highly transmissible Omicron subvariant BA.2 is circulating.
  Here are answers to some of the questions that I grappled with.
  Should we swab our noses and throats?
  Early detection is vital to slow down transmission, and in Canada and Britain many authorities recommend swabbing the throat, then nostrils to find the virus sooner.  ''A good five seconds on each spot, and each side, is best,'' said Dr. Kashif Pirzada, an attending emergency physician in Toronto. ''There's some good research showing an improvement with the combined approach in the sensitivity of these tests.''
  In the United States, however, there was disagreement. Several experts I spoke with recommended against using nasal rapid tests to swab the throat, largely because the Food and Drug Administration hasn't authorized it. ''We have seen false positives from throat swabs based on the acidity of recent food and beverage consumed,'' said Dr. Eric Ascher, a family medicine doctor affiliated with Lenox Hill Hospital. Others backed trying the method. 
  Is a rapid test enough?
  If family members test positive on a rapid test, it is safe to assume they have Covid, and they should begin isolating and taking precautions, the experts agreed. If they test negative, they should retest frequently while exposed, if possible, and assume they are positive if symptoms begin.
  ''It is important to know that some people do not test positive during the first one to three days of infection,'' said Dr. Michael Mina, an authority on Covid-19 testing and the chief science officer for Emed.
  The experts disagreed about whether it was necessary to also get a P.C.R. test to confirm rapid test results; several said that rapid tests were sufficient. Dr. Pirzada said that confirming results with a P.C.R. is advisable when the first family member gets a positive rapid test or shows symptoms but is not necessary after that. Dr. Kevin Slavin, the head of pediatric infectious diseases at Joseph M. Sanzari Children's Hospital said that he prefers the whole family to get the more sensitive P.C.R. test. The bottom line, though, is that people should not wait for positive P.C.R. results to begin isolating and taking precautions.
  Each person who becomes symptomatic or tests positive should begin isolating for at least five days, and longer if they are still feverish or not improving. (Pro tip: Day 1 is the day after taking the test that turned positive or developing symptoms, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rules).
  In our case, after my son tested positive on a P.C.R., the rest of us did only home tests. We also used rapid tests again to determine when we were no longer contagious -- which many, but not all, experts agree is a best practice to keep others safe. Most people test negative by Day 10, but that time period could range from five to 14 days, meaning a person could be contagious for all that time.
  ''The assumption is that if you don't have enough virus in your nose to trigger a positive result, that you're probably not very contagious. But these things are on a continuum,'' said Dr. Gigi Gronvall, who runs the COVID-19 Testing Toolkit project at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
  P.C.R. tests are also helpful in other ways, such as to document disability if you get long Covid. But the downside is, you generally have to leave the house to get them. 
  Should I wear a mask in public if anyone in the house is sick?
  Yes. No matter what, once someone in the household has Covid, everyone -- even the vaccinated who are still negative or asymptomatic -- should wear a well-fitting, high-quality mask for 10 days in public in indoor or crowded outdoor situations.
  Family members who have recently been exposed to Covid and are still testing negative should avoid seeing high-risk people. They should also take precautions while traveling, according to the C.D.C.
  Deciding whether to send well children to school if a household member has Covid is more complex. Unvaccinated children should, according to the C.D.C., stay home for at least five days and then take a virus test. Most districts permit fully vaccinated children to attend school unless they are symptomatic or test positive, but they should wear high-quality masks and get tested at least on the fifth day after exposure, preferably every morning before school, Dr. Mina said.
  If a vaccinated child is highly exposed to Covid at home but is still healthy, parents might consider keeping that child home to protect others. Masks do come off at lunch. But this measure would be going above and beyond the federal recommendations, and only one expert I spoke with recommended it.
  Should I try to reduce exposure in the household, even if it seems futile?
  As parents know, the term ''close contact'' takes on a whole new meaning with young children, who seem to have an uncanny ability to sneeze in your face. Even so, the experts agreed that reducing exposure to each others' illnesses is still worth the effort.
  There is a small window of time when this is particularly important -- between exposure and when the immune system begins to fully engage. 
  Parents have to care for children, and some siblings simply can't be kept apart. Still, there are steps you can take. Whoever gets sick first should be in his or her own room, if possible. Put a HEPA filter in there, if you have one. Try to get the sick person to stay in there for meals. Wear high-quality masks when family members are together.
  Open the windows. Place another HEPA filter, if you have two, where other family members are spending time. Another pro-tip: Keep the air at 40 to 60 percent humidity, which helps stop aerosol transmission, Dr. Pirzada said, by using a hygrometer or a humidifier to measure the level.
  Use common sense. Once the air filters are running, the windows are cracked and masks are worn when possible; attempting more may feel like too much if a young child is ill. ''If my kid were sick, my natural instinct would be to care for them,'' said Dr. Linsey Marr, a leading expert on viral transmission. ''I could see throwing my hands up, relying on the vaccine and my good health to keep me from falling seriously ill and cuddling with my kid.''
  The good news is that once you test positive, exposure to other family members who are also positive is unlikely to make you sicker, the experts agreed. And it isn't likely that the family members who recover first will be reinfected by those still sick.
  Five days after the last family member who had Covid tests negative, others in the household are almost certainly in the clear.
  How can I protect the most vulnerable?
  Covid can be spread before symptoms begin. Within a household, that may mean that everyone has already been exposed even before the first cough or positive test.
  Still, if there is a particularly vulnerable person in the household, like a grandparent, you should focus on keeping the family member safe, even out of the house once someone tests positive. (Keep in mind, though, that the family member may sicken others if already infected.) If the vulnerable person stays in the house, put a HEPA filter in the room if possible and keep the family member separated from others. Contact a doctor for possible treatment possibilities. And of course, wear high-quality masks when interacting and try to keep hands and surfaces clean.
  With Omicron being so contagious, the percentage of household members who get sick once Covid enters the house is higher than with earlier strains. But it is still not 100 percent (one C.D.C. study placed it at between 40 and 70 percent, depending on precautions taken). So stay optimistic! It is possible to remain uninfected.
  ''I got Covid-19 last year and have a new baby in the house,'' said Dr. Mina. ''Between constant wearing of N95s, using HEPA air filters in my home and keeping windows open, I'm the only one in the house that ever contracted Covid.''
  What do I need on hand?
  The experts had some suggestions for a plan to have in place for when someone gets sick:
  Have ready HEPA filters -- or a less expensive, D.I.Y. version you can build yourself, known as a Corsi-Rosenthal box. Decide which bedroom could be an isolation room.
  Have comfortable masks, preferably N95 or KF94 or KN95 masks, for the whole family to wear indoors until they recover.
  Stockpile a few other supplies. Some you might want to consider: a humidifier, a thermometer, Mucinex for adults, Tylenol or Advil, pulse oximeter, sanitizer, rapid tests, disinfecting wipes, electrolyte drinks like Gatorade and Vitamin D3 to boost immunity.
  Ensure family members are up-to-date with their vaccinations.
  Have your doctor's phone number and emergency contacts at hand. If you call right after someone tests positive, your doctor can advise if the family member qualifies for Paxlovid or other new treatments to aid in recovery. Doctors can also tell you when it's time to seek another level of care.
  If you don't have a doctor and live in New York City, call 212-COVID19. There are also now ''Test to Treat'' sites around the country.

    â?Get the latest updates here, as well as maps and vaccines in development.
Britain is set to start vaccinations
Leaping ahead of the U.S., Britain gave emergency authorization to Pfizer's coronavirus vaccine today, and the country is set to begin the first inoculations against Covid-19 on Monday morning.
With the move, Britain became the first Western country to allow mass vaccinations against the virus and the first country to authorize the use of a fully tested vaccine. (Russia and China have approved vaccines, but without waiting for the results from large-scale trials.)
The early approval is a shot in the arm for a country that has struggled to get the virus under control and where more than 59,000 people have died from Covid-19, according to a New York Times database.
The first Britons on the list to receive a vaccine are nursing home residents and workers, followed by people older than 80 and health and social care workers. In practice, though, frontline hospital workers may be quicker to receive vaccines because of the difficulties of storing and moving the Pfizer vaccine to nursing homes and other sites.
Britain beat the United States to authorization â?even though the vaccine was developed by an American pharmaceutical giant (and the small German company BioNTech) â?by taking a different, and quicker, route.
While American regulators work line by line through the raw data from vaccine makers to check their trial results, their counterparts in Britain rely more heavily on the companies' own analyses. Britain also relied on an old law that allowed the country to circumvent the European Union's regulatory regimen, and its regulatory agency fast-tracked the review of the Pfizer vaccine.
The speedy approval has fed concerns about safety, though British regulators have repeatedly said they have not taken shortcuts. Regulators there not only review trial data, but also the manufacturing processes of vaccines and controls.
In the U.S., the Food and Drug Administration will decide on emergency authorization for the Pfizer vaccine shortly after a meeting of an advisory panel on Dec. 10. The European Union, like the F.D.A., has planned a high-profile meeting with outside experts who will weigh in on the vaccine, on Dec. 29, and a decision on authorization is expected several days later.
When will kids get a vaccine?
When it comes to developing vaccines and tests, children are last in line.
In the medical field, they are considered a protected group, along with pregnant women, and often require special consideration before they are included in clinical trials. Denise Grady, who covers science for The Times, told me that this special status for minors can be a double-edged sword.
âYou protect them from possible harm,â?Denise said. âBut then if a vaccine or treatment is OK, they are the last to get it because you've delayed testing it in them.â?Two recent reports underscored how children should not be treated like miniature grown-ups when it comes to the coronavirus.
A growing body of evidence now suggests that some rapid tests for the coronavirus may fail in children, letting low-level infections slip by unnoticed. With some schools relying heavily on these tests to remain open safely, health experts say the findings should prompt more in-depth studies of diagnostic tools for the virus among minors.
When it comes to vaccines, none can be given to children until they have been tested in pediatric trials. The drug maker Moderna said today that it would soon begin testing its vaccine in children aged 12 to 17, and would like to recruit 3,000 volunteers. (Pfizer began testing its coronavirus vaccine in children as young as 12 in October.) Some experts have argued that the trials should have started earlier because Moderna's approach could delay the day when children can safely receive vaccinations.
âIt may seem like children are an afterthought in medical research,â?Denise said. âBut really, it's a tough balancing act between protecting them from potentially harmful experimentation and yet making new vaccines and treatments available to them as soon as it can be done safely.â?Resurgences

What you're doing
I'll be honest in that I cannot deal with a pandemic and social distancing. So I live mostly as if there is no pandemic, except that I always wear my mask and am mindful of when I am in places of essential business like grocery stores. Where I live the bars are still open late and I always go out to let out steam and socialize. They are getting more and more full over time as more people are becoming pandemic fatigued. I feel bad sometimes but also I have to survive. This is the most difficult situation I have ever faced, including my divorce in 2019.

For months, New York City's younger children have been waiting in the wings as adults and some teenagers got vaccinated against Covid-19. As of Thursday, 12- to 15-year-olds were next in line for their shots.
Young people across the country were offered the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine after an advisory committee to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention voted to recommend it for use in children ages 12 to 15 on Wednesday.
Mayor Bill de Blasio encouraged parents to get their children, members of Generation Z, vaccinated to protect their families.
âParents, let's get our 'Zoomers' off of Zoom and back to life as normal,â?the mayor said.
[Read more about the children nationwide â?from Seattle to New York City â?who got vaccinated Thursday.]
My colleague Joseph Goldstein spoke with young people in the city as they got their first doses. Here's what they had to say:
Julian Boyce, 14, was among the first to get vaccinated in Harlem on Thursday.
Julian's parents wasted no time in getting him vaccinated. They quickly brought him to Harlem Hospital Center, where his father is an administrator, for his first dose.
His family knew about 20 people who had died from Covid-19, including two people in their apartment building and church members.
Julian, an eighth grader, texted his friends: âI just got my vaccine.â?In Brooklyn, a seventh grader got a surprise vaccination.
Berrit Nordlander-Borowski had been looking forward to getting vaccinated, but said she didn't feel the need to get it immediately. Her mother, Betsy Nordlander, had other plans. She booked an appointment Wednesday night.
âI surprised her,â?Ms. Nordlander said. âShe woke up this morning to hear, 'Guess what?'â?Berrit said she's excited to hang out again with her friends, though she has enjoyed remote learning. Now, Berrit's sister, the 9\xC2-year-old Astrid, is the only unvaccinated family member.
âI feel kind of left out, but I know that soon enough I will probably be able to get the vaccine,â?Astrid said. âBut I wish I could have it now.â?Teenagers in the Bronx encouraged their friends to get vaccinated.
Zenaida Hill and her teenage daughters, Maya and Loida, said they have plenty of plans to look forward to after getting vaccinated, like a family reunion and spending more time outside. Maya, 15, was so eager that she booked the appointment herself.
After she got her shot, Maya messaged her friends encouraging them to get vaccinated. Loida, 13, said she was happy to be able to start the ninth grade in person this fall.
âI'll tell generations after me how we got through this,â?Loida said, âand that many people got the vaccine and we were able to overcome Covid-19.

Metropolitan Diary: What's the count? 
Dear Diary:
I was walking home through Central Park when I decided to stop and sit on a bench near the Balto statue and do some late-afternoon people watching.
I soon became aware of a loud voice coming from a grassy hill just over my shoulder. At first I thought it was someone making a speech, but I gradually realized it was someone announcing an imaginary baseball game.
I turned slightly and saw a young man pantomiming pitching from a mound. After each pitch, he announced the count. By now, the bases were loaded.
Strike 1.
Ball 1.
Ball 2.
Strike 2.
A small crowd had gathered, attracted by the young man's energetic performance.
Ball 3. The suspense was growing.
The pitcher wound up for the next critical pitch, released the make-believe ball and paused.
He stood for a moment before making the triumphant announcement: Strike 3. He had won the game.
The crowd burst into applause.

2021/5/14,First Shots for a Younger Set of New Yorkers New York Today,NYREGION,"Advice for gathering this winter.
There was a brief moment this fall, when Covid-19 cases were low and we hadn't yet heard the word ''tripledemic,'' that I thought we might have something close to a normal holiday season, for the first time in years. But the last few weeks have changed the picture. 
  A soup of Omicron variants is swirling across the U.S., and we don't yet know how much these variants will spread this winter. Meanwhile, a surge in flu and R.S.V. cases is already stretching hospitals thin, and we still have months of cold weather ahead.
  For advice on managing the holidays this year, I turned to my colleague Dani Blum, a reporter on the Well desk.
  How should we approach the holidays?
  This is our third pandemic holiday season, so a lot of us are really tired of taking precautions and the mental gymnastics they require.
  So my main advice this year is to make a plan. I know how uncomfortable it can be to call up your relatives and ask them, ''When are you testing?'' and ''How are you thinking about virus precautions this year?'' But thinking through some of these obstacles together and getting on the same page may alleviate a lot of anxiety and tension.
  The other major thing to keep in mind is to plan around the highest-risk person. The calculations are going to be different for a family with older relatives than for a Friendsgiving of twentysomethings where no one is immunocompromised. Another thing experts I spoke to advised was to do a mini-quarantine before the holidays.
  How does that work?
  A mini-quarantine means spending about a week minimizing your interactions with people before you gather. So maybe you have the ability to work from home instead of going into the office. Do that. Maybe that week you only meet friends outdoors, or go grocery shopping at the least crowded time, or order groceries to your house. It's also not the time to be going to a packed bar or restaurant. Depending on how high-risk the most vulnerable person in your group is, your weeklong mini-quarantine can be on a gradient.
  Why one week?
  It's not going to completely insulate you from risk, of course, but if you're watching for symptoms and testing responsibly, you'll have a pretty good idea during that week whether you have Covid. The experts I spoke to said it's about minimizing your risk, along with testing, to give yourself as much data as possible so you can make the best decisions.
  What else should we keep in mind?
  In terms of masking, I think it's not super realistic to ask people to mask for something like a Thanksgiving dinner. Where masking makes the most sense is during transportation to and from an event. If you are getting on a plane or a train, you want to make sure that you're wearing a mask for as long as possible, and not just any mask but a high-quality mask. The experts I spoke to had a lot of confidence in one-way masking. Even if you are the only person on a plane wearing a mask, it still provides decent protection.
  Also, this is a big one: If you feel sick -- as sad as it is -- you should stay home, even if that means skipping out on family gatherings over the holidays. You might have Covid, you might have the flu, or you might have R.S.V. You might be able to rule out Covid with a test, but it's harder with the other two. And an important thing to know about R.S.V. is that adults can get it, too. And while it might be mild for you, it can be very serious for older adults, younger children and people with weakened immune systems.
  What should I do if I get Covid?
  The C.D.C.'s current guidance is to stay at home at least five days and isolate from others as much as possible.
  I should also say that new Omicron variants are steadily gaining ground in the U.S., and it's not totally clear yet what's going to happen with them. Cases are currently ticking up, and there are other viruses circulating. We know that a lot of the precautions that we take for Covid will also help manage the flu and R.S.V., like washing our hands and masking. So, despite many places no longer requiring masks, and despite a lot of people -- myself included -- allowing more risk into our lives, there are still plenty of reasons to take Covid precautions around the holidays.
  How are you personally approaching the holidays?
  I'm going home, and I have a relatively large family. I'm doing a mini-quarantine one week before, and I'll be testing with both P.C.R. and rapid tests right up until the moment I see them. My life may look a little restrictive leading up to the holidays, but then during the holidays it will look like any other. I'll be able to act normally, share meals and hug my siblings. It should be really lovely -- it just requires some advance planning.

  Your approach to the holidays
  We asked readers how they are approaching the holiday season this year. Thanks to everyone who shared their plans.
  ''This year, I am approaching the holidays as I did in prepandemic years. Looking forward to baking, gift shopping and hosting and attending parties with family and friends. We will have a large group for Thanksgiving, and I am choosing not to mask or worry about the guests' vaccination status. I imagine one or two people I know will test positive sometime during the holidays, but it won't give me the same level of anxiety it did in years past. We suffered broken friendships, job changes, moved from our community and missed out on so much during the last two holiday seasons I am mentally not able to invest in so much stress and worry anymore.'' -- Alison, Arizona
  ''As an immune-compromised person, I do not have the luxury of 'returning to normal.' I plan to approach the holidays cautiously, with many of the recommended Covid protocols. I booked my flight at a less busy time so I can spend Christmas and Kwanzaa with family.'' -- Akay, Minnesota
  ''I have decided to go all in. I got the extra leaf for the dining room table down from the attic. I bought Thanksgiving napkins. I invited 10 of my closest relatives.'' -- Jean, Pittsboro, N.C.
  ''I am approaching the holidays almost the same as before the pandemic, with the following exceptions: I will not travel or interact if not feeling well. I will home-test if there are adults over the age of 65 attending any gathering. I will not attend any event in which a mask is required.'' -- Timothy Taylor, Longmeadow, Mass.
  ''This will be our third year of missing our family for the holidays. Our tradition of flying to Portland to gather with my children and grandchildren has been scuttled. We are in our 70s. The other side of the family does not believe in Covid. 'It is over,' they have said for a year, telling their 75-year-old heart patient father they 'will not test, vaccinate, distance or wear masks' and that 'they would love to see him, but if he wants to see them, it's his choice.' It has been heartbreaking.'' -- Ann Sasnett, California
  Your pandemic traditions
  We also asked readers if the pandemic brought on any positive changes that became holiday traditions. Thanks to everyone who wrote in.
  ''We began celebrating 'Chrisgiving' in 2020. This will be our third year having our family Thanksgiving and Christmas celebration the first weekend in December. Less air travelers, less exposure to the latest version of whatever disease and an entire long weekend of my children and their significant others to myself -- I don't have to share them with their in-laws!'' -- Michele Pugleasa, Minneapolis
  ''My family has finally started cutting out the unnecessary guests that no one really enjoys inviting each year. It sounds bad, but it really takes a weight off everyone's shoulders and lets us have a better time with just the people closest to us.'' -- Morgan, Wisconsin
  ''The pandemic helped me get into baking. Now during holidays I contribute by making baked goods for everyone in my family. It's become a tradition and something I will continue to do over the years.'' -- Kaylie Parker, California
  ''Christmas cards became more creative. I continue this tradition with my twist ... watercoloring. Pandemic quarantine made my hidden artist bloom.'' -- Maryellen McWhirter, San Diego
  ''When my family and I were in lockdown, we had a very small gathering for the holidays. We decided that it was better than having everyone together at the same time. We had more quality visits, and it was less stressful. We are resuming small gatherings this year. Rather than all getting together on one day, we have several smaller, more intimate gatherings throughout the holiday season.'' -- Christine Larkin, Bay Shore, N.Y.
  ''We have certainly become more appreciative of being able to be together, and we don't take it for granted. We stay home together more and play games and talk. We're not on our devices all the time. It reminds me of when I was a child and everyone gathered together and shared stories and went around the table and stated two things they were grateful for. When family is around, we do that now.'' -- Clare Leach, Puerto Vallarta, Mexico
  ''I lost my husband, Mike, who loved a big Christmas tree, to Covid in April 2020. We still try to honor the big tree and lights.'' -- Mary Mantell, New Jersey

  Guangzhou, the new epicenter of China's outbreak, is suffering from widespread lockdowns, The South China Morning Post reports.

2022/11/9,How to Approach the Holidays,BRIEFING,"The president falsely described scientific research around the malaria drug, falsely denied the existence of a federal warning against it and argued, with no evidence, that large numbers of health care workers were taking it.
As President Trump has promoted hydroxychloroquine as a treatment for the coronavirus and claimed to be taking it himself, he has continued to make inaccurate or incomplete statements about the drug. Here is a fact check of his recent claims. 
  ''You'd be surprised at how many people are taking it, especially the front-line workers before you catch it. The front-line workers, many, many are taking it.''-- at a round table with restaurant executives on Monday
  ''Hydroxychloroquine is used by thousands and thousands of front-line workers, so that hopefully they don't catch this horrible disease or whatever you want to call it.''-- in a cabinet meeting on Tuesday
  This lacks evidence. It is certainly possible that some doctors and health care workers are still taking hydroxychloroquine as a preventive treatment, but there is little support for the president's repeated suggestion that the practice is widespread.
  The American Medical Association said in a statement that it ''does not know of any tracking or surveys examining personal use of hydroxychloroquine among health care workers.''
  The American Nurses Association was more emphatic, saying that it ''has not received reports from nurses or other front-line health care workers utilizing hydroxychloroquine as a preventative treatment for Covid-19. Furthermore, to date, research has not shown clear evidence that hydroxychloroquine has a preventative effect for Covid-19.''
  In March, The New York Times and other news organizations reported that some doctors were prescribing themselves and their family members hydroxychloroquine and hoarding supplies, according to pharmacy boards across the country.
  That behavior, however, appears to have declined after a warning from the Food and Drug Administration that the drug could cause serious heart problems for coronavirus patients, studies questioning its efficacy and a series of regulations from states and medical boards restricting its use.
  ''We have not received from the state boards of pharmacy any new concerns regarding the continued stockpiling of hydroxychloroquine,'' said Al Carter, the executive director of the National Association of Boards of Pharmacy.
  ''Once states began implementing emergency limitations and guidelines on the amount of hydroxychloroquine that could be prescribed and dispensed for acute use, the complaints from pharmacists and state boards of pharmacy decreased significantly,'' Mr. Carter added.
  Mr. Trump may have been referring to front-line workers who are participating in clinical trials on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine in preventing Covid-19 infection. Thousands are currently enrolled in these trials, and many are still recruiting eligible volunteers. Participants in these trials, however, represent a tiny fraction of the health care and front-line workers across the country. There are over one million active doctors and nearly three million registered nurses alone.
  Researchers conducting these trials also said that interest in taking the drug, even in a clinical setting, had waned recently.
  One of the largest trials coordinated by Duke University School of Medicine and the Patient-Centered Outcomes Research Institute, a nonprofit established by the Affordable Care Act that funds clinical research, has enrolled 550 health care workers, out of a goal of 15,000. Among a larger group of 12,000 front-line workers who have been sharing their experiences through the school's website, two-thirds were previously interested in participating in the hydroxychloroquine trial, but that is down to about half ''since the media hype,'' said Dr. Adrian Hernandez, who directs the Clinical Research Institute at Duke.
  Another doctor conducting a clinical trial who spoke on the condition of anonymity said many colleagues had stashes of hydroxychloroquine in their offices and used it as a preventive measure in the early days of the pandemic. Use is continuing but is no longer as widespread, the doctor said, especially after the F.D.A. warning and as supplies of personal protective equipment became less scarce. The doctor's clinical trial, too, has lost recruitment because ''people got scared,'' the doctor said.
  Dr. H. Michael Belmont, a professor of medicine at New York University, said his study had recruited 125 participants out of a capacity of 350, partly because of strict eligibility requirements, partly because cases in New York had decreased and partly because studies showing the drug's ineffectiveness ''reduced somewhat the enthusiasm.''
  Taking hydroxychloroquine as a prophylactic should really be done only in a research setting, Dr. Belmont emphasized. ''You do it outside a clinical trial, you lose the opportunity to answer scientific questions,'' he said.
  ''And if you look at the one survey, the only bad survey, they were giving it to people that were in very bad shape. They were very old, almost dead. It was a 'Trump enemy' statement.''-- in remarks to reporters on Tuesday
  False. Mr. Trump was referring to a study of 368 Veterans Affairs patients -- all male with a median age over 65 -- hospitalized with Covid-19 infections. It found no evidence that hydroxychloroquine reduced patients' chances of being put on a mechanical ventilator and that the drug was associated with ''increased overall mortality.''
  But he was wrong that it was the ''only bad survey'' that threw cold water on the efficacy of hydroxychloroquine.
  When Mr. Trump dismissed the study of veterans this month, The Times noted that the current body of research was limited to a few studies criticized for methodological errors and was insufficient to support the use of hydroxychloroquine and chloroquine, another malaria drug, as treatments.
  Since then, more research has been published. Two studies, each observing around 1,400 patients in New York City, concluded that administering hydroxychloroquine was not associated with greatly lower risk of mortality. Smaller studies in France and China reached similar conclusions.
  Reporter: ''The F.D.A. has said hydroxychloroquine should not be used outside of a hospital setting or outside of a research study.''
  Mr. Trump: ''No, that's not what I was told. No.''-- in the cabinet meeting
  False. The F.D.A.'s warning, issued in late April, specifically states that it ''cautions against use of hydroxychloroquine or chloroquine for Covid-19 outside of the hospital setting or a clinical trial due to risk of heart rhythm problems.''
  The agency did authorize the use of the drugs ''for treatment of the virus in hospitalized patients when clinical trials are not available, or participation is not feasible.''
  Mr. Trump seemed aware of the warning just an hour before he denied its existence.
  ''The F.D.A. warned that hydroxychloroquine could cause serious side effects, especially with the heart, with your heart,'' a reporter told the president, after a luncheon with Republican senators.
  ''Yeah. Yeah,'' he responded.

Dozens of times a day in Covid-19 wards across California, a scene like this plays out: A hospital chaplain watches as a death is announced by machine.
Kristin Michealsen, a hospital chaplain in Los Angeles, stood at a man's bedside, holding his hand. His relatives gathered at their home just minutes from the hospital â?they were not allowed into the hospital ward. The patient's heart had just stopped. Ms. Michealsen, an ordained minister, had watched a computer monitor as she accompanied the man to the edge of his life. Eighty beats per minute. Sixty. Forty.
California has averaged 433 daily deaths over the past week. On Tuesday, it became the state with the largest total toll, surpassing New York.
In the depersonalized math of the pandemic, there are two ways to view the ravages of the virus in California. As America's most populous state, it has by far the most cases in the country â?more than 3.4 million â?and now the most deaths. But when adjusted for its large population, California has a lower death rate than 31 states and Washington, D.C.
With about 114 deaths per 100,000 people, the state has about half the rate of New York, New Jersey, Massachusetts or Mississippi. The disparity between New York and California could be even greater when taking into account the likelihood that New York undercounted deaths in the pandemic's frenetic early stages because virus testing was so limited.
Yet these mitigating statistics mean little to the families of the more than 44,900 people killed by the virus in California. Nor do the numbers mean much to chaplains like Ms. Michealsen, who on that day in January when the picture was taken by an Associated Press photographer had already watched two other patients die. Often, she is the only other person in the room when death comes. Sometimes, a nurse holds the other hand of the dying patient.
âWhen we come into this world, we are immediately surrounded by people â?we have human touch,â?Ms. Michealsen said last week from the Providence Holy Cross Medical Center in Los Angeles. âI just think that when we leave this world, we should have the same.â?The pandemic has taken an uneven toll in California, with people in the south and agricultural Central Valley much harder hit than those in the north.
In San Francisco, where almost 350 people have died from the virus, the cruelty of the pandemic â?the inability of families to surround their dying relatives, the interruption of age-old rituals of mourning â?is wearing.
âI've never in 15 years experienced the multiple layers of loss that we are experiencing now,â?said Naomi Tzril Saks, a chaplain at the University of California, San Francisco medical center. Like chaplains across the country, Ms. Saks and her colleagues have done what they can to remedy the cruel isolation of the disease.
âWe've Zoomed in bands and people playing the violin,â?Ms. Saks said. âWe Zoomed in a person's son who was incarcerated, and she hadn't seen him for years before she died.â?Chaplains have gone on virtual retreats to avoid emotional burnout, Ms. Saks said. Some have joined national support groups.
âThere are stories and experiences from this pandemic that will stay in my body for a very long time,â?Ms. Saks said.

2021/2/9,"California has the most coronavirus-related deaths in the U.S. , surpassing New York .",WORLD,"When someone in the family tests positive for the coronavirus, there are some guidelines to follow.
Though I have been writing about Covid-19 for The New York Times for the past two years, I still felt overwhelmed when my son was sent home from school sick in mid-March and tested positive. Suddenly, I was in a cluttered New York City apartment with my husband, first grader and third grader, a lot of virus particles and no clear plan. 
  We did try to isolate positive from negative family members at first and wear masks, but we all got sick anyway. The rolling series of infections lasted for about three weeks, and my symptoms included a 102-degree fever, sore throat and congestion. We were all fully vaccinated, and my husband and I were boosted.
  Could we have done a better job at limiting the virus's impact on our household?
  To answer this, I reached out to seven experts for practical tips for families with young children who test positive for Covid, as the highly transmissible Omicron subvariant BA.2 is circulating.
  Here are answers to some of the questions that I grappled with.
  Should we swab our noses and throats?
  Early detection is vital to slow down transmission, and in Canada and Britain many authorities recommend swabbing the throat, then nostrils to find the virus sooner.  ''A good five seconds on each spot, and each side, is best,'' said Dr. Kashif Pirzada, an attending emergency physician in Toronto. ''There's some good research showing an improvement with the combined approach in the sensitivity of these tests.''
  In the United States, however, there was disagreement. Several experts I spoke with recommended against using nasal rapid tests to swab the throat, largely because the Food and Drug Administration hasn't authorized it. ''We have seen false positives from throat swabs based on the acidity of recent food and beverage consumed,'' said Dr. Eric Ascher, a family medicine doctor affiliated with Lenox Hill Hospital. Others backed trying the method. 
  Is a rapid test enough?
  If family members test positive on a rapid test, it is safe to assume they have Covid, and they should begin isolating and taking precautions, the experts agreed. If they test negative, they should retest frequently while exposed, if possible, and assume they are positive if symptoms begin.
  ''It is important to know that some people do not test positive during the first one to three days of infection,'' said Dr. Michael Mina, an authority on Covid-19 testing and the chief science officer for Emed.
  The experts disagreed about whether it was necessary to also get a P.C.R. test to confirm rapid test results; several said that rapid tests were sufficient. Dr. Pirzada said that confirming results with a P.C.R. is advisable when the first family member gets a positive rapid test or shows symptoms but is not necessary after that. Dr. Ascher said that he prefers the whole family to get the more sensitive P.C.R. test. The bottom line, though, is that people should not wait for positive P.C.R. results to begin isolating and taking precautions.
  Each person who becomes symptomatic or tests positive should begin isolating for at least five days, and longer if they are still feverish or not improving. (Pro tip: Day 1 is the day after taking the test that turned positive or developing symptoms, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention rules).
  In our case, after my son tested positive on a P.C.R., the rest of us did only home tests. We also used rapid tests again to determine when we were no longer contagious -- which many, but not all, experts agree is a best practice to keep others safe. Most people test negative by Day 10, but that time period could range from five to 14 days, meaning a person could be contagious for all that time.
  ''The assumption is that if you don't have enough virus in your nose to trigger a positive result, that you're probably not very contagious. But these things are on a continuum,'' said Dr. Gigi Gronvall, who runs the COVID-19 Testing Toolkit project at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security.
  P.C.R. tests are also helpful in other ways, such as to document disability if you get long Covid. But the downside is, you generally have to leave the house to get them. 
  Should I wear a mask in public if anyone in the house is sick?
  Yes. No matter what, once someone in the household has Covid, everyone -- even the vaccinated who are still negative or asymptomatic -- should wear a well-fitting, high-quality mask for 10 days in public in indoor or crowded outdoor situations.
  Family members who have recently been exposed to Covid and are still testing negative should avoid seeing high-risk people. They should also take precautions while traveling, according to the C.D.C.
  Deciding whether to send well children to school if a household member has Covid is more complex. Unvaccinated children should, according to the C.D.C., stay home for at least five days and then take a virus test. Most districts permit fully vaccinated children to attend school unless they are symptomatic or test positive, but they should wear high-quality masks and get tested at least on the fifth day after exposure, preferably every morning before school, Dr. Mina said.
  If a vaccinated child is highly exposed to Covid at home but is still healthy, parents might consider keeping that child home to protect others. Masks do come off at lunch. But this measure would be going above and beyond the federal recommendations, and only one expert I spoke with recommended it.
  Should I try to reduce exposure in the household, even if it seems futile?
  As parents know, the term ''close contact'' takes on a whole new meaning with young children, who seem to have an uncanny ability to sneeze in your face. Even so, the experts agreed that reducing exposure to each others' illnesses is still worth the effort.
  There is a small window of time when this is particularly important -- between exposure and when the immune system begins to fully engage. 
  Parents have to care for children, and some siblings simply can't be kept apart. Still, there are steps you can take. Whoever gets sick first should be in his or her own room, if possible. Put a HEPA filter in there, if you have one. Try to get the sick person to stay in there for meals. Wear high-quality masks when family members are together.
  Open the windows. Place another HEPA filter, if you have two, where other family members are spending time. Another pro-tip: Keep the air at 40 to 60 percent humidity, which helps stop aerosol transmission, Dr. Pirzada said, by using a hygrometer or a humidifier to measure the level.
  Use common sense. Once the air filters are running, the windows are cracked and masks are worn when possible; attempting more may feel like too much if a young child is ill. ''If my kid were sick, my natural instinct would be to care for them,'' said Dr. Linsey Marr, a leading expert on viral transmission. ''I could see throwing my hands up, relying on the vaccine and my good health to keep me from falling seriously ill and cuddling with my kid.''
  The good news is that once you test positive, exposure to other family members who are also positive is unlikely to make you sicker, the experts agreed. And it isn't likely that the family members who recover first will be reinfected by those still sick.
  Five days after the last family member who had Covid tests negative, others in the household are almost certainly in the clear.
  How can I protect the most vulnerable?
  Covid can be spread before symptoms begin. Within a household, that may mean that everyone has already been exposed even before the first cough or positive test.
  Still, if there is a particularly vulnerable person in the household, like a grandparent, you should focus on keeping the family member safe, even out of the house once someone tests positive. (Keep in mind, though, that the family member may sicken others if already infected.) If the vulnerable person stays in the house, put a HEPA filter in the room if possible and keep the family member separated from others. Contact a doctor for possible treatment possibilities. And of course, wear high-quality masks when interacting and try to keep hands and surfaces clean.
  With Omicron being so contagious, the percentage of household members who get sick once Covid enters the house is higher than with earlier strains. But it is still not 100 percent (one C.D.C. study placed it at between 40 and 70 percent, depending on precautions taken). So stay optimistic! It is possible to remain uninfected.
  ''I got Covid-19 last year and have a new baby in the house,'' said Dr. Mina. ''Between constant wearing of N95s, using HEPA air filters in my home and keeping windows open, I'm the only one in the house that ever contracted Covid.''
  What do I need on hand?
  The experts had some suggestions for a plan to have in place for when someone gets sick:
  Have ready HEPA filters -- or a less expensive, D.I.Y. version you can build yourself, known as a Corsi-Rosenthal box. Decide which bedroom could be an isolation room.
  Have comfortable masks, preferably N95 or KF94 or KN95 masks, for the whole family to wear indoors until they recover.
  Stockpile a few other supplies. Some you might want to consider: a humidifier, a thermometer, Mucinex for adults, Tylenol or Advil, pulse oximeter, sanitizer, rapid tests, disinfecting wipes, electrolyte drinks like Gatorade and Vitamin D3 to boost immunity.
  Ensure family members are up-to-date with their vaccinations.
  Have your doctor's phone number and emergency contacts at hand. If you call right after someone tests positive, your doctor can advise if the family member qualifies for Paxlovid or other new treatments to aid in recovery. Doctors can also tell you when it's time to seek another level of care.
  If you don't have a doctor and live in New York City, call 212-COVID19. There are also now ''Test to Treat'' sites around the country.

2022/4/19,"If Covid Comes Home, What Should You Do?",Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 18,"Xu Zhangrun, a law professor in Beijing known for criticizing the Communist Party, was allowed to go home after being detained a week ago, people familiar with him said.
An outspoken Chinese law professor who has denounced the Communist Party's harsh policies under Xi Jinping was released from detention on Sunday, a week after the police took him away, two people familiar with the professor said. 
  The professor, Xu Zhangrun of Tsinghua University in Beijing, has been one of the few Chinese academics willing to openly and bluntly criticize the Chinese government. In two essays this year, he said that official delay and prevarication had stoked the coronavirus outbreak that emerged in China late last year.
  ''When decisions lead to policy failure, not only should the course be corrected, those responsible must acknowledge their mistakes, appeal in all humility for public forgiveness and be held accountable,'' Professor Xu wrote in an essay in May, according to a translation by Geremie R. BarmÃ©, an Australian Sinologist.
  Professor Xu, 57, first attracted widespread notice in 2018 for a long essay that lamented China's increasingly authoritarian turn under Mr. Xi, the Communist Party leader. Soon after taking power, Mr. Xi launched a drive to discredit liberal ideas such as universal human rights and constitutional limits on party power.
  Professor Xu was barred from teaching and research by Tsinghua University last year, sharply reducing his income, and he has been warned about his criticisms of the Chinese government. Even so, he has continued to write trenchant essays that have been published abroad, and told friends that he accepted the possibility of detention.
  The police took Professor Xu from his home in north Beijing on Monday, and friends said that officers accused him of using prostitutes while traveling in southwest China, an accusation the friends called a malicious slur. The detention prompted widespread criticism abroad, including from the Trump administration and the European Union.
  ''We are deeply concerned by the PRC's detention of Professor Xu Zhangrun for criticizing Chinese leaders amid tightening ideological controls on university campuses in China,'' Morgan Ortagus, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said on Twitter, referring to the People's Republic of China.
  Two people familiar with the professor and his family said that he returned to his home on Sunday morning. Both people asked that their names not be used, citing fear of recrimination by the Chinese authorities.
  The police in Changping, the northern district of Beijing where the professor lives, did not confirm his release, just as they did not confirm his detention last week.

The future of the vaccine rollout
Dr. Anthony Fauci, President Biden's chief medical adviser for Covid-19, said today that most members of the general public could become eligible to get the coronavirus vaccine as early as April.
âI would imagine by the time we get to April, that will be what I would call, for better wording, 'open season,'â?he said. âNamely, virtually everybody and anybody in any category could start to get vaccinated.â?Still, Dr. Fauci said, it will take several months to administer the vaccines. He said that he hoped an overwhelming majority of people in the United States could be vaccinated by mid- to late summer.
For insight into the next few months of the vaccine rollout, we reached out to Katie Thomas, a Times reporter who covers health care and the drug industry.
Will we have enough vaccine doses to meet Dr. Fauci's timeline?
Let's just do the math. We have about 260 million adults in the U.S. The country already has a deal with Moderna and Pfizer for enough doses for 200 million people by halfway through this year. 
And then there's Johnson &amp; Johnson. We have the results from their clinical trial and we know it works â?especially against what we all care about the most, which is severe disease, hospitalization and death. The F.D.A. is considering its application as we speak, and we could expect the Johnson &amp; Johnson vaccine to be authorized as early as the end of this month.
If that happens, we would have another 100 million doses â?enough for 100 million people because it's a single-dose vaccine. So with Moderna, Pfizer and Johnson &amp; Johnson we have enough to vaccinate the entire adult population by the middle of the year â?with some left over.
What other vaccines are we looking for in the near term?
There are two other vaccines that are in the mix. One is AstraZeneca, which has been authorized in more than 50 countries, including Britain. But there are some questions about this vaccine, so people are waiting for the results of the big U.S. trial. If the results are positive, it could be authorized maybe as early as April.
The last vaccine is Novavax, and the company has been enrolling people pretty quickly to its clinical trial in the U.S. and Mexico. If its trial is successful, that vaccine could be available by April.
When will children be vaccinated?
The companies are testing their vaccines in children now, and it's conceivable that kids could get vaccinated later in the year. Dr. Fauci told ProPublica that vaccines for children as young as first graders could be available as early as September.
Aside from getting enough vaccines out to the states, what obstacles do we face?
Sometimes when we think about vaccinating the entire population, we assume that everyone will want one of these vaccines, and we know that's not the case, even just looking at the health care groups.
There have been a few people â?notably Scott Gottlieb, the former F.D.A. commissioner â?who basically say what we're seeing right now is huge demand and not enough supply. But after this first group of early adopters, so to speak, gets vaccinated, we could end up in a situation where we start seeing more supply than demand. Dr. Gottlieb's estimate was by the end of March.
So a big question is: At what point do we have to start persuading others to take the vaccine? And his argument is that might actually come sooner than we think.
Some places, like the U.K., have delayed the second dose of their two-dose vaccines in order to get more people a first dose more quickly. What's the latest thinking in the U.S. on that approach?
I don't think there is anyone in the United States who is in any position of authority who is in favor of significantly delaying the second dose past six weeks.
Dr. Fauci recently said that the science shows that two doses are effective. In order to delay the second dose, we really need to test that out in a clinical trial. If we do that, it's going to take time. And his argument is that, by the time we get an answer to that, we will probably have more supply, and so it's kind of not worth it.
He has also said that delaying the second dose could put selective pressure on the virus that could give rise to more mutations.
What do the variants tell us about what the future will look like?
All of the vaccines that we know about so far have reduced efficacy against the variant from South Africa. Even so, most seem to still offer robust protection against severe disease and death from the variant. And so most of the vaccine makers are talking about developing essentially a booster shot that would address these variants.
The vaccine makers are already starting to think that with the current virus, down the road, we could be headed for a situation where you get an annual Covid-19 shot once a year. And there are even some companies that are starting to talk about combining the flu shot and the Covid-19 shot. But, I should say, we still don't know.
A variant arrives in a U.S. prison
Officials in Michigan confirmed a case of the more transmissible variant first discovered in Britain in an employee at one of the state's prisons.
It's the first documented case of the variant, B.1.1.7, in an American correctional facility, and public health officials fear it could spread rapidly through prisons and jails, which are typically overcrowded and have poor ventilation.
Officials said they had ordered daily testing of all of the more than 1,600 inmates and of staff members at the prison, the Bellamy Creek Correctional Facility in Ionia. As of Thursday, it was not clear whether anyone there aside from the employee had been infected by the new variant.
Unfortunately, some Bellamy Creek inmates were recently transferred to two other prisons, raising concerns that the variant may have traveled with them.
U.S. correctional facilities and detention centers have already been devastated by Covid-19. According to a New York Times database, more than 580,000 people have been infected and at least 2,600 inmates and correctional officers have died.
Vaccine rollout
    â?Countries that are producing vaccines, like China and India, or buying quantities, like the United Arab Emirates, are sending doses to countries where they want to curry favor or thaw frosty relations.
    â?In a bid to get more residents age 75 and older vaccinated, Massachusetts officials said they would also inoculate the people accompanying them, regardless of age.
    â?Mexico authorized China's Sinovac vaccine for emergency use, after authorizing the Russian coronavirus vaccine, Sputnik V, earlier this month.
What else we're following
    â?Robert F. Kennedy Jr. was barred from Instagram for posting false coronavirus and vaccine claims.
    â?Dr. Marcella Nunez-Smith, the chair of President Biden's Covid-19 equity task force, spoke to The New York Times about the challenges ahead.
    â?The director of Britain's genetic surveillance program told the BBC that the coronavirus variant first detected there was going âto sweep the world, in all probability.â?    â?A cougar in Texas became the latest feline to become infected with the virus.
    â?Many people left Europe's cities in the pandemic. What will bring them back
What you're doing
I miss hosting people so much. Coming up with a menu, pouring guests a drink â?it is the best feeling. To help cope with my lack of dinner parties, I decided to make goody bags filled with chocolate, stickers, and hand-painted monogrammed cookies for my girlfriends for Galentine's Day. I dropped them off on their doorsteps, non-contact, and enjoyed the feeling of creating for someone, even if it is from afar.

2021/2/11,Coronavirus Briefing: What Happened Today,US,"With some health care workers still refusing to be immunized, medical centers around the country are requiring shots as cases climb once again.
More and more hospitals and major health systems are requiring employees to get the Covid-19 vaccine, citing rising caseloads fueled by the Delta variant and stubbornly low vaccination rates in their communities and even within their work force. 
  Many hospitals say their efforts to immunize their employees have stalled, in much the same way the nation's overall vaccination rates are stuck under 60 percent, behind many European countries and Canada. While more than 96 percent of doctors say they are fully vaccinated, according to the American Medical Association, health care workers, particularly in rural areas, have proven more resistant even though thousands of workers have died from the virus and countless more became sick.
  One recent estimate indicated that one in four hospital workers were not vaccinated by the end of May, with some facilities reporting that fewer than half of their employees had gotten the shots.
  Some hospitals, ranging from academic medical centers like NewYork-Presbyterian and Yale New Haven to large chains like Trinity Health, are going ahead with a mandate because they recognize that the only way to stop the virus is to vaccinate as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. A large Arizona-based chain, Banner Health, announced Tuesday that it would impose a mandate, and New York City said it would require all health care workers at city-run hospitals or clinics to be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing.
  Watching cases rise prompted Trinity Health, a Catholic system with hospitals in 22 states, to become one of the first major groups to decide earlier this month that it would mandate inoculations. ''We were convinced that the vaccine can save lives,'' said Dr. Daniel Roth, Trinity's chief clinical officer. ''These are preventable deaths.''
  At UF Health Jacksonville, in Florida, the number of Covid patients being treated has surged to levels not seen since January, and only half of its health care workers are vaccinated, said Chad Neilsen, the director of infection prevention. Seventy-five employees are out sick with the virus, the vast majority of whom are unvaccinated, while more are waiting for test results. ''We are absolutely struggling for staffing right now,'' he said.
  ''It's like dÃ©jÃ  vu,'' said Mr. Neilsen, who described growing frustration with colleagues refusing to get the shots. ''We have a reason to believe this could be over if people got vaccinated.''
  Despite dozens of virtual town halls, question-and-answer sessions and educational videos, many employees are wary. ''We still stagnated,'' Mr. Neilsen said.
  Some employees want more data, while others say the process has been too rushed. Many of the same conspiracy theories and misinformation -- that the vaccines will make women infertile or contain microchips -- hold sway among staff members. ''Our health care workers are a reflection of the general population,'' he said.
  Hospital leaders and others plan to meet with state officials in the coming weeks about the possibility of imposing a mandate, he said.
  Unvaccinated workers also continue to care for even the sickest patients, raising concerns that they will spread the infection, especially now that the highly contagious Delta variant comprises more than 80 percent of the nation's cases.
  ''Nowhere is this more important than in hospitals, where health care personnel -- who have been heroic during this pandemic -- are caring for patients with a wide variety of health challenges under the assumption that the health care professionals treating them are not at risk of acquiring or transmitting Covid-19,'' Dr. David J. Skorton, the chief executive of the Association of American Medical Colleges, which represents teaching hospitals, said in a statement last Friday calling for a mandate.
  On Wednesday, two more groups, including the American Hospital Association, joined the growing clamor for vaccine mandates. ''We have lost too many of our caregivers to Covid-19,'' said Dr. Bruce Siegel, the chief executive of America's Essential Hospitals, which represents hospitals in underserved communities. ''Vaccination can reduce the risk we lose more.''
  With formal approval of the vaccines by the Food and Drug Administration potentially months away, hospitals find themselves at the center of the national debate over whether to impose mandates. While the vaccines are being offered under emergency use authorization, supporters argue there is ample evidence that the ones available in the United States are both safe and effective.
  In states like Missouri, which has reported a sharp increase in cases, there is newfound urgency. ''We felt we could not wait,'' said Dr. Shephali Wulff, the director of infectious diseases for SSM Health, a Catholic hospital system whose headquarters are in St. Louis. SSM, where about two-thirds of employees are now vaccinated, is requiring everyone to get their first dose by Sept. 1.
  SSM's decision was also motivated by concern that Covid infections could spike this fall when there could also be a surge in other respiratory infections. ''We need a healthy work force going into the flu season,'' Dr. Wulff said. ''We do not have the time to wait for approval.''
  But some systems are already worried about staffing shortages caused by departures during the pandemic, with many employees quitting because of the stress and burnout experienced by caring for Covid patients. Hospitals are hesitant to risk losing more workers if they force the issue.
  ''They are afraid it could be a tipping point,'' said Ann Marie Pettis, the president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, one of the professional organizations that is urging hospitals to require the vaccine.
  At Mosaic Life Care, a small Missouri hospital group, executives are reluctant to adopt a mandate if other hospitals do not. ''We have the potential to lose some caregivers to other systems,'' said Joey Austin, a spokeswoman for Mosaic, which has vaccinated about 62 percent of its staff.
  Many hospitals already require their employees to get a flu shot, a mandate that has been in place for over a decade. While that was also met by resistance from employees skeptical of the vaccines' safety, it is now largely accepted. Individuals can seek a medical or religious exemption, typically representing a small sliver of the work force, which hospitals say would also apply to the Covid vaccines.
  Mandates ''establish a social norm and say it's an institutional priority,'' said Saad B. Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, who emphasized that hospitals need to strongly encourage workers to voluntarily get the vaccines to be successful.
  Unions like the National Nurses United and 1199 S.E.I.U. say they want members to be vaccinated but oppose making it a condition of employment. At the first hospital to impose a mandate, Houston Methodist, a group of employees sued to challenge the requirement but the lawsuit was recently dismissed. About 150 employees ultimately resigned or were fired for refusing to meet the deadline for vaccination out of a total work force of some 26,000 people.
  Hospitals say they are working hard to dispel much of the pervasive misinformation around the vaccines, even among physicians and nurses.
  ''I have to remind them that reputable scientists do not publish their findings on YouTube,'' Dr. Wulff said. In addition to presenting hard data about the vaccine, she and her colleagues at SSM are also sharing their personal experiences, like getting vaccinated while trying to get pregnant. ''What I'm finding is people are moved by stories and anecdotes,'' she said.
  ''Generally it's a lot of listening and homing in on what is driving their fear,'' Dr. Wulff said.
  Some high-profile systems like Intermountain Healthcare and the Cleveland Clinic are waiting. The clinic, which has a sprawling network of 18 hospitals in the United States, said existing policies, like masking and closely tracking infections, protect patients and workers.
  ''We know if we ensure these safety precautions are in place we know we can continue to keep our patients and caregivers safe,'' said K. Kelly Hancock, the Cleveland Clinic's chief caregiver officer.
  About three-quarters of employees are now vaccinated, and efforts are continuing ''full force,'' she said.
  At Intermountain Healthcare, based in Utah, ''a good majority'' of employees are vaccinated, said Dr. Kristin Dascomb, medical director for infection prevention and control and employee health.
  If more safety data is compelling and the F.D.A. approves the vaccines, Intermountain may require immunization along with other hospitals in the state. ''We are starting the conversation now in Utah,'' she said.
  The lack of full F.D.A. approval has also influenced other hospitals. Mass General Brigham, which has vaccinated more than 85 percent of its work force, said it would adopt the requirement as soon as the vaccines were approved.
  Some hospitals argue a mandate is not necessary. ''In my opinion, there isn't one right answer,'' said Suresh Gunasekaran, the chief executive of the University of Iowa Hospitals & Clinics. About 90 percent of its workers are now vaccinated, he said, adding that he was confident that virtually everyone would be immunized by the end of the year.
  The system has been ''successful in chipping away'' at vaccine hesitancy, Mr. Gunasekaran said, in part because Iowa was involved in the clinical trials for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
  Northwell Health, the large New York hospital group, does not require workers to be immunized against the flu but about 90 percent of its work force is vaccinated against it, said Maxine Carrington, Northwell's chief human resources officer. It is taking a similar approach to Covid.
  ''We want people to be believers,'' Ms. Carrington said, so they are better able to persuade the community at large to get vaccinated. She described the system as ''pounding the pavement on education, education, education.'' About 76 percent of its work force is currently vaccinated against Covid. Northwell will revisit the idea of a mandate after F.D.A. approves the vaccines, she said.
  Yale New Haven Health is now requiring employees to get vaccinated, as have the other hospitals in Connecticut.
  ''From the very beginning, we messaged that it isn't mandatory -- yet. We emphasized the yet,'' said Dr. Thomas Balcezak, the chief clinical officer for Yale.
  ''Health care has to lead,'' he said.

2021/7/22,More Hospitals Are Requiring Workers to Get Covid Vaccines,Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 12,"This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it on Tuesdays and Thursdays.
The 1918 influenza pandemic, the deadliest pandemic in modern history, is typically associated with a single year, but it actually lasted for more than two. The virus that caused it is thought to have emerged in the United States in January of that year, and it claimed its tens of millions of victims quickly. By the summer of 1919, the worst was over. But in some parts of the world, the pandemic dragged on into the spring of 1920, cresting in a fourth wave that killed more people in New York City than the first did.
The United States is now in a fourth wave of another pandemic, and no one is quite sure when this wave will end or whether more will follow. Unlike in 1919 or 1920, state-of-the-art vaccines are widely available in the United States, but hospitalizations keep rising because too many Americans have avoided inoculation. Adding to the sense of unease, the Biden administration this week announced that most Americans should eventually get a third vaccine dose.
How has the Delta variant altered the path of the pandemic, and where will it go next? Here's what people are saying.
Has Delta changed the vaccine calculus?
Just a month ago, the Biden administration was striking a fairly optimistic tone about the country's trajectory â?at least for the vaccinated. âThe good news is that if you are fully vaccinated, you are protected against severe Covid, hospitalization and death and are even protected against the known variants â?including the Delta variant â?circulating in the country,â?Dr. Rochelle Walensky, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention director, said in July.
Why the whiplash? Federal health officials' concern began with data from Israel that suggested that the Pfizer vaccine's protection against severe disease had fallen significantly for people over 60 who got their second shot in January or February. This week the C.D.C. released three studies suggesting that the vaccines' protection against infection had declined.
âWe are concerned that this pattern of decline we are seeing will continue in the months ahead, which could lead to reduced protection against severe disease, hospitalization and death,â?Dr. Vivek Murthy, the surgeon general, said at a White House press briefing.
The cause of the decline remains uncertain: It could result from waning vaccine immunity, but it could also result from a lapse in precautions like mask wearing or the rise of the highly contagious Delta variant â?or a combination of all three.
Yet some public health experts strongly disagree with the Biden administration's decision to recommend third shots, given that billions of people around the world have yet to receive their first. While breakthrough infections are on the rise in some vaccine-rich countries, the C.D.C. studies and other Israeli data indicate that the vaccines remain highly protective against hospitalization across all age groups.
âThese data support giving additional doses of vaccine to highly immunocompromised persons and nursing home residents, not to the general public,â?Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious-disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center and a former pandemic adviser to the Biden administration, told The Times. âFeeling sick like a dog and laid up in bed, but not in the hospital with severe Covid, is not a good enough reasonâ?for universal booster shots, she added. âWe'll be better protected by vaccinating the unvaccinated here and around the world.â?The Biden administration denies any trade-off between a domestic booster program and the global vaccination effort. But many expertsÂ say the trade-off is plain to see. âAnyone who thinks that vaccinating Americans with a third dose is not going to come at the expense of getting the vaccine to other places in the world â?if that's what you think, you're just kidding yourself,â?Scott Hensley, a vaccine researcher at the University of Pennsylvania's Penn Institute for Immunology, told Stat.
The Delta variant hasn't changed the fact that vaccines remain the best way for individuals to protect themselves, Ed Yong wrote in The Atlantic. Adults might need boosters eventually, but he estimated immunity won't wane substantially for at least two years.
But the Delta variant's higher transmissibility does mean that the coronavirus will be a permanent part of our lives; the goal of eradicating it, always unlikely, is now a fantasy. âMost people will meet the virus eventually,â?he wrote. âWe want to ensure that as many people as possible do so with two doses of vaccine in them, and that everyone else does so over as much time as possible.â?Will Delta be the last major variant?
There are three ways the coronavirus could continue to evolve, as Dhruv Khullar, a physician and an assistant professor at Weill Cornell Medical College, explained in The New Yorker:
    â?In the first scenario, the virus simply fails to find a way to escape vaccine-generated immunity. Some scientists think that's a plausible outcome: Many viruses â?measles, mumps, polio and smallpox among them â?have never beaten the vaccines created for them.
    â?In the second scenario, the virus manages to partly evade the vaccines' protections, but at a price (a decline in infectiousness or lethality, for example). This scenario occurred with H.I.V. in the 1990s, when the virus developed a mutation that increased its resistance to an antiviral drug but lowered its rate of replication inside the body.
    â?In the third scenario, the most concerning, the virus manages to find a way around vaccine-generated immunity while maintaining â?or even gaining â?transmissibility or lethality.
Many scientists say that there are biological and epidemiological constraints on how fearsome the coronavirus can become: If it grows too transmissible or too lethal, âit'll burn itself out,â?Nash Rochman, who studies computational genomics at the National Institutes of Health, told Vox.
But no one knows for certain how much evolutionary runway the virus has left. âThere are certainly limits,â?Kristian Andersen, an infectious-disease researcher at the Scripps Research Institute, told Khullar. âWe just have no idea where they are.â?But even if another concerning variant emerges, it won't necessarily spell disaster. As John M. Barry, a historian and the author of âThe Great Influenza,â?noted in The Washington Post, all five flu pandemics we have detailed information about developed more virulent variants before petering out. And if the coronavirus circumvents the vaccines, it will happen gradually, he said, leaving time for vaccine producers to make the necessary adjustments.
âWhether we need booster shots with existing vaccines or not, we will eventually require updated vaccines targeted against the latest variant, just as we do each year for influenza,â?he wrote. âEven if Delta is the worst variant we see, the virus will continue to mutate. As with influenza, the goal is to develop a vaccine that protects against all variants.â?If the coronavirus isn't going away, how do we live with it?
Eventually, experts say, when everyone has been vaccinated or infected, the coronavirus will become endemic: Outbreaks will be rarer and smaller, and hospitalizations and deaths will decline. âThere will be a time in the future when life is like it was two years ago: You run up to someone, give them a hug, get an infection, go through half a box of tissues and move on with your life,â?Jennie Lavine, an infectious-disease researcher at Emory University, told Yong. âThat's where we're headed, but we're not there yet.â?How long it will take to get there remains an open question. In the United States, it's possible that the Delta variant will soon run out of unvaccinated people to infect, as some speculate has occurred in Britain.
But however long it takes to reach endemicity, the road may be rocky, The Atlantic's Sarah Zhang wrote â?especially psychologically. âPeople are having a hard time understanding one another's risk tolerance,â?Julie Downs, a psychologist who studies health decisions at Carnegie Mellon University, told her. âWe need to prepare people that it's not going to come down to zero. It's going to come down to some level we find acceptable.â?We will also need to better understand and treat long Covid, Adam Gaffney and Zackary Berger wrote in The Times. Seventeen months into the pandemic, the link between the coronavirus and the symptoms most people associate with long Covid â?brain fog, severe fatigue, chronic pain, shortness of breath â?is still complicated and not entirely clear. One peer-reviewed study of people who reported long Covid symptoms found that most of those who were tested for antibodies had negative results, suggesting the syndrome may have causes unrelated to the virus.
âNo matter what the underlying cause and whether there is evidence of prior infection, long Covid, even among those with little or no evidence of previous infection, brings significant suffering, including several reported deaths by suicide,â?they wrote. âAction, not just acknowledgment, is needed.â?Do you have a point of view we missed?

2021/8/19,Covid Isn't Going Away. So What Now? Spencer Bokat-Lindell,OPINION,"During the deadly heat wave that blanketed Oregon and Washington in late June, about 600 more people died than would have been typical, a review of mortality data for the week of the crisis shows.
The number is three times as high as the states' official estimates of heat-related deaths so far. It suggests that the true toll of the heat wave, which affected states and provinces across the Pacific Northwest, may be much larger than previously reported. 
  This week, the region is once again steeling itself for extreme heat.
  The New York Times' analysis, based on mortality data reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention by the two states, covers all causes of death, including Covid-19. But the public health agency's initial calculations indicate that only about 60 deaths in the region were related to the coronavirus that week.
  The figures are preliminary. C.D.C. officials said the death count could rise further in coming weeks as the states continue to report. ''Consider it a floor,'' said Lauren Rossen, a health statistician at the agency who works with the mortality data.
  The Times's estimate ''is entirely consistent with a large body of knowledge indicating that days of extreme heat are dangerous and can lead to excess deaths,'' said Greg Wellenius, a professor in environmental health at Boston University who has studied heat-related mortality.
  Evaluating what are termed ''excess deaths'' -- the number of deaths above what would have been typical for a given period of time, based on mortality rates in previous years -- can provide a more complete picture of the effects of extreme heat than official counts of heat-related deaths. Those counts focus on the declared cause of death, for instance, heat stroke. But that can undercount other fatalities that might also have been related to the heat.
  When it's really hot outside, deaths from heat stroke certainly increase,'' said Kate Weinberger, an environmental epidemiologist at the University of British Columbia, ''but deaths from all sorts of other conditions increase as well,'' including from cardiovascular and respiratory disease.
  Understanding the full consequences of extreme heat on mortality is important because it can help communities better plan for future heat waves, which are becoming more common. Heat deaths are largely preventable, said Kristie Ebi, a professor in the Center for Health and the Global Environment at the University of Washington. ''The more we understand about these deaths, the better we can prepare.''
  During the last week of June, temperatures in the Pacific Northwest climbed more than 30 degrees Fahrenheit higher than average, smashing records and bringing life-threatening conditions to an area not used to such extreme heat.
  An analysis by an international team of climate researchers found that such an intense heat wave would have been virtually impossible without the influence of human-caused climate change.
  Washington state has officially reported that 95 people died from heat-related causes during the week of the heat wave, but investigations are continuing. Oregon has confirmed 96 heat-related deaths so far.
  But the states' excess deaths figures -- nearly 450 extra deaths in Washington, and nearly 160 in Oregon, which has a little more than half the population of its northern neighbor -- suggest the official figures severely underestimate the heat wave's effect on mortality.
  Even amid the Coronavirus epidemic, the spike in deaths reported by Washington was exceptionally large. More people in the state died during the week of the heat wave than during any other single week of the pandemic, according to the C.D.C. data.
  Officials in British Columbia, just across the Canadian border, recently reported more than 400 heat-related deaths during the week of the heat wave -- a stunning number closer in line with the excess-death estimate for Washington state. The province's coroner service told the Times there were around 600 more deaths than would have been typical during the same period, but said the number could be incomplete.
  Extreme heat disproportionately affects vulnerable populations, including older people, homeless people and those who work outdoors. Access to air-conditioning can be a life saver. A preliminary review of deaths during the heat wave in Multnomah County, Ore., which includes Portland, found that none of the 54 people who died had central air-conditioning.
  ''Not everyone can stay at home all day in an air-conditioned space,'' Dr. Wellenius of Boston University said. ''Not everyone can afford an air conditioner.''
  Understanding the groups most at risk for heat-related death and where those deaths occurred can guide public health officials to better direct their resources, including where to set up cooling centers during future crises. That will require more detailed local analysis.
  The New York Times excess deaths analysis is based on state-level mortality data published by the C.D.C. during the Coronavirus epidemic. The Times has previously used the data to gauge the impact of the virus.
  Public health researchers regularly use excess deaths to measure the effects of catastrophic events like extreme heat. A recent study by Dr. Weinberger and Dr. Wellenius estimated that about 5,600 deaths nationwide could be attributed to elevated temperatures each year. That number is significantly higher than the 700 heat-related deaths per year officially estimated based on reported causes of death.
  But deaths are only one measure of the heat wave's impact on health. Though heat-related deaths disproportionately affect older people, high temperatures can make people of all ages sick and lead to hospitalizations.
  An analysis made public last week reported a sharp rise in emergency department visits in the Pacific Northwest during the heat wave in late June. Between June 25 and June 30, nearly 3,000 emergency department visits were recorded for heat-related illness.
  On June 28th alone, more than 1,000 heat-related visits to emergency departments were reported, compared with fewer than 10 visits during the same period in 2019.
  Yet, researchers said the rapid analysis very likely underestimates the full impact of the heat. (They relied on a keyword search to identify heat-related emergency department visits that might miss some cases and did not capture visits to other sites where patients might seek care, such as urgent care centers.)
  When temperatures rise, people can become severely ill, or even die, if the body is unable to effectively sweat and cool off. High humidity increases the risk, because sweat can't evaporate as quickly. That can lead to an increase in internal body temperature, which can cause muscles and enzymes to stop working and organs to shut down.
  Dr. Steven Mitchell, medical director for emergency services at Harborview Medical Center in Seattle, described heat-related illness as a usually ''rare phenomenon'' in the city. During the heat wave, Harborview and its affiliated hospitals treated at least 100 patients for heat-related illness. Dr. Mitchell, who has worked at Harborview for 15 years, said that before this year he couldn't remember treating a single case of severe heat illness or heat stroke.
  The demands on hospital staff and equipment, including ventilators, during the heat wave reminded him of the early days of the Covid-19 pandemic, Dr. Mitchell said. ''In an unprecedented year, this is once again unprecedented.''
  Methodology
  The top chart shows the reported number of weekly deaths above or below normal. It reflects deaths officially reported to the C.D.C. without weighting for underreporting. That means deaths in recent weeks are likely undercounted because there is a lag in time between when a death occurs and when the death certificate is completed, submitted to the C.D.C. and processed for reporting purposes. The chart includes all weeks for which the C.D.C. estimates the data to be at least 90 percent complete. For Washington, that includes data through the week ending July 17, 2021. For Oregon, that includes data through the week ending July 10, 2021.
  The expected number of deaths for each week was calculated by the C.D.C. based on mortality data from 2013 to 2019, adjusted to account for trends over time, like population changes and seasonal patterns. The agency also estimates what proportion of the weekly reported deaths are attributed to Covid-19.

2021/8/12,Deaths From Heat Wave Likely Underreported,Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 20,"Some loyalty programs are extending customers' elite status, lengthening expiration dates on rewards and more. Here's how to navigate them.
Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. For the latest updates, read The New York Times's Covid-19 coverage here. 
  You got a fancy hotel credit card thinking that you'd travel often this year and redeem your free-night benefit during a luxury beach vacation. Then came coronavirus. Losing out on a free hotel room isn't the worst problem to have right now, but it's fair for frequent travelers to worry about what will happen to all of those hard-earned points, especially if you're holding a credit card with a steep annual fee.
  But there's some good news: Some -- but not all -- loyalty programs are extending customers' status, lengthening expiration dates on rewards and more. Here's what you need to know about the biggest hotel programs, and how they are helping customers during the coronavirus crisis.
  Check on a status extension and expiration dates for points
  Hotel points generally expire if your account is inactive for a year or so. Since you can't travel right now, many chains are postponing expiration dates. Both Hilton and Hyatt have said that points that would have expired in March 2020 or later now won't expire until Dec. 31, 2020.
  Some hotels are reducing the requirements to obtain elite status, which grants benefits like late checkout, room upgrades and free breakfast. IHG's minimum stay requirement for Elite Status dropped from 40 nights to 30 nights. And Hilton is automatically extending elite benefits until March 31, 2022 for all members who currently hold status.
  Don't fret about losing vouchers like free night certificates
  Expiration dates are also being extended for free night certificates and other vouchers like club lounge passes. All Marriott free night awards that would have expired in 2020 now don't expire until Jan. 31, 2021. Hyatt's vouchers that would have expired between March and December 2020 don't expire until the end of 2021. Even if your hotel won't automatically extend an expiring certificate, call and ask.
  NEED MORE HELP? If you can't figure out which credit cards to keep in your wallet, sign up for Wirecutter Money's Credit Card Checkup.
  Earn points from your couch now to use later
  You can't travel for a while, but you can put in work today to keep your account active and gain points toward a future trip. Some loyalty programs, like IHG and Hilton, allow you to earn points for filling out surveys. IHG also has a program called IHG Rewards Club Dining that gives you points by spending money with partner restaurants (ordering takeout counts!).
  Consider putting your hotel credit card on pause
  Hotel-branded credit cards often give rewards for everyday purchases, which may tempt you to keep using them. Many Hilton credit cards earn bonus points at gas stations and supermarkets and restaurants in the United States. But since points can only be redeemed at Hilton hotels, you may want to pause your spending on that credit card (to keep it active, just put a small recurring charge on it, like a streaming service, then set the bill to autopay each month). It might make more sense for the time being to use a credit card that earns cash back instead, since you can put the money you earn from your grocery store purchases this month toward paying off bills or any other expenses.
  And if the annual fee is making you want to part ways with your hotel credit card, it's OK to cancel it. Or consider downgrading it to a no-annual-fee version. Most banks allow you to cancel your credit card within 30 to 60 days of your annual fee being billed (you typically receive the fee back as a statement credit). Even if you miss that window, most banks allow you to cancel your card at any time and may give you a prorated refund on the annual fee. Or, ask customer service for a retention offer -- they might waive the annual fee, or give you a statement credit or bonus points in exchange for not canceling the account.

2020/4/23,Making the Most of Hotel Loyalty Programs When You're Not Traveling Travel Tips,TRAVEL,"A handful of hotels are moving ahead with scheduled openings, whether or not the guests will arrive.
Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. For the latest updates, read The New York Times's Covid-19 coverage here.
The hotelier Phil Hospod has spent the last two years building The Wayfinder, a boutique hotel in Newport, R.I. And despite the pandemic, he is still planning to open in mid-May.
The hotel, which will have an outdoor pool deck, an on-site restaurant serving coastal cuisine and seersucker-inspired rooms, was nearing completion when Gov. Gina M. Raimondo of Rhode Island issued a strict stay-at-home order on March 28, banning all gatherings of more than five people.
âWe're really close, which is kind of exciting, but also the painful part,â?Mr. Hospod said.
But he's plowing ahead and says that once the government gives the green light, he could open his doors within two weeks. He has had to make some adjustments: Covid-19 has stalled deliveries â?his mattresses are stuck in New York, his art in Ohio and a lobby fireplace in California. So he has begun relying more on local suppliers, and has also set up sanitation stations across the site for his construction crew (who are allowed to work). Unable to conduct job interviews in person, he's interviewing front desk staff, bartenders, cleaning crews and more via videoconferencing.
The hotel industry has shed more than four million American jobs in the wake of Covid-19, and an industry analytics company, STR, reports more than 80 percent of rooms in the U.S. are currently empty. But a handful of hotels are nevertheless moving ahead with planned openings, offering their properties as a port in a very uncertain storm.
Greg Henderson, co-owner of The Roxbury at Stratton Falls, a whimsical resort comprised of themed cottages and mansion rooms in New York's Catskill Mountains, was gearing up for a grand opening this spring. He now hopes to open June 1.
âFrom a business perspective, this is the scariest thing I've ever been through in my life,â?he admits.
To conduct a deep cleaning of the property, he is employing a staggered schedule of cleaners who work in individual shifts, without punching timecards and without entering the hotel's front office, where he also keeps a single employee.
And some hotels that had opened their doors when the pandemic hit have found that it makes more economic sense to stay open, if only for one or two guests each night.
At The Abbey Inn and Spa in New York's Hudson Valley, the general manager Gilbert Baeriswil finds himself on unfamiliar ground, even with more than 30 years in the hotel industry.
His property opened on March 18, two days before Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued a stay-at-home order because of the coronavirus pandemic.
The Abbey, a boutique hotel in a converted convent in the Hudson Valley, had hired a staff of 45, but with reservations plummeting to single digits (including those for some emergency medical workers), it now has a skeleton crew of 10. Tables at Apropos, the hotel's farm-to-table restaurant, were first moved so guests could sit at least six feet apart; they soon made the shift to takeout only. Daily housekeeping is paused; cleaning staff, armed with masks, enter rooms only after check out.
âWe knew this was going to be a different beast than any normal opening,â?said Mr. Baeriswil. But a great deal of resources had already been spent on training staff, so the owners decided it made more sense to stay open.
When John Castle, general manager of the AC Hotel Little Rock Downtown in Arkansas, opened the property on Feb. 18, the fallout from a pandemic was the last thing on his mind.
âWe had never heard of it at that point,â?he said of the virus, which has since killed more than 25,000 Americans. Arkansas is one of only seven states nationwide without a stay-at-home order, but Mr. Castle said the impact has nevertheless been brutal: Occupancy has plummeted to 5 percent.
âI've been running hotels for 10 years and have never seen occupancy in the single digits,â?he said.
Yet the AC Hotel remains open.
âEven if you close a hotel completely, someone has to stay there as a caretaker. So there isn't a huge savings as long as you're still getting a couple rooms a night,â?Mr. Castle said.
In Florida, the website of The Ben, a waterfront property in West Palm Beach, informs its virtual visitors that only essential lodgers â?like emergency medical workers and displaced residents â?are able to book rooms (the same mandate holds in New York state). That hotel, which opened on Feb. 13, has provided each guest with a welcome letter explaining its adaptation to the crisis: its gym and pool are shuttered, food service is takeout only and housekeeping is suspended (cleaning staff waits five days after checkout before entering rooms).
Meanwhile, some hotels are finding more socially distanced ways to debut.
In El Paso, the Plaza Hotel Pioneer Park is still scheduled to reopen in April after a two-year renovation, with a caveat. The property kicked off a âdigital soft launchâ?on April 10 while staff wait for Texas's shelter-in-place order, which went into effect on April 2, to lift.
The launch includes a weekly live Instagram series with Andres Padilla, executive chef at the hotel's Ambar restaurant, who is taking viewers into the hotel's kitchen while he makes dishes like ceviche and pork carnitas.
The Instagram series is important, Mr. Padilla says, not just to connect with guests who can't yet visit but also to keep up morale among his staff.
âNone of us have ever l lived through anything like this,â?he said. âIf I'm worried, they'll never know â?because then they'll worry.â?Follow NY Times Travel on Twitter, Instagram and Facebook.

2020/4/26,Opening in the Outbreak,Section TR; Column 0; Travel Desk; Pg. 2; TRENDING,"Xu Zhangrun, a law professor in Beijing known for criticizing the Communist Party, was allowed to go home after being detained a week ago, people familiar with him said.
An outspoken Chinese law professor who has denounced the Communist Party's harsh policies under Xi Jinping was released from detention on Sunday, a week after the police took him away, two people familiar with the professor said.
The professor, Xu Zhangrun of Tsinghua University in Beijing, has been one of the few Chinese academics willing to openly and bluntly criticize the Chinese government. In two essays this year, he said that official delay and prevarication had stoked the coronavirus outbreak that emerged in China late last year.
âWhen decisions lead to policy failure, not only should the course be corrected, those responsible must acknowledge their mistakes, appeal in all humility for public forgiveness and be held accountable,â?Professor Xu wrote in an essay in May, according to a translation by Geremie R. BarmÃ©, an Australian Sinologist.
Professor Xu, 57, first attracted widespread notice in 2018 for a long essay that lamented China's increasingly authoritarian turn under Mr. Xi, the Communist Party leader. Soon after taking power, Mr. Xi launched a drive to discredit liberal ideas such as universal human rights and constitutional limits on party power.
Professor Xu was barred from teaching and research by Tsinghua University last year, sharply reducing his income, and he has been warned about his criticisms of the Chinese government. Even so, he has continued to write trenchant essays that have been published abroad, and told friends that he accepted the possibility of detention.
The police took Professor Xu from his home in north Beijing on Monday, and friends said that officers accused him of using prostitutes while traveling in southwest China, an accusation the friends called a malicious slur. The detention prompted widespread criticism abroad, including from the Trump administration and the European Union.
âWe are deeply concerned by the PRC's detention of Professor Xu Zhangrun for criticizing Chinese leaders amid tightening ideological controls on university campuses in China,â?Morgan Ortagus, a spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said on Twitter, referring to the People's Republic of China.
Two people familiar with the professor and his family said that he returned to his home on Sunday morning. Both people asked that their names not be used, citing fear of recrimination by the Chinese authorities.
The police in Changping, the northern district of Beijing where the professor lives, did not confirm his release, just as they did not confirm his detention last week.

2020/7/12,Outspoken Chinese Professor Is Said to Be Released From Detention,WORLD; asia,"The evangelical leader's relief group has been criticized for requiring workers at its field hospital to say they oppose same-sex marriage.
The Rev. Franklin Graham on Tuesday accused elected officials and others in New York of harassment over their criticism of his medical organization, which is operating a field hospital in Central Park for coronavirus patients that requires workers to sign a pledge that they are Christians who oppose same-sex marriage. 
Mr. Graham posted his accusation on Facebook hours before Mount Sinai Health Systems, which teamed up with his organization, Samaritan's Purse, last month, informed state lawmakers that it would begin requiring those who work for the group to sign a second pledge vowing not to discriminate against patients.
Mr. Graham said Samaritan's Purse, a nondenominational evangelical organization that often works in developing countries, had never discriminated against a patient. But he said that the group had a right to âlawfully hire staff who share our Christian beliefsâ?because it is a religious charity.
âIt seems tone-deaf to be attacking our religious conviction about marriage at the very moment thousands of New Yorkers are fighting for their lives and dozens of Samaritan's Purse workers are placing their lives at risk to provide critical medical care,â?he wrote. 
Samaritan's Purse has treated 130 patients in the 68-bed Central Park hospital since it opened on April 1, the group said on Tuesday. But its role in the response to the virus in New York has been criticized because of its position on L.G.B.T. issues and the past statements and political activities of Mr. Graham, a vocal supporter of President Trump.
On Sunday, Mr. Graham delivered an Easter message on Fox News while standing in front of his group's medical tents in Central Park. In the message, which included footage of virus patients with their faces obscured, he described the pandemic in terms similar to those used by the president: âa stormâ?that ânone of us anticipatedâ?and ânobody expected.â?On Tuesday, Mr. Graham said that critics had been harassing Samaritan's Purse with information requests while it was busy trying to save lives. He specifically mentioned the New York City Commission on Human Rights; the Reclaim Pride Coalition, a progressive L.G.B.T. group; and Democratic members of Congress.
âIf any of these groups had funded and erected their own emergency field hospitals to serve Covid-19 patients in Central Park, we would join what we believe would be most New Yorkers â?and Americans â?in applauding and praying for them, not harassing them,â?he wrote on Facebook.
Last week, four Democratic members of New York's congressional delegation sent a letter to Kenneth L. Davis, the president of Mount Sinai Health System, Mayor Bill de Blasio and Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo asking how the Samaritan's Purse field hospital would operate. The lawmakers also asked how the group came to be involved in the virus response in New York.
âNow more than ever, New York City must uphold its values and ensure that every New Yorker feels safe in seeking medical attention,â?the lawmakers wrote. 
In his statement, Mr. Graham said such requests had the effect of âdiverting precious resources of time and energy and personnel away from serving Covid-19 patientsâ?at a time when âthe death toll in New York continues to climb.â?Mount Sinai has been criticized for weeks over its decision to collaborate with Samaritan's Purse. Jason Kaplan, a spokesman for the hospital network, said the decision was based on the fact that âthis virus kills people of every religious beliefs, ethnicity, gender identity and sexual orientation.â?Mr. Kaplan also said that Samaritan's Purse had agreed to adhere to Mount Sinai's anti-discrimination policies. 
âMount Sinai and Samaritan's Purse are unified in our mission to provide the same world-class care to anyone and everyone who needs it,â?Mr. Kaplan said in an email. âNo questions asked.â?Mr. Graham has defended the group's views and its âstatement of faithâ?as a matter of religious freedom. But the group's vision of Christianity, and the role it plays in its operations, has caused concern in New York, including among some Christians. 
Last week, a plan to turn the Cathedral of St. John the Divine, the seat of the Episcopal Diocese of New York, into a virus hospital was abruptly shelved after tension between the diocese, which promotes a more inclusive form of Christianity, and Samaritan's Purse, whose workers were set to staff the facility. 
Mount Sinai said the plan was put on hold because the number of virus-related hospitalizations in New York had begun to level off.  Behind the scenes, though, Episcopal leaders said they believed it might still have proceeded if Samaritan's Purse had not been involved.

2020/4/15,Franklin Graham Says He Is Being Harassed Over Central Park Hospital,NYREGION,"With some health care workers still refusing to be immunized, medical centers around the country are requiring shots as cases climb once again.
More and more hospitals and major health systems are requiring employees to get the Covid-19 vaccine, citing rising caseloads fueled by the Delta variant and stubbornly low vaccination rates in their communities and even within their work force.
Many hospitals say their efforts to immunize their employees have stalled, in much the same way the nation's overall vaccination rates are stuck under 60 percent, behind many European countries and Canada. While more than 96 percent of doctorssay they are fully vaccinated, according to the American Medical Association, health care workers, particularly in rural areas, have proven more resistant even though thousands of workers have died from the virus and countless more became sick.
One recent estimate indicated that one in four hospital workers were not vaccinated by the end of May, with some facilities reporting that fewer than half of their employees had gotten the shots.
Some hospitals, ranging from academic medical centers like NewYork-Presbyterian and Yale New Haven to large chains like Trinity Health, are going ahead with a mandate because they recognize that the only way to stop the virus is to vaccinate as many people as possible, as quickly as possible. A large Arizona-based chain, Banner Health, announced Tuesday that it would impose a mandate, and New York City said it would require all health care workers at city-run hospitals or clinics to be vaccinated or undergo weekly testing.
Watching cases rise prompted Trinity Health, a Catholic system with hospitals in 22 states, to become one of the first major groups to decide earlier this month that it would mandate inoculations. âWe were convinced that the vaccine can save lives,â?said Dr. Daniel Roth, Trinity's chief clinical officer. âThese are preventable deaths.â?At UF Health Jacksonville, in Florida, the number of Covid patients being treated has surged to levels not seen since January, and only half of its health care workers are vaccinated, said Chad Neilsen, the director of infection prevention. Seventy-five employees are out sick with the virus, the vast majority of whom are unvaccinated, while more are waiting for test results. âWe are absolutely struggling for staffing right now,â?he said.
âIt's like dÃ©jÃ  vu,â?said Mr. Neilsen, who described growing frustration with colleagues refusing to get the shots. âWe have a reason to believe this could be over if people got vaccinated.â?Despite dozens of virtual town halls, question-and-answer sessions and educational videos, many employees are wary. âWe still stagnated,â?Mr. Neilsen said.
Some employees want more data, while others say the process has been too rushed. Many of the same conspiracy theories and misinformation â?that the vaccines will make women infertile or contain microchips â?hold sway among staff members. âOur health care workers are a reflection of the general population,â?he said.
Hospital leaders and others plan to meet with state officials in the coming weeks about the possibility of imposing a mandate, he said.
Unvaccinated workers also continue to care for even the sickest patients, raising concerns that they will spread the infection, especially now that the highly contagious Delta variant comprises more than 80 percent of the nation's cases.
âNowhere is this more important than in hospitals, where health care personnel â?who have been heroic during this pandemic â?are caring for patients with a wide variety of health challenges under the assumption that the health care professionals treating them are not at risk of acquiring or transmitting Covid-19,â?Dr. David J. Skorton, the chief executive of the Association of American Medical Colleges, which represents teaching hospitals, said in a statement last Friday calling for a mandate.
On Wednesday, two more groups, including the American Hospital Association, joined the growing clamor for vaccine mandates. âWe have lost too many of our caregivers to Covid-19,â?said Dr. Bruce Siegel, the chief executive of America's Essential Hospitals, which represents hospitals in underserved communities. âVaccination can reduce the risk we lose more.â?With formal approval of the vaccines by the Food and Drug Administration potentially months away, hospitals find themselves at the center of the national debate over whether to impose mandates. While the vaccines are being offered under emergency use authorization, supporters argue there is ample evidence that the ones available in the United States are both safe and effective.
In states like Missouri, which has reported a sharp increase in cases, there is newfound urgency. âWe felt we could not wait,â?said Dr. Shephali Wulff, the director of infectious diseases for SSM Health, a Catholic hospital system whose headquarters are in St. Louis. SSM, where about two-thirds of employees are now vaccinated, is requiring everyone to get their first dose by Sept. 1.
SSM's decision was also motivated by concern that Covid infections could spike this fall when there could also be a surge in other respiratory infections. âWe need a healthy work force going into the flu season,â?Dr. Wulff said. âWe do not have the time to wait for approval.â?But some systems are already worried about staffing shortages caused by departures during the pandemic, with many employees quitting because of the stress and burnout experienced by caring for Covid patients. Hospitals are hesitant to risk losing more workers if they force the issue.
âThey are afraid it could be a tipping point,â?said Ann Marie Pettis, the president of the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology, one of the professional organizations that is urging hospitals to require the vaccine.
At Mosaic Life Care, a small Missouri hospital group, executives are reluctant to adopt a mandate if other hospitals do not. âWe have the potential to lose some caregivers to other systems,â?said Joey Austin, a spokeswoman for Mosaic, which has vaccinated about 62 percent of its staff.
Many hospitals already require their employees to get a flu shot, a mandate that has been in place for over a decade. While that was also met by resistance from employees skeptical of the vaccines' safety, it is now largely accepted. Individuals can seek a medical or religious exemption, typically representing a small sliver of the work force, which hospitals say would also apply to the Covid vaccines.
Mandates âestablish a social norm and say it's an institutional priority,â?said Saad B. Omer, the director of the Yale Institute for Global Health, who emphasized that hospitals need to strongly encourage workers to voluntarily get the vaccines to be successful.
Unions like the National Nurses United and 1199 S.E.I.U. say they want members to be vaccinated but oppose making it a condition of employment. At the first hospital to impose a mandate, Houston Methodist, a group of employees sued to challenge the requirement but the lawsuit was recently dismissed. About 150 employees ultimately resigned or were fired for refusing to meet the deadline for vaccination out of a total work force of some 26,000 people.
Hospitals say they are working hard to dispel much of the pervasive misinformation around the vaccines, even among physicians and nurses.
âI have to remind them that reputable scientists do not publish their findings on YouTube,â?Dr. Wulff said. In addition to presenting hard data about the vaccine, she and her colleagues at SSM are also sharing their personal experiences, like getting vaccinated while trying to get pregnant. âWhat I'm finding is people are moved by stories and anecdotes,â?she said.
âGenerally it's a lot of listening and homing in on what is driving their fear,â?Dr. Wulff said.
Some high-profile systems like Intermountain Healthcare and the Cleveland Clinic are waiting. The clinic, which has a sprawling network of 18 hospitals in the United States, said existing policies, like masking and closely tracking infections, protect patients and workers.
âWe know if we ensure these safety precautions are in place we know we can continue to keep our patients and caregivers safe,â?said K. Kelly Hancock, the Cleveland Clinic's chief caregiver officer.
About three-quarters of employees are now vaccinated, and efforts are continuing âfull force,â?she said.
At Intermountain Healthcare, based in Utah, âa good majorityâ?of employees are vaccinated, said Dr. Kristin Dascomb, medical director for infection prevention and control and employee health.
If more safety data is compelling and the F.D.A. approves the vaccines, Intermountain may require immunization along with other hospitals in the state. âWe are starting the conversation now in Utah,â?she said.
The lack of full F.D.A. approval has also influenced other hospitals. Mass General Brigham, which has vaccinated more than 85 percent of its work force, said it would adopt the requirement as soon as the vaccines were approved.
Some hospitals argue a mandate is not necessary. âIn my opinion, there isn't one right answer,â?said Suresh Gunasekaran, the chief executive of the University of Iowa Hospitals &amp; Clinics. About 90 percent of its workers are now vaccinated, he said, adding that he was confident that virtually everyone would be immunized by the end of the year.
The system has been âsuccessful in chipping awayâ?at vaccine hesitancy, Mr. Gunasekaran said, in part because Iowa was involved in the clinical trials for the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine.
Northwell Health, the large New York hospital group, does not require workers to be immunized against the flu but about 90 percent of its work force is vaccinated against it, said Maxine Carrington, Northwell's chief human resources officer. It is taking a similar approach to Covid.
âWe want people to be believers,â?Ms. Carrington said, so they are better able to persuade the community at large to get vaccinated. She described the system as âpounding the pavement on education, education, education.â?About 76 percent of its work force is currently vaccinated against Covid. Northwell will revisit the idea of a mandate after F.D.A. approves the vaccines, she said.
Yale New Haven Health is now requiring employees to get vaccinated, as have the other hospitals in Connecticut.
âFrom the very beginning, we messaged that it isn't mandatory â?yet. We emphasized the yet,â?said Dr. Thomas Balcezak, the chief clinical officer for Yale.
âHealth care has to lead,â?he said.

2021/7/21,More Hospitals Are Requiring Workers to Get Covid Vaccines,HEALTH,"Tuesday: State leaders cheered Senator Kamala Harris's ascension. Now Gov. Gavin Newsom has to figure out who should replace her.
Good morning.
Gov. Gavin Newsom has been coy, and so have the contenders.
But make no mistake: California's politicos are all guessing whom the governor will pick to replace Senator Kamala Harris when she is sworn in as vice president on Jan. 20.
Jockeying for the seat started the day President-elect Joseph R. Biden Jr. picked Ms. Harris as his running mate â?arguably even sooner, if you count the days when she and a fellow Californian, Representative Karen Bass, shot to the top of the âveepstakes.â?It is, as Raphael Sonenshein, the executive director of the Pat Brown Institute for Public Affairs at Cal State Los Angeles, put it, âa game of musical chairs like you've never seen before.â?[See all the California election results here.]
The speculation has been wild, and the list of possibilities is long.
Asked in August whether would-be candidates had started pitching themselves for the job, Mr. Newsom laughed.
âYou may be the only one who hasn't, unless you just did â?and that is only a slight exaggeration,â?the governor responded.
On Monday, the governor once again declined to talk about whom he's considering and wouldn't give a timeline for his decision, noting that the current occupant of the White House still hadn't conceded and that he also hadn't been able to talk with Ms. Harris âvis-Ã -vis her own timeline and needs.â?âThe process is just beginning to unfold,â?Mr. Newsom said.
As my colleague Shawn Hubler previously reported, Mr. Newsom will have to balance many, potentially competing, considerations in making his choice.
Ms. Harris, for instance, is only the second Black woman in the U.S. Senate. Many Californians may want to see another Black woman or woman of color fill the seat. Ms. Bass's name has come up, as has that of Representative Barbara Lee and Mayor London Breed of San Francisco.
But Latinos make up roughly 40 percent of the state's population, and the state has never had a Latino senator.
Political observers have noted Mr. Newsom's penchant for being able to call his moves history-making. And two of his top administration officials, Attorney General Xavier Becerra and Secretary of State Alex Padilla, are Latino men.
Mr. Sonenshein told me recently that another major consideration will be who will be able to hang on to the seat in 2022.
[Read the full story from August on the jockeying for Ms. Harris's Senate seat.]
While Mr. Becerra has raised his profile in recent years, leading the state's many lawsuits against the Trump administration, Mr. Padilla has been front and center in the orchestration of a consequential election during a pandemic â?which still drew record-breaking turnoutand went off mostly without a hitch.
Ms. Bass, he said, is âa quiet force, but is very well-liked in the Democratic Party.â?The calculus will change once some of the potential picks are snapped up by the Biden administration. Mr. Becerra, for instance, could be in contention for a position leading a Biden Justice Department.
Mr. Sonenshein said he saw Mr. Padilla as âin the lead,â?and Mr. Becerra and Ms. Bass as rounding out a kind of top tier of likely contenders.
Still, Mr. Sonenshein said, âLots of surprises are possible.â?[Read more from Politico about which Californians might be tapped for the Biden-Harris administration.]
One common denominator signals a perhaps more interesting shift in the state, though, Mr. Sonenshein said: âThe top three are all from Southern California.â?For years, he said, there's been a sense that Northern California Democratsâpass jobs around.â?But if the governor chooses a senator with ties to Southern California, hot on the heels of high-profile progressive victories in Los Angeles, it would fuel the notion that the center of Democratic politics â?in California and, by extension, the nation â?has moved south.
In any case, Mr. Newsom is still dealing with a raging pandemic. On Monday, he emphasized that's his top priority.

An update on the pandemic
California officials on Monday pleaded with residents to remain vigilant about wearing masks and staying away from friends and loved ones, as encouraging news spread about Pfizer's vaccine work and Mr. Biden's election heralded shifts in the nation's Covid-19 response.
âPlease, please let us double down on the work we have done,â?Mr. Newsom said on Monday. âI'm not trying to take away any enthusiasm, I'm trying to be honest and forthright.â?Speaking for the first time since the election was called, Mr. Newsom's tone was a mix of optimistic and foreboding.
[Track coronavirus case numbers by California county.]
Case numbers, he said, had begun to rise across the state, as had hospitalizations. Although testing has ramped up, reaching almost 190,000 tests reported over the past day, the state's average positivity rate over the past two weeks had risen to 3.7 percent after reaching a low of 2.5 percent early last month.
Cold weather has arrived in some areas and holidays continue to approach, which officials have worried is leading to more in-person, indoor gatherings. Counties across the state were likely to be moved into more restrictive reopening tiers this week.
[Read more about California's tiered reopening plan.]
Still, Mr. Newsom lauded California's response and said that while he looked forward to working âhand in gloveâ?with a Biden administration on the distribution of a coronavirus vaccine, the state was pressing ahead with its independent vaccine safety review.
Earlier in the day, Mr. Biden announced that he had tapped a team of health experts, including three from the University of California, San Francisco, to help guide his Covid-19 response â?a move Mr. Newsom celebrated as evidence of California's deep pool of scientists and renowned researchers.
But he emphasized that figuring out who should get what are expected to be extremely limited doses of a vaccine will still be difficult, nuanced work that requires an understanding of California's specific underserved communities.
âWe have millions of health care workers in California,â?he said. California's share of early vaccine doses, he said, âwon't even be able to cover all the health care workers in the state.â?Read more:

2020/11/10,The Next Big Question for California Politicians California Today,US,"Bike Week typically draws a half-million people to the Daytona Beach area, but a smaller crowd is expected this year. Still, some worry that it could be a superspreader event.
About 300,000 people are expected to descend on Daytona Beach, Fla., this week for a large annual motorcycle rally called Bike Week that is taking place during a pandemic in a state with few restrictions to slow its spread.
Excitement about the event has been tempered by pushback from some motorcycle enthusiasts in a Facebook group dedicated to the rally who feared it could turn into a coronavirus superspreader event. Last August, the Sturgis motorcycle rally in South Dakota drew more than 450,000 bikers, most of whom did not wear masks or appear to follow social-distancing guidelines.
State health officials in South Dakota said coronavirus cases spread to more than 20 states and at least 300 people â?including to revelers' families and co-workers.
Bike Week typically draws almost half a million people to the Daytona Beach area each year. But because of the coronavirus pandemic, the numbers are estimated to be lower this year â?closer to 300,000 people, said Janet Kersey, the executive vice president and chief operating officer of the Daytona Regional Chamber of Commerce.
âThis year we know because of continued Covid concerns and the loss of income many have had over this past year it will be less,â?she said, adding that good weather and the accelerating pace of vaccinations could cause that number to rise.
âWhile our community is working hard to follow C.D.C. safety guidelines, the support of the visitors and participants is important in these efforts as well for everyone's safety,â?she said.
At least 125 new coronavirus deaths and 4,426 new cases were reported in Florida on Tuesday, according to a New York Times database of Covid-19 infections and deaths. Over the past week, there has been an average of 4,948 cases per day in the state, a decrease of 16 percent from the average two weeks earlier.
A more contagious and potentially more lethal variant of the coronavirus, known as B.1.1.7, which was first spotted in Britain, is spreading more widely in Florida as a share of total cases than in any other state, according to an analysis of data from Helix, a lab testing company.
With this year's event, which began on March 5 and runs through Sunday, Bike Week is celebrating the 80th anniversary of a gathering that has been billed as one of the largest motorcycle rallies in the country.
Events include races, bike exhibitions, concerts and giveaways in and around Daytona Beach, a popular Florida tourist area known for its hard-packed sand.
Ms. Kersey said that because of the pandemic, officials had considered canceling the event but said the Daytona Beach City Council was âvery meticulous in its decision to move forward.â?The city announced changes that were being made to help prevent the spread of Covid-19 during the rally.
They include limited curbside parking on Main Street, a popular strip of bars and restaurants by the beach, âto allow for proper physical distancing.â?Ms. Kersey said that the city had also added a motorcycles-only traffic areaon Main Street for this year's event.
Some businesses will be limited to 60 percent capacity, and merchants must follow guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for mask use and physical distancing, the city said.
Daytona Beach is in Volusia County, which is promoting a âWash Up Back Up Mask Upâ?campaign on posters, billboards and signs, in an official pocket guide and on the Bike Week website âto help spread the word and encourage safety,â?Ms. Kersey said.
Florida does not have a mask mandate and visitors are not required to quarantine upon arrival. The state has allowed restaurants and bars to operate at full capacity since September.
A Daytona Beach police spokesman, Messod Bendayan, said that on the first day of the rally, he did not see many bikers wearing masks on Main Street and did not think much had changed.
âIf I saw five masks in the crowd, that would have been too much,â?he said. âIt looked about like any other year.â?Mr. Bendayan said police officers were also taking some precautions for the duration of the rally.
âThe main one being limiting the number of officers physically responding to calls,â?he said on Wednesday, adding that âwe're using drones to surveil crowds from above and respond physically if we see anything that requires our response.â?Some business owners said they appreciated the return of Bike Week.
Bobby Honeycutt, the owner of Froggy's Saloon on Main Street, said he would follow the 60 percent indoor capacity rule.
âI got 32 cameras,â?he told WESH-TV. âI can see what's happening with the crowd. I can see if we're getting overstuffed, but I also got people walking around. If it becomes an issue, they will stop people from coming in.â?On the Bike Week Facebook page, visitors and fans said they were excited for the rally, but some urged attendees to take precautions. One woman, for instance, implored visitors to wear a mask and to âbe safe out there.â?Several worried that Bike Week would become the latest coronavirus superspreader event. A video posted on the Facebook page showed people walking and riding motorcycles near Main Street, some wearing masks and many going without.

Good morning.
(This article is part of the California Today newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox.)
Last week, we introduced our ongoing series, Your Lead, where we answer readers' questions about how the pandemic is changing daily life in California.
Today we are tackling our first question: Why have face shields not yet caught on as an alternative to masks in California?
Lori Holt, a neuropsychologist in Encino, posed this question. Dr. Holt conducts in-office assessments on patients using plexiglass barriers, air purifiers and disinfectants to protect herself and her patients from Covid-19. However, her efforts to conduct an accurate assessment are often stymied by patients who come in wearing masks.
âOne of the thorniest issues we had to overcome involved the use of face coverings,â?she wrote in an email.
Dr. Holt evaluates patients using a battery of tests to gauge things like a patient's memory, attention and language. Face masks can sometimes muffle speech, posing communication challenges and potentially affecting the patient's comprehension of the tests.
âIf the patient doesn't fully understand even a word or two of a paragraph or a word list that I'm asking them to remember for a verbal memory test, the entire test is 'spoiled' and unusable,â?she said.
Dr. Holt has found that clear plastic face shields are a good alternative to masks for her patients, who can opt to wear their own masks or are given their own face shields that they can take home afterward.
âIt is much easier to test the patients when they wear the face shield,â?she said. âTheir speech is much more intelligible than when they wear a mask. Also, we can see the patient's face and thus do not lose critical data with respect to facial expression that can help us understand the patient's emotional state of mind.â?Dr. Holt wondered about the popularity of face shields because, she said, despite the shield casting a minor glare, it is so comfortable that she sometimes forgets to take it off at the end of the day.
John Anderson, who lives in Penn Valley, Calif., asked a similar question about face shields. Mr. Anderson is hearing-impaired and prefers that others use face shields so that he can read lips. During a recent health checkup, his doctor wore a mask and his wife wore a face shield. He read his wife's lips as she repeated the doctor's words.
Last week, Gov. Gavin Newsom ordered all Californians to wear face coverings, like cloth masks, when out in public. The state's Department of Public Health recommends wearing a plastic face shield with a cloth draped along the bottom only if the wearer has a medical condition that prevents them from wearing a cloth mask.
Face shields are also commonly used by front-line health workers, but more people are looking at face shields as an added layer of protection.
The Palo Alto Unified teachers' unionrequested that the district supply teacherswith face shields and other personal protective equipment when they return to school. And the state's Department of Education recommends that everyone on school campuses wear masks or face shields with a drape across the bottom when schools reopen.
My colleague Knvul Sheikh wrote about the use of face shields, which can be easily wiped down and reused. Face shields also have the benefit of stopping people from touching their faces, and can be easier and more comfortable than masks.
However, experts say face shields have limits to the amount of protection they can offer. They seem to be most effective in protecting against cough droplets for people in close range of one another. And droplets can seep in through the back and sides of a face shield, which is why draping a piece of cloth along the bottom is recommended. But their efficacy has not yet been widely studied. For now, face masks are the better option for most people.
Regardless, we may be seeing a lot more of them in the coming weeks.
The City of Long Beach issued a health order last month requiring servers in restaurants to wear both cloth masks and face shields when working. Los Angeles issued a similar order this month.
Because the face shields were cost prohibitive for some businesses, Long Beach began a free distribution program for face shields that it sourced from donations and from state and city resources. Last weekend, it distributed 4,800 shields in just a few hours.
Sandy Wedgeworth, the city's public health emergency management director, estimates that the city still had around 25,000 face shields that it planned to give away to restaurants, bars and salons in future distribution events.
âWe want them out there in the community. We want the folks that need them to have them,â?she said. âThey are no good to anyone sitting in boxes.â?Here's what else to know today

2020/6/26,Why Aren't Face Shields More Popular in California ? California Today,US,"THE TESTAMENTS, by Margaret Atwood. (Anchor, 448 pp., $16.95.) This Booker Prize-winning, spy-thriller sequel to ''The Handmaid's Tale'' takes place 15 years later and has three narrators: Offred's younger daughter, in Canada; her older daughter, in Gilead; and Aunt Lydia, the handmaids' warden. Our reviewer, Michiko Kakutani, described Atwood's storytelling as ''immersive'' and ''propulsive.''
SILVER, SWORD, AND STONE: Three Crucibles in the Latin American Story, by Marie Arana. (Simon & Schuster, 496 pp., $22.) The Peruvian-born Arana's ''illuminating,'' ''melancholy'' history of Latin America ''deserves a wide audience,'' our reviewer, Ãlvaro Enrigue, wrote. With its theme of repetition mirrored by its structure, problems ''recur like a difficult dream'' that instead of finishing ''begins again and again.'' 
  THE INSTITUTE, by Stephen King. (Gallery Books, 576 pp., $19.99.) ''Of all the cosmic menaces that King's heroes have battled,'' according to our reviewer, Laura Miller, the ''slow creep into inhumanity'' in this novel ''may be the most terrifying yet.'' Here, the people who torment innocent children -- separated from their parents and viewed as ''resources, like the children of migrants and other demonized minorities'' -- are ''much like you and me.''
  THE PATIENT'S CHECKLIST: 10 Simple Hospital Checklists to Keep You Safe, Sane, and Organized, by Elizabeth Bailey. (Hachette Go, 192 pp., $15.99.) Abigail Zuger, M.D., called this guide by a patient advocate, revised for our pandemic era, ''a godsend for concerned friends and relatives trying to rein in the chaos,'' when she reviewed it in The Times in 2012.
  YEAR OF THE MONKEY, by Patti Smith. (Vintage, 224 pp., $16.) Dreams dominate the National Book Award-winning singer-songwriter's third memoir, a travelogue set in 2016. As she ''zigzags'' around the country snapping photos, Smith shares what our reviewer, Ken Tucker, referred to as her ''quivering inner life during her 70th year.'' Ten new images and a new chapter have been added.
  A TERRIBLE THING TO WASTE: Environmental Racism and Its Assault on the American Mind, by Harriet A. Washington. (Little, Brown Spark, 384 pp., $17.99.) An award-winning science writer looks at the disproportionate exposure to pollution and blight -- from lead poisoning to industial waste -- faced by minority groups, with direct consequences for their success. The paperback features a new preface on Covid-19 risks.

2020/8/30,Paperback Row,Section BR; Column 0; Book Review Desk; Pg. 24,"It's unclear if the problem is worse this year but complaints are on the rise in parts of California.
Good morning.
(This article is part of the California Today newsletter. Sign up here to get it delivered to your inbox.)
Today we are have another installment of Your Lead, where we answer readers' questions about how the pandemic is changing daily life in California. Christine, a reader in Livermore, asked: What's the deal with the fireworks that are going off every night?
Marie Tae McDermott answered:
The booms and hisses that start at sundown and go well into the night have been a nightly fixture of my Los Angeles neighborhood since Memorial Day. When I let my dog outside to do his business every evening, the bangs, pops and fizzles send him scurrying back. On my local Nextdoor feed, neighbors complain about the toll caused by the constant barrage of booms: pets cowering under beds and the suffering of loved ones with post-traumatic stress disorder.
While it's unclear if the problem is worse this year than last, what's certain is that more people, perhaps suffering from frayed nerves or cabin fever, are filing complaints across the state. The Los Angeles Police Department said that complaints aboutillegal fireworks are up 170 percent this month compared to the same time period last year. The Alameda County Sheriff's Office has also reported receiving more complaints than usual.
My colleagues in New York City reported on the uptick in illegal firework use there, where the number of complaints increased from 21 in 2019 to over 1,700 so far this year.Â Conspiracy theorieshave surfaced to try to explain the increase, but experts say it's more likely that fireworks provide a release for millions of people who are bored and frustrated after months of sheltering in place. Shutdowns have also led to less noise pollution overall, so cacophonous booms may be more pronounced. Others say widespread cancellation of fireworks displays have caused the black market to be flooded with professional-grade inventory.
This year, Californians' frustration over illegal fireworks arrive in the midst of rapidly rising Covid-19 cases and a robust fire season.
Shane Brown, the public information officer for the Fresno Fire Department, told me he sees aerial fireworks shooting off every evening from his balcony in downtown Fresno. During his shifts driving a fire engine, he said he has responded to dozens of fires in the last few weeks that he says were likely caused by fireworks.
âWe are anticipating an incredibly busy Fourth of July here,â?said Mr. Brown. The 80 firefighters on duty each day are already stretched thin, adding pressure to what he describes as an unusually busy season. The total fire response for his department has been up 60 percent from last year, he said.
State-approved fireworks are legal in some parts of California. The State Fire Marshal deems certain types âsafe and saneâ?and some cities permit sales during specific time periods. If it projects off the ground or creates an explosion, however, it is most likely illegal, he said.
On Nextdoor, some of my neighbors said that while they were frustrated over the nightly noise, they would not call the police due to nationwide accusations of police brutality and they did not want to subject others to potentially unfair treatment. Others say that summer fireworks are traditionally a time when communities come together around the glow of sparklers, and that this year is no different.
However, illegal fireworks, like M-80s, which pack powerful explosives and pose a safety risk to users and bystanders, have been the focus of recent crackdowns.
Los Angeles City Attorney Mike Feuer announced a campaign last week to curb the sale of illegal fireworks online. âThe nightly onslaught of illegal fireworks we're experiencing needs to stop,â?he said in a statement.
Tips from citizens about the illegal sale of fireworks, which are often sold on social media, can sometimes lead to successful stings. Police in Irwindale recently seized 2,000 pounds of fireworks after someone tipped off police to search a home.
Mr. Brown urged people to think about their community before using fireworks this year. A spark from a single firework can ignite a pile of leaves that could send embers to the roof of someone's home.
âThis is a small sacrifice for one year to bypass the celebration,â?he said. âTo prevent what could be a catastrophic loss of life or even just a simple loss of property.â?Here's what else to know today

Now, a quick update on the coronavirus pandemic: Noting what was probably his last chance to reach residents before the July 4 holiday, Gov. Gavin Newsom of California on Thursday implored residents to refrain from gathering with people outside their household â?no matter how great the temptation â?and to wear masks.
âThe evidence is simply overwhelming,â?he said in a video news conference. âMasks keep Californians healthy.â?Mr. Newsom unveiled a new public awareness campaign about the importance of wearing masks, having alreadyordered people to wear them in most indoor â?and some outdoor â?public settings.
On Wednesday, he announced that he was establishing teams to work with local authorities. The governor again emphasized that $2.5 billion in pandemic aid will be reserved for counties that do their share of enforcement.
Nevertheless, he said, âit requires some level of personal responsibility.â?[Read more about the restrictions. | See a map of coronavirus cases by county in California.]

2020/7/3,Why Are Fireworks Going Off Every Night in California ? California Today,US,"In this lesson, students will explore how the mathematical concepts of exponential growth and exponential decay help to explain the spread and slowdown of the coronavirus.
Students in U.S. high schools can get free digital access to The New York Times until Sept. 1, 2021.
Lesson Overview
Featured article: âThe Math That Explains the End of the Pandemicâ?When the coronavirus came to the United States over a year ago, we developed a new mantra: âFlatten the curve.â?The goal was to stem the runaway exponential growth in infections, in that way preventing hospitals from becoming overrun.
With the development and uptake of highly effective Covid-19 vaccines, we are now beginning to see the mathematical cousin of exponential growth â?exponential decay â?take over Covid case trends. According to experts, this is welcome news. If all goes well, current trends may foreshadow the end of the pandemic.
In this lesson, you will use the mathematical concepts of exponential growth and exponential decay to explain the spread and slowdown of the coronavirus. Then, you will use these models to explore different end-of-pandemic scenarios and the potential to reach herd immunity.
Materials: The following resources are available for teachers and students.

    â?Questions with answers.(PDF)
Warm-Up
Look closely at the graph below, which is from a prior âWhat's Going On in This Graph?â?activity.
This tree diagram shows a potential coronavirus chain of transmission. Each dot represents an infected person. One infected person (the person at the top of the diagram) spreads the coronavirus to others, who then spread it to others and so on.
After looking closely at the graph above (or at this full-size image), answer these four questions. The questions are intended to build on one another, so try to answer them in order:
    â?What do you notice?
    â?What do you wonder?
    â?What impact does this have on you and your community?
    â?What's going on in this graph? Write a headline that captures the graph's main idea.
Math Activity #1: Exponential Growth and the Coronavirus Pandemic
To understand exponential growth, let's take a mathematical look at the tree diagram â?using the table below.
The tree diagram can help us model the number of new infections over time. Specifically, let's define each horizontal layer of dots as representing the number of new infections on a certain day.
The top layer, representing Day 0, depicts just one newly infected person (one dot). The next layer down, representing Day 1, depicts two newly infected people (two dots). The following layer, representing Day 2, depicts four newly infected people (four dots). Here's a visual that shows how we are defining the days:
We can begin to fill in our chart with the number of new infections each day, based on the number of dots within these first few days:
Go ahead and fill in the rest of the table, based on the diagram. Note: You may notice a pattern, which can save you a lot of time from counting!
Answer the following questions, about the diagram and the table:
    â?Fill in the blank with a number: In the diagram, each newly infected person spreads the disease to ___ new people the next day. Hint: How many lines come out from each dot?
    â?Look at the table. What mathematical pattern do you notice?
    â?Let's connect our prior observations. Explain how the infection patterns we see in the tree diagram give rise to the mathematical pattern we see in the table.
Repeated multiplication creates what we call exponential patterns. If you've learned about exponents before, this name should make some sense. Exponents represent repeated multiplication. For example:
When we repeatedly multiply by a number greater than 1, we observe exponential growth. To get a sense of what exponential growth looks like, we're going to visualize our table of values as a graph.
Treat the days as the x values and the number of new infections as the y values. Each horizontal row on the table represents a data value (an x-y coordinate pair). Graph these data values on the following x-y coordinate grid. After you graph the points, connect them using a curved line (not a straight line). Note: The first point is already graphed for you.
Respond to the following:
    â?Describe what happens to the number of new infections over time.
    â?Describe what happens to the rate of new infections over time.
    â?Hospitals have limited capacity and bed space. Using this graph, discuss why it was so important in the early stages of the pandemic to follow social distancing guidelines and âflatten the curve.â?One way to test the quality of a mathematical model is to compare it to available data. Below is a graphic of the world's coronavirus case count early in the pandemic (March 2020), using data from Our World in Data. In addition to the raw data (the black dots), we've fit an exponential growth mathematical model (the blue line).
    â?Do you believe an exponential growth model is appropriate for modeling the initial spread of Covid-19? Justify using the graphics above.
    â?The statistician George E. P. Box famously said, âAll models are wrong, but some are useful.â?Look at the model and the data. The model is not an exact fit to the data. Why do you think this is the case? Is the model still useful?
Math Activity #2: Exponential Decay and Ending the Pandemic
Read the featured article from the beginning through the following paragraph:
Every case of Covid-19 that is prevented cuts off transmission chains, which prevents many more cases down the line. That means the same precautions that reduce transmission enough to cause a big drop in case numbers when cases are high translate into a smaller decline when cases are low. And those changes add up over time. For example, reducing 1,000 cases by half each day would mean a reduction of 500 cases on Day 1 and 125 cases on Day 3 but only 31 cases on Day 5.
As people become vaccinated, they are less likely to catch and show symptoms of the virus. Think about the tree diagram from earlier. The vaccine effectively blocks severe infection pathways from person to person (it breaks the lines between dots). As more people are vaccinated, more pathways are blocked, and the spread of the virus begins to slow.
How much can the spread slow? The author poses an example in which the number of cases reduces by half each day. Mathematically, this can be written as:
Number of cases tomorrow = 0.5 * (Number of cases today)
Let's create a table of values. Start out with the following:
To find the number of active cases on Day 1, we can follow the formula and multiply the Day 0 total by 0.5. This is shown below:
Go ahead and continue the pattern to fill in the rest of the table. You may get decimal answers for some days. At each day, round your answer to the nearest whole number, before proceeding to the next day.
Again, we see repeated multiplication. This means we have another exponential pattern. However, because we are multiplying by a number less than 1, we now have exponential decay. The article visualizes exponential decay using this graphic:
Answer the following questions:
    â?In the table of values, how much did the number of cases fall from Day 0 to Day 1? How much did the number of cases fall from Day 5 to Day 6? Comment on any trend you notice.
    â?Think about the trend you mentioned above. Does the graph show a similar trend? Explain.
    â?The article says that âthe worst of the pandemic may be over sooner than you think.â?Assume people continue to get vaccinated and follow public health guidelines. Why does the exponential decay model indicate that the worst will be over âsoonerâ?than we think? Why wouldn't we have to wait awhile for the worst to pass?
As before, we can evaluate the quality of our model by comparing it to real data. Continue reading the article through the following paragraph:
This pattern has already emerged in the United States: It took only 22 days for daily cases to fall 100,000 from the Jan. 8 peak of around 250,000, but more than three times as long for daily cases to fall another 100,000.
Here is a graph from The New York Times's Covid-19 database that illustrates this trend (focus on January 2021 and onward):
Answer the following questions:
    â?The article says that case counts fell by 100,000 in 22 days. Afterward, it took three times as long for the cases to decline by another 100,000. Explain how this statement supports the exponential decay model.
    â?Find the part of the graph that corresponds with the author's statement (the January 2021 peak and afterward). Does this part of the graph look like exponential decay? Explain.
Math Activity #3: Counterfactuals
Continue reading the article until you reach the following graphic:
This graph displays an important concept in statistics and the sciences: counterfactuals. Whenever you think to yourself, âI wonder what would happen if â¦â?â?you're essentially constructing a counterfactual. A counterfactual is an alternate reality that would exist if you changed something about your world.
In the above case, the dashed line provides a counterfactual Covid-19 case scenario. In this counterfactual reality, we relax public health precautions âtoo soonâ?and break the exponential decay trend.
    â?With this graphic, the author is making an argument about Covid-19 restrictions. What counterfactual argument are they making? How can you tell?
    â?Imagine a counterfactual in which we started relaxing restrictions at an even earlier time, just as the cases began to trend downward. Would we see a larger or smaller gap between the solid line and the counterfactual? Why?
Going Further
Option 1: Exponential decay in some countries. Exponential growth in others.
Use the Learning Network lesson on the recent surge of coronavirus cases in India. Connect the lesson to this visualization (from Our World in Data) of Covid-19 case trends in both India and the United States. Where do you see exponential decay? Where do you see exponential growth? What makes case trends differ between countries?
Option 2: Will we reach herd immunity?
Read the article âReaching 'Herd Immunity' Is Unlikely in the U.S., Experts Now Believe.â?Reflect on the following questions: What does herd immunity have to do with exponential growth and decay? What would need to happen to reach herd immunity? What factors affect our ability to reach herd immunity? Why are some experts still hopeful, even if we don't quite reach herd immunity? You can also explore the topic visually with this âWhat's Going On in This Graph?â?activity.
Option 3: Explore the math of vaccine efficacy.
Use the Learning Network lesson on calculating vaccine efficacy with data from the main Pfizer trial. As you work through the lesson, you will use math, statistics and probability to get a practical sense of how the vaccine performed. (Spoiler: It did well.)
Option 4: Analyze vaccine hesitancy.
Explore the New York Times vaccination database to analyze vaccination rates in your community. Then, use this Learning Network lesson to learn about vaccine hesitancy and efforts to persuade vaccine skeptics.
This lesson was written by Dashiell Young-Saver, who is a high school statistics teacher and the founder of the site Skew The Script. Important contributions were made by Sharon Hessney, who writes the NYT Learning Network's weekly feature âWhat's Going On in This Graph?â?About Lesson of the Day

2021/5/14,The Math of Ending the Pandemic: Exponential Growth and Decay current events,LEARNING,"The vaccines are effective at preventing serious illness and death, but they are not a golden shield against the coronavirus.
A wedding in Oklahoma leads to 15 vaccinated guests becoming infected with the coronavirus. Raucous Fourth of July celebrations disperse the virus from Provincetown, Mass., to dozens of places across the country, sometimes carried by fully vaccinated celebrants.
As the Delta variant surges across the nation, reports of infections in vaccinated people have become increasingly frequent â?including, most recently, among at least six Texas Democrats, a White House aide and an aide to Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
The highly contagious variant, combined with a lagging vaccination campaign and the near absence of preventive restrictions, is fueling a rapid rise in cases in all states, and hospitalizations in nearly all of them. It now accounts for about 83 percent of infections diagnosed in the United States.
But as worrying as the trend may seem, breakthrough infections â?those occurring in vaccinated people â?are still relatively uncommon, experts said, and those that cause serious illness, hospitalization or death even more so. More than 97 percent of people hospitalized for Covid-19 are unvaccinated.
âThe takeaway message remains, if you're vaccinated, you are protected,â?said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York. âYou are not going to end up with severe disease, hospitalization or death.â?Reports of breakthrough infections should not be taken to mean that the vaccines do not work, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the Biden administration's top pandemic adviser, said on Thursday at a news briefing.
âBy no means does that mean that you're dealing with an unsuccessful vaccine,â?he said. âThe success of the vaccine is based on the prevention of illness.â?Still, vaccinated people can come down with infections, overwhelmingly asymptomatic or mild. That may come as a surprise to many vaccinated Americans, who often assume that they are completely shielded from the virus. And breakthrough infections raise the possibility, as yet unresolved, that vaccinated people may spread the virus to others.
Given the upwelling of virus across much of the country, some scientists say it is time for vaccinated people to consider wearing masks indoors and in crowded spaces like shopping malls or concert halls â?a recommendation that goes beyond current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends masking only for unvaccinated people.
The agency does not plan to change its guidelines unless there is a significant change in the science, said a federal official speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the matter.
The agency's guidance already gives local leaders latitude to adjust their policies based on rates of transmission in their communities, he added. Citing the rise of the Delta variant, health officials in several California jurisdictions are already urging a return to indoor masking; Los Angeles County is requiring it.
âSeatbelts reduce risk, but we still need to drive carefully,â?said Dr. Scott Dryden-Peterson, an infectious disease physician and epidemiologist at Brigham &amp; Women's Hospital in Boston. âWe're still trying to figure out what is 'drive carefully' in the Delta era, and what we should be doing.â?The uncertainty about Delta results in part from how it differs from previous versions of the coronavirus. Although its mode of transmission is the same â?it is inhaled, usually in indoor spaces â?Delta is thought to be about twice as contagious as the original virus.
Significantly, early evidence also suggests that people infected with the Delta variant may carry roughly a thousandfold more virus than those infected with the original virus. While that does not seem to mean that they get sicker, it does probably mean that they are more contagious and for longer.
Dose also matters: A vaccinated person exposed to a low dose of the coronavirus may never become infected, or not noticeably so. A vaccinated person exposed to extremely high viral loads of the Delta variant is more likely to find his or her immune defenses overwhelmed.
The problem grows worse as community transmission rates rise, because exposures in dose and number will increase. Vaccination rates in the country have stalled, with less than half of Americans fully immunized, giving the virus plenty of room to spread.
Unvaccinated people âare not, for the most part, taking precautions, and that's what's driving it for everybody,â?said Dr. Eric J. Rubin, the editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine. âWe're all susceptible to whatever anyone's behavior is in this epidemic.â?Dr. Gounder likened the amount of protection offered by the vaccines to a golf umbrella that keeps people dry in a rainstorm. âBut if you're out in a hurricane, you're still going to get wet,â?she said. âThat's kind of the situation that the Delta variant has created, where there's still a lot of community spread.â?For the average vaccinated person, a breakthrough infection is likely to be inconsequential, causing few to no symptoms. But there is concern among scientists that a few vaccinated people who become infected may go on to develop long Covid, a poorly understood constellation of symptoms that persists after the active infection is resolved.
Much has been made of Delta's ability to sidestep immune defenses. In fact, all of the existing vaccines seem able to prevent serious illness and death from the variant. In laboratory studies, Delta actually has proved to be a milder threat than Beta, the variant first identified in South Africa.
Whether a vaccinated person ever becomes infected may depend on how high antibodies spiked after vaccination, how potent those antibodies are against the variant, and whether the level of antibodies in the person's blood has waned since immunization.
In any case, immune defenses primed by the vaccines should recognize the virus soon after infection and destroy it before significant damage occurs.
âThat is what explains why people do get infected and why people don't get seriously ill,â?said Michel C. Nussenzweig, an immunologist at Rockefeller University in New York. âIt's nearly unavoidable, unless you're going to give people very frequent boosters.â?There is limited evidence beyond anecdotal reports to indicate whether breakthrough infections with the Delta variant are more common or more likely to fan out to other people. The C.D.C. has recorded about 5,500 hospitalizations and deaths in vaccinated people, but it is not tracking milder breakthrough infections.
Additional data is emerging from the Covid-19 Sports and Society Workgroup, a coalition of professional sports leagues that is working closely with the C.D.C. Sports teams in the group are testing more than 10,000 people at least daily and sequencing all infections, according to Dr. Robby Sikka, a physician who worked with the N.B.A.'s Minnesota Timberwolves.
Breakthrough infections in the leagues seem to be more common with the Delta variant than with Alpha, the variant first identified in Britain, he said. As would be predicted, the vaccines cut down the severity and duration of illness significantly, with players returning less than two weeks after becoming infected, compared with nearly three weeks earlier in the pandemic.
But while they are infected, the players carry very high amounts of virus for seven to 10 days, compared with two or three days in those infected with Alpha, Dr. Sikka said. Infected players are required to quarantine, so the project has not been able to track whether they spread the virus to others â?but it's likely that they would, he added.
âIf they're put just willy-nilly back into society, I think you're going to have spread from vaccinated individuals,â?he added. âThey don't even recognize they have Covid because they think they're vaccinated.â?Elyse Freitas was shocked to discover that 15 vaccinated people became infected at her wedding. Dr. Freitas, 34, a biologist at the University of Oklahoma, said she had been very cautious throughout the pandemic, and had already postponed her wedding once. But after much deliberation, she celebrated the wedding indoors on July 10. 
Based on the symptoms, Dr. Freitas believes that the initial infection was at a bachelorette party two days before the wedding, when a dozen vaccinated people went unmasked to bars in downtown Oklahoma City; seven of them later tested positive. Eventually, 17 guests at the wedding became infected, nearly all with mild symptoms.
âIn hindsight, I should have paid more attention to the vaccination rates in Oklahoma and the emergence of the Delta variant and adjusted my plans accordingly,â?she said.
An outbreak in Provincetown, Mass., illustrates how quickly a cluster can grow, given the right conditions. During its famed Fourth of July celebrations, the small town hosted more than 60,000 unmasked revelers, dancing and mingling in crowded bars and house parties.
The crowds this year were much larger than usual, said Adam Hunt, 55, an advertising executive who has lived in Provincetown part time for about 20 years. But the bars and clubs didn't open until they were allowed to, Mr. Hunt noted: âWe thought we were doing the right thing. We thought we were OK.â?Mr. Hunt did not become infected with the virus, but several of his vaccinated friends who had flown in from places as far as Hawaii and Alabama tested positive after their return. In all, the cluster has grown to at least 256 cases â?including 66 visitors from other states â?about two-thirds in vaccinated people.
âI did not expect that people who were vaccinated would be becoming positive at the rate that they were,â?said Steve Katsurinis, chair of the Provincetown Board of Health. Provincetown has moved swiftly to contain the outbreak, reinstating a mask advisory and stepping up testing. It is conducting 250 tests a day, compared with about eight a day before July 1, Mr. Katsurinis said.
Health officials should also help the public understand that vaccines are doing what they are supposed to â?preventing people from getting seriously ill, said Kristen Panthagani, a geneticist at Baylor College of Medicine who runs a blog explaining complex scientific concepts.
âVaccine efficacy isn't 100 percent â?it never is,â?she said. âWe shouldn't expect Covid vaccines to be perfect, either. That's too high an expectation.â?PHOTOS: Vaccines are still effective at preventing serious illness.

When a Nurse Becomes a Patient
By Theresa Brown
When Theresa Brown was diagnosed with breast cancer, she felt afraid and deeply sad at the idea of leaving her children without a mother. The news sent Brown into such a state of shock and confusion that, to this day, she does not remember sharing it with her husband. But Brown, an oncology and hospice nurse, experienced something else too â?an uncontrollable anger and occasional urge for violence toward those in the medical system she deemed insufficiently caring and responsive to her unfortunate circumstances.
In her new memoir, âHealing: When a Nurse Becomes a Patient,â?Brown describes her ire upon realizing that a receptionist in a medical office had gone home early, denying her the chance to schedule a biopsy immediately following an alarming mammogram. Of a second receptionist who offhandedly told Brown the person was gone for the day, she writes, âI wanted to punch her in the stomach and as she doubled over, gasping for breath, smash my fist into the bridge of her nose. I wanted to hear bone crack. I wanted to see blood, have her say NO, beg for mercy.â?The day of Brown's lumpectomy, someone at the surgical center's front desk told her she was ânot on the listâ?of patients scheduled for operations that day. The person located Brown's name a few minutes later, but the thoughtless remark made Brown seethe. âI confess there is a part of me that wants to find that person again, back her up against a wall, get right in her face and bellow in the Nurse Voice, 'WHAT DO YOU MEAN I'M NOT ON THE LIST?'â?Brown later realized that her bursts of anger stemmed from a helplessness she felt over her disease, a desperation she failed to recognize often enough in her own patients in the oncology ward and as a home hospice nurse. This is the disconnect at the heart of âHealing.â?A caregiver receiving care suddenly understands an essential truth â?empathy is essential to alleviating suffering. âI had not understood that indifference can become a form of cruelty when one's life could be at stake.â?Unfortunately, Brown writes, âyou can't bill for empathy.â?The American health care system, in which each test, exam and drug are separate opportunities for revenue â?and often profit â?offers no tangible incentive for patience or kindness. We should not be surprised then that this kind of humanity is all too rare in medicine. Brown never realized the depth of this deficit or how maddening it could be for patients until she found herself on the other side.
Brown mines her time as a nurse for insights into the health care system's flaws, never shying away from her own shortcomings. In one unforgettable vignette drawn from her time on staff at a hospital, a 19-year-old cancer patient who is, understandably, cantankerous steps on a piece of IV detritus Brown had dropped on the floor. She writes, âHe was barefoot â?ouch â?and he swore elaborately.â?Eager to usher the patient and his scowling mother out of the hospital, Brown does not perform a dressing change; his mother says she will do it herself at home, but does not. A nursing manager later tells Brown she should have noted this in the patient's chart. âTruth is,â?writes Brown, âI never thought of it. After they left, I only wanted to be done with them. I had looked his anger right in the face, and then, as soon as I could, I looked away.â?In between her searing critiques, Brown offers glimpses of how things might go if only medical workers saw beyond the tasks at hand and had more time and fewer tasks to manage. The cheerful, accommodating staff in a radiation oncology unit made Brown feel welcome: âThey knew the value of kindness.â?Brown writes that universal health care, improved electronic health record-keeping and a fully nonprofit system are what's needed to create space and time for more compassion in American medicine. However, at less than a single page, Brown's prescription for improvement is so brief as to be unconvincing. While her prose is easy to understand, the multitude and length of the chapters in âHealingâ?â?39 in all, each two to eight pages â?can feel disjointed. At times, attempts to be clever fall short. Brown introduces a chapter about the cancer drug Tamoxifen, for example, by writing about her father's love for a Scottish hat called a tam. A chapter explaining how hospices pronounce patients dead begins with a meditation on how to pronounce âpotatoâ?and âDes Moines.â?Brown, who survived her ordeal, left nursing to write and give speeches about health care full time. With her newly acquired 360-degree perspective on medical care, one can't help feeling disappointed that Brown, the nurse, is no longer walking the halls of a hospital or dashing from one hospice appointment to the next, ready to put her newfound wisdom to work for patients. Then again, even the most well-intentioned health care workers can only do so much, given that they are, Brown writes, stuck in a system âfocused on profits and squeezing every last bit of effort from staff who only want to do good.â?Kate Pickert is the author of âRadical: The Science, Culture and History of Breast Cancer in America.â?HEALING When a Nurse Becomes a Patient By Theresa Brown 272 pp. Algonquin. $27.95.

A brief history of the past four months in America: 
  Experts: Don't rush to reopen, this isn't over.
  Donald Trump: LIBERATE!
  Covid-19: Wheee!
  Trump officials: Here's our opposition research on Anthony Fauci.
  And we're now faced with an agonizing choice: Do we reopen schools, creating risks of a further viral explosion, or do we keep children home, with severe negative effects on their learning?
  None of this had to happen. Other countries stuck with their lockdowns long enough to reduce infections to rates much lower than those prevailing here; Covid-19 death rates per capita in the European Union are only a 10th those in the United States -- and falling -- while ours are rising fast. As a result, they're in a position to reopen schools fairly safely.
  And the experience of the Northeast, the first major epicenter of the U.S. pandemic, shows that we could have achieved something similar here. Death rates are way down, although still higher than in Europe; on Saturday, for the first time since March, New York City reported zero Covid-19 deaths.
  Would a longer lockdown have been economically sustainable? Yes.
  It's true that strong social distancing requirements led to high unemployment and hurt many businesses. But even America, with its ramshackle social safety net, was able to provide enough disaster relief -- don't call it stimulus! -- to protect most of its citizens from severe hardship.
  Thanks largely to expanded unemployment benefits, poverty didn't soar during the lockdown. By some measures it may even have gone down.
  True, there were holes in that safety net, and many people did suffer. But we could have patched those holes. Yes, emergency relief costs a lot of money, but we can afford it: The federal government has been borrowing huge sums, but interest rates have remained near historical lows.
  Put it this way: At its most severe, the lockdown seems to have reduced G.D.P. by a little over 10 percent. During World War II, America spent more than 30 percent of G.D.P. on defense, for more than three years. Why couldn't we absorb a much smaller cost for a few months?
  So doing what was necessary to bring the coronavirus under control would have been annoying, but entirely feasible.
  But that was the road not taken. Instead, many states not only rushed to reopen, they reopened stupidly. Instead of being treated as a cheap, effective way to fight contagion, face masks became a front in the culture war. Activities that posed an obvious risk of feeding the pandemic went unchecked: Large gatherings were permitted, bars reopened.
  And the cost of those parties and open bars extends beyond the thousands of Americans who will be killed or suffer permanent health damage as a result of Covid-19's resurgence. The botched reopening has also endangered something that, unlike drinking in groups, can't be suspended without doing long-run damage: in-person education.
  Some activities hold up fairly well when moved online. I suspect that there will be a lot fewer people flying cross-country to stare at PowerPoints than there were pre-Covid, even once we finally beat this virus.
  Education isn't one of those activities. We now have overwhelming confirmation of something we already suspected: For many, perhaps most students there is no substitute for actually being in a classroom.
  But rooms full of students are potential Petri dishes, even if the young are less likely to die from Covid-19 than the old. Other countries have managed to reopen schools relatively safely -- but they did so with much lower infection rates than currently prevail in America, and with adequate testing, which we still don't have in many hot spots.
  So we're now facing a terrible, unnecessary dilemma. If we reopen in-person education, we risk feeding an out-of-control pandemic. If we don't, we impair the development of millions of American students, inflicting long-term damage on their lives and careers.
  And the reason we're in this position is that states, cheered on by the Trump administration, rushed to allow large parties and reopen bars. In a real sense America drank away its children's future.
  Now what? At this point there are probably as many infected Americans as there were in March. So what we should be doing is admitting that we blew it, and doing a severe lockdown all over again -- and this time listening to the experts before reopening. Unfortunately, it's now too late to avoid disrupting education, but the sooner we deal with this the sooner we can get our society back on track.
  But we don't have the kind of leaders we need. Instead, we have the likes of Donald Trump and Ron DeSantis, Florida's governor, politicians who refuse to listen to experts and never admit having been wrong.
  So while there have been a few grudging policy adjustments, the main response we're seeing to colossal policy failure is a hysterical attempt to shift the blame. Some officials are trying to blacken Dr. Fauci's reputation; others are diving into unhinged conspiracy theories.
  As a result, the outlook is grim. This pandemic is going to get worse before it gets better, and the nation will suffer permanent damage.

2020/7/14,America Drank Away Its Children's Future,OPINION,"By the time Doug Raysby's wife was allowed to enter his hospital room, it was too late to be sure whether he even knew she was there. After a feverish fight with the coronavirus, he lay unconscious on the bed. His wife cried through an N95 mask, while a computer tablet flashed a video stream of his children saying goodbye.
For weeks, as coronavirus cases spiked across the United States, deaths rose far more slowly, staying significantly lower than in the early, deadliest weeks of the nation's outbreak in the spring. New treatments, many hoped, might slow a new wave of funerals.
But now, signs are shifting: More than 1,000 Americans are dying of the coronavirus every day on average, a 50 percent increase in the last month. Iowa, Minnesota, New Mexico, Tennessee and Wisconsin have recorded more deaths over the last seven days than in any other week of the pandemic. Twice this past week, there have been more than 1,400 deaths reported in a single day.
âIt's getting bad and it's potentially going to get a lot worse,â?said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. âThe months ahead are looking quite horrifying.â?For families like Mr. Raysby's, the pain of personal loss has combined with a sense of anger that the nation, exhausted after nine months of the pandemic, has grown inured to the death toll, even as its pace is now quickening once more.
âDo you see this human being? Do you realize?â?said Kathy James, the mother-in-law of Mr. Raysby, a 57-year-old factory supervisor in Sioux Falls, S.D., who liked to hunt pheasants on the weekends. In the weeks since Mr. Raysby died of the virus, Ms. James said she had wanted to wave a photo of him â?a quiet, bespectacled man who once wooed her daughter with purple roses â?at the world.
âDo you see Doug?â?she said. âBecause he should be alive and he should be with us right now.â?More than 244,000 people have died from the coronavirus in the United States, more than any other country, and experts say the pace of new deaths is likely to accelerate in the coming weeks.
Deaths lag several weeks behind infections, so the toll being recorded now reflects transmission that happened several weeks ago, before the country began logging more than 140,000 new cases per day and hospitalizations reached their highest levels of the pandemic. On Friday, public health officials reported more than 181,000 new cases across the country, more than ever before.
The country remains far below the death toll of the spring, when as many as 2,200 people were perishing each day, but some estimates suggest that the United States may soon be on track to reach or even exceed those levels.
From the Midwest to the Sun Belt, officials are bracing for a mounting death toll.
In Marathon County, Wis., a sprawling community in the grip of a Covid-19 surge, a refrigerated morgue truck is now cooled and ready in case it is needed. The medical examiner's office has stocked extra body bags. A smaller, walk-in cooler was also brought in.
Two hours southeast, in Fond du Lac County, Wis., Dr. Adam Covach, the chief medical examiner, said the system had been strained by the uptick in deaths. Funeral homes are exceedingly busy. Dr. Covach has looked at his own storage capacity and wondered: How soon could his office be overwhelmed? âIf things continue increasing at the rate they're going, it's going to start getting pretty scary pretty fast,â?he said.
In El Paso, there have been so many coronavirus deaths in recent days that the county medical examiner parked five mobile morgue units â?the size of trucks â?outside its doors. Legacy Mortuary Service, a company that transports bodies from hospitals to funeral homes, is busier than ever, carrying 40 to 50 bodies most days now, its owner, Pilar Contreras, said.
German Alvarado said he had to wait nearly two weeks to hold a funeral for his father-in-law, Antonio Sierra Macias, a professional mechanic who died of the virus.
Mr. Alvarado said his wife and three children under the age of 12 first showed symptoms, then he got it, too. By mid-October, Mr. Sierra Macias also fell sick and was admitted to a hospital, where he learned he had diabetes, in addition to high blood pressure.
Things seemed to be improving, but Mr. Sierra Macias took a turn for the worse. He was 49.
Mr. Alvarado said it was difficult to contend with such loss even as people around him seemed not to be taking the virus seriously, believing it was being overhyped or thinking, somehow, that it was not dangerous.
âIt seems like people think the news are overthinking, overtalking,â?said Mr. Alvarado, who said he was waiting for paperwork to send his father-in-law's body for burial in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, Mexico, where cemeteries are running out of room. âYou don't realize the situation until you live through it.â?Improved medical treatments for the virus have emerged in the months since it first arrived in the United States, offering hope that even if cases soared before a vaccine was available, deaths might be held off.
A steroid, dexamethasone, has been shown to help the seriously ill; a new antibody treatment, similar to a therapy given to President Trump shortly after he contracted the coronavirus, just won emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration; and doctors now know to turn patients on their stomachs to improve oxygen flow, one of the many best practices that have emerged over months of contending with Covid-19. The case fatality rate â?a crude measure that looks at the share of people who die out of those who are known to have tested positive â?has fallen throughout the pandemic, according to public health experts.  That is in part because the country is conducting far more tests, and also because the age demographics have changed, with more cases among young people, who are less likely to get seriously ill.
Still, hospitals are now filling with patients, threatening the limits of medical systems in some regions. More than 68,000 people are in the hospital with the virus, greater than two earlier peaks in the spring and summer. Even the best medicines and techniques lose their usefulness if too many people get sick at the same time, taxing staffing and supplies.
âWhen you've overwhelmed the health care system, nobody is going to get optimal care,â?said Dr. Jessica Justman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University.
The rising case numbers â?and the threat of mounting deaths â?have led some experts to call for a coordinated national shutdown for four to six weeks. Other experts have advocated for a combination of masks, increased testing, paid support for people in quarantine and targeted shutdowns focused on high-risk indoor spaces as a way to slow the toll.
âWe can expect the case and death count to continue to rise exponentially unless we take serious measures to mitigate the virus,â?said Dr. Howard Markel, a historian of epidemics at the University of Michigan. âAll of this is terrible news.â?But with no announcements from the White House for new measures to respond to the soaring outbreak, most of the country is open for business, even as a few governors began calling for new restrictions on Friday.
Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico issued the most sweeping statewide mandate this fall, returning to a âstay at homeâ?order on Monday that will last two weeks. In Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown plans to put the state in a partial lockdown for two weeks starting Wednesday, shuttering gyms, halting restaurant dining and mandating that social gatherings have no more than six people.
A visibly angry Gov. Mark Gordon of Wyoming, speaking at a news conference, said that hospitals have set up tents because they are overrun, that patients from crowded facilities in South Dakota have been sent into Wyoming, and that misinformation about the virus was running rampant. He said he was considering a mask mandate and other restrictions after months of hesitation. People in Wyoming have been âknuckleheadsâ?about the virus, he said.
âWe've relied on people to be responsible and they're being irresponsible,â?Mr. Gordon said. âIf I can't rely on you, we're going to have to do something else.â?Particularly painful to those who are part of a growing group who have lost relatives is a sense of indifference about the outbreak, they say, by the public.
The family of Tagan Drone, a 5-year-old girl with a toothy smile and big, colorful bows in her hair, said she had just started kindergarten in Amarillo, Texas. She loved Peppa Pig, nail polish and everything purple and pink. She was learning how to spell her name. For Halloween, she was going to dress up as a mermaid.
But a few days before, she grew sluggish and started throwing up. Her mother took her to get medical treatment, where her family says she tested positive for the coronavirus.
Tagan's parents offered her soup and ginger ale for dinner, and gave her a bath before bed. Hours later, they found her unresponsive.
Children rarely need to be hospitalized with the virus, and very few die, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. No autopsy was conducted, her parents say, but Amarillo city officials said she was one of two young people in the area whose deaths have been attributed to Covid-19.
âIt's traumatizing,â?her father, Quincy Drone, 30, said, speaking from a hotel room where he and Tagan's mother, Lastassija White, have been staying because they cannot bear to return home, where Tagan used to swing from her bed like on monkey bars. They watched numbly as families they knew went trick-or-treating on Halloween, and as other children filed into school in their neighborhood.
âIt scared our community, but it scared them for maybe 12 to 20 hours and then everybody went back to normal life,â?Mr. Drone said. âAnd that's really how the world is.â?Mitch Smith contributed reporting.

2020/11/14,'It's Traumatizing': Coronavirus Deaths Are Climbing Once Again,US,"An unusual number of deep-sea denizens washed up last year on Southern California's beaches.
One morning in May, a fisherman happened upon an unsightly creature washed up on a beach in Southern California: Mouth agape, it had needlelike teeth, slick black skin and a bulbous appendage protruding from its head.
Several months later, another just like it beached itself in San Diego. Then came the third.
âI was like, 'Oh my gosh, another one?'â?said Ben Frable, a collection manager at Scripps Institution of Oceanography in San Diego, and now, the custodian of one of the creatures: a rare species of anglerfish, known as the Pacific footballfish.
He added, âIt was pretty exciting.â?The fish â?which live thousands of feet beneath the ocean in near-total darkness and freezing conditions â?are rarely seen by humans. The first was discovered in the early 1900s. Since then, 31 specimens have been collected worldwide, two of them last year in California. (The third was photographed but, before scientists could collect it, washed back out to sea.)
This year is âa good year for footballfish,â?Frable told me. âAt least for us encountering them, maybe not for them â?they are deceased.â?The last collected in California was 20 years ago, he added.
Pacific footballfish are flabby, slow and poor swimmers. The female lures her prey using a bioluminescent appendage that hangs like a lantern in front of her jaws. (The largest female ever found was 18 inches long. The males are a small fraction of that size.)
But much remains unknown about these bizarre deep-sea creatures, including why three washed up last year on California's beaches.
Scientists say it could be because of an especially good breeding season or unusual ocean currents and temperatures. Or perhaps, Frable said, it's just âserendipitous.â?The beachings are probably not the result of the oil spill off the coast of Southern California in October, or any kind of sonic boom or other freak occurrence, he added. In those instances, many marine organisms would wash ashore, not just a couple of fish.
âIt is an interesting phenomenon, but we're not alarmed,â?said Todd Clardy, the collections manager of ichthyology at the National History Museum of Los Angeles County, where the fish discovered in May is now preserved. He added, âWe are thrilled that we could get one.â?For now, California's ichthyologists are waiting, breath bated, to see whether more of the deep-sea denizens will wash ashore.
âWhen these types of things happen, I just think it has more people paying attention,â?Frable told me. âThe scale of diversity of life on the planet is kind of out of the bounds of what we generally conceive,â?he added.
âThere are still these mysteries out there.â?For more:

2022/1/6,Why Are Freakish Fish Washing Ashore in California ? California Today,US,"Monday: Applause for the stimulus deal is muted and the governor is back in quarantine, but another vaccine is expected today.
Good morning.
Today is the winter solstice, the darkest day of 2020. With California hospitals inundated and infections and deaths surging, is it too soon to hope for a sliver of dawn?
Congressional leaders reached a deal on a $900 billion coronavirus relief package with stimulus checks worth $600 per person. Also, a Centers for Disease Control panel set the stage for the next vaccine rollouts, prioritizing people over 74 and essential workers.
Cheers here were muted. An off-campus housing coordinator at Humboldt State University told my colleagues Carly Stern and Nicholas Bogel-Burroughs that a $600 check â?about half of what the government sent out in April â?would be âa jokeâ?in high-cost Northern California. Nor did the package include money for state or local governments, quashing hopes that California cities might avoid deep budget cuts.
Meanwhile, withinfections at supermarkets soaring in Los Angeles County, a doctor at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center told The Los Angeles Times that one rich patient suggested a $25,000 donation in exchange for vaccination ahead of essential workers. And health care workers at Stanford Medical Center protested after a vaccine plan there left out medical residents and fellows.
Still, the Moderna vaccine arrives this week, even as Gov. Gavin Newsomquarantines again (a staffer tested positive for the virus). âWhile California is in some of the darkest days of our COVID-19 surge, with too many families grieving lost loved ones,â?Mr. Newsom said in a statement, âthere is light as more vaccines are approved.â?(This article is part of the California Today newsletter.

And Finally â?Years ago, at an autograph show in Burbank, I interviewed Paul Reubens, the actor better known as the pop cultural icon Pee-wee Herman. Months later, I received the funniest Christmas card I've ever gotten, signed by both of them.
Since then, every December, a card has landed in my mailbox â?my real mailbox, not my email â?always featuring some wacky holiday tableau, always wishing me joy and always signed by Mr. Reubens and âyour pal, Pee-wee Herman.â?I save those cards. And I'd share the latest, but this year, it had a preprinted footnote. âI greatly appreciate you NOT posting this card,â?it said, which was surprising â?celebrities usually regard holiday greetings as branding opportunities. So I called Mr. Reubens, whom I found at home in the Hollywood Hills last week, hiding out from the pandemic, working on a book, a cartoon show and other projects and feeling âextremely blessed to have the resources not to have to go out.â?Here's our chat, lightly edited:
Your holiday card is so great. Why the footnote?
My card is for people I know â?it's not for the internet. Somewhere around 3,000 people are on the mailing list. It's a little out of hand. I've been doing it since âPee-wee's Big Adventure,â?so, for like 35 years. But that being said, I'm going to remove anyone who posts it now. You can publish a prior card, but the less said the better about this year's.
Got it. How did your card get started?
I've just always liked Christmas cards. My first card, I put on my Pee-wee suit and I went to the Beverly Center in Los Angeles and had a friend take a picture of me with the mall Santa Claus. I waited in line. Once I did it, it became an annual thing. My second card was a still from âPee-wee's Big Adventure.â?There's a North Pole scene.
Do you design it yourself?
I've had a string of people I know, artists. Sometimes I have an idea, sometimes the artist has the idea. The guy who designed my original stage show, Gary Panter, designed some. He was the premier punk rock poster person in the '80s. The person doing them now designed a lot of the merchandise that was on the Pee-wee's Big Adventure 35th Anniversary tourI was recently on before Covid shut it down. She goes by A. Pants, like a pair of pants. She's in Florida.
Can people get onto your list?
Sometimes people I know will go, âMy niece or my grandkid or my friend would love to be on your list.â?Depending on who it is, if it's a really close friend, it's been known to happen. There are kids who, like, made a wish in the hospital, people like that. But generally, I don't have people on my Christmas card list I don't know. That's kind of been my rule of thumb.
But don't you do it for marketing?
You would think â?3,000 cards! But, no. It's just a way to say, I'm thinking of you. There are caregivers who took care of my mother and father from years ago. There's a teacher I really like. People way, way out of my past. But every year, I do it, even after 9/11. Even in the middle of Covid, I just sent it out early. By the way, I get an enormous number of Christmas cards back.
Are you ever political?
One year, the card was a mouse hole with a teeny-tiny portrait of the Obama family on the mouse's wall. But I'm on social media. I know better than to be political. I don't need that grief. I like to be the opposite of timely, whatever that is. Untimely! I don't want people to go, âOh, there's the Trump end-of-the-era card.â?I like that it's a real card.
It costs a fortune. There was a time when almost everyone I know switched to electronic cards. It was a real quandary. But my friend John Waters, the director, does a card. We don't really compete, but people tell me, âYou and John Waters have the best cards of anybody.â?A friend of mine called this year and said, âWho's your printer?â?And I said, âDon't you do an electronic card?â?And she said, âI did but you made me feel guilty, and then John Waters completely raked me over the coals, like, 'That's pathetic, don't send me your lame e-card.'â?Wait â?you're on John Waters's Christmas card list?
Oh yeah. I save his cards.

2020/12/21,A Covid Deal and Pee-wee's Christmas Card CALIFORNIA TODAY,US,"An informal gathering that swelled to as many as 800 people, most of whom were not wearing masks or social distancing, turned violent on Saturday, officials said.
BOULDER, Colo. â?A large gathering that turned into a melee near the University of Colorado Boulder on Saturday evening left multiple students bleeding and tear-gassed, at least two vehicles damaged and three SWAT officers injured, the police said.
The officers were hurt as they tried to disperse the crowd in the University Hill neighborhood of Boulder. The officers were hit with bricks and rocks and sustained minor injuries, the Boulder Police Department said on Twitter, and the windshield of an armored car deployed to the scene was shattered.
Over 100 people started running toward the officers before tear gas was used, the city's police chief, Maris Herold, said at a news conference on Sunday. The crowd was at its largest at about 7 p.m., involving as many as 800 people, the chief said.
Most of the attendees were not taking precautions against the coronavirus like social distancing or wearing masks. Infectious disease experts have raised concerns that as the weather warms and local restrictions ease, social gatherings and spring break trips could cause a surge in coronavirus cases.
The Boulder County district attorney, Michael T. Dougherty, said the episode was a âtremendous setbackâ?in the city's efforts to fight the pandemic. Jeff Zayach, the county's public health director, called the lack of mask-wearing and social distancing âshocking and disturbing.â?Colorado recently reached 6,000 deaths from Covid-19, according to a New York Times database.
The university said it was âaware of a large party on University Hill on Saturday evening and allegations of violence toward police officers responding to the scene.â?âWe condemn this conduct,â?it said, adding that âit is unacceptable and irresponsible particularly in light of the volume of training, communication and enforcementâ?about coronavirus restrictions.
The neighborhood, known as the Hill, is home to bars and many of the university's fraternity and sorority houses. Anna Haynes, the editor in chief of the CU Independent, a student-run news site, wrote in The New York Times last year, âIt's the place you go to party, pandemic or not.â?Students who live in the neighborhood said people were having small gatherings in their yards on Saturday to enjoy a warm day after having been cooped up by the cold weather and coronavirus restrictions.
But as videos of the scene were posted on social media, people who didn't live there or were unaffiliated with the university, such as high school students, began gathering in the street.
Though it was clear not every person was a student at the university, âwe're not going to try to shift the blame,â?Pat O'Rourke, the university's chief operating officer, said.
Brynn Umansky, a junior at the university who lives in the University Hill neighborhood, said that âas soon as it turned dark, it turned into a whole mob and it literally kept growing over the night until the cops came.â?âIt was really scary and awful and the police didn't do anything for hours,â?she said. âIt was a lot, especially living right here and seeing all of it and not being able to do anything about it.â?Ms. Umansky and her roommates watched the scene unfold from their balcony as people climbed onto their roof and tried to enter. Kendall St. Claire, a junior who lives with Ms. Umansky, said that attendees hurled bottles and rocks at police cars, injuring people in the process.
Those injured âwere just coming into our house and we couldn't stop them,â?Ms. St. Claire said, adding that most of them were severely intoxicated. âAt least three people I had seen had gashes in the middle of their forehead,â?she said.
Isabella Sackheim was at Ms. Umanksy's house when someone told her that her car, a silver Nissan Versa, had been rolled over.
âPeople were cheering,â?Ms. Umansky said. âIt was horrible. It was mob mentality, for sure.â?The police received calls shortly before 5 p.m. about âa large partyâ?on the block, the city said. At 5:40 p.m. âthe crowd swelled and individuals began pelting the officers with glass bottles,â?according to the city, and at 5:48 p.m. the Boulder Police Department activated its SWAT unit. It wasn't until 9 p.m. that the crowd began to disperse, the city said.
Ms. Sackheim said that the episode was âreally disappointing,â?but that she was encouraged by the university community's efforts to help her. One of Ms. Sackheim's friends set up a GoFundMe page, and someone posted her Venmo user name on social media, she said, raising $9,000 to replace her car.
At one point during the melee, people danced on an Amazon delivery truck, students said. A summons was issued to one of the people on the truck, the police chief said.
No arrests were made on Saturday, though some citations for violations of public health orders were issued earlier in the day, Chief Herold said. The department is reviewing body camera footage as well as photos and videos posted on social media to identify those involved, she said.
Frida Carlson, a senior, said she hoped the university would increase coronavirus testing and consider canceling in-person classes for two to three weeks over fears that the gathering might have been a superspreader event.
Mr. O'Rourke said that in-person classes would continue this week but that students could raise concerns with their professors. City and university officials have urged anyone at the gathering to quarantine for 10 days and to seek virus testing. Mr. O'Rourke said that students would not be identified or penalized for seeking testing.
âI'm sure there will be an outbreak,â?Ms. Umanksy said.

2021/3/7,Melee Near University of Colorado Boulder Injures 3 Officers,US,"GETTING everyone vaccinated in the United States has become much harder now that demand for the Covid-19 vaccine is flagging. America's vaccination strategy needs to change to address this, and it starts with understanding the specific reasons that people have not been vaccinated yet.
The conventional approach to understanding whether someone will get vaccinated is to ask people how likely they are to get the vaccine and then build a demographic profile based on their answers: Black, white, Latinx, Republican, Democrat. But this process isn't enough: Just knowing that Republicans are less likely to get vaccinated doesn't tell us how to get them vaccinated. It's more important to understand why people are still holding out, where those people live and how to reach them. 
  After conducting a national survey of U.S. adults, we grouped people into distinct profiles based on shared beliefs and barriers to getting the vaccine. This approach, borrowed from the marketing world, is called psychobehavioral segmentation. It will allow health officials to target their strategies in ways that ignore demographic categories, like age and race. We used this approach to identify four distinct personas of vaccine hesitant people: the Watchful, the Cost-Anxious, the System Distrusters and the Covid Skeptics. People in each segment share some beliefs and barriers about Covid-19 vaccination. And each persona includes at least some of every demographic: Republicans, Black people, the middle class, young people and others.
  Covid Skeptics
  Covid Skeptics are at the far end of the spectrum as the least likely to get vaccinated. The primary barriers for people in this group are their specific, deeply held beliefs about Covid-19. Everyone in this group believes at least one conspiracy theory related to the pandemic, whether it's that microchips are implanted with the Covid vaccine; that Covid-19 has been exploited by the government to control people; or that the pandemic was caused by a ring of people who secretly manipulate world events.
  We found Covid Skeptics are common in Arkansas, North Dakota and Nevada. Considering that 84 percent of this group believe that the government is exploiting Covid-19 to control people, leaders of vaccination campaigns should consider tapping nonpolitical figures to mobilize this group. Doctors are trusted by 50 percent of this group, while scientists are trusted by 32 percent. They could also use religious leaders, who may resonate best with 9 percent of group members who say the vaccine goes against their religious beliefs. The key to engaging this group will be to avoid trying to debunk what they believe; rather, experts need to listen, to acknowledge the group's feelings and then share the facts. Our research finds that emphasizing that vaccination is their own, personal choice -- one that can help them protect friends and family members -- can also work.
  System Distrusters
  The System Distrusters believe that the health care system doesn't treat them fairly. Most, but not all, members of this group are people of color, and they prevail in Washington, D.C., Maryland and Georgia.
  It will be important for public health officials to hold conversations -- formal or informal -- with trusted members of System Distrusters' communities to address concerns and be transparent about efforts to vaccinate underserved communities. People in this group have low expectations that other members of their communities will get vaccinated, so making vaccinations of people they know as visible as possible will be important. Illuminating efforts to ensure that the vaccine rollout is equitable and sharing that with the community is key.
  Cost-Anxious
  The Cost-Anxious worry about the time and potential expense of getting vaccinated (even if it is actually free). We learned they're dominant in states like Mississippi, where they make up 23 percent of the population, which is not surprising due to the state's high poverty rates and low Medicaid coverage.
  Public health experts have stressed the need to bring vaccines to the people; with no group is this truer than with the Cost-Anxious. Holding vaccination clinics in non-health-care locations that people frequent -- like workplaces, religious venues, day care centers, supermarkets, bars and restaurants -- will be critical.
  For this group, vaccination campaign leaders should stress that vaccination is totally free and encourage local businesses to provide paid time off for both doses.
  The Watchful
  The Watchful are holding out to see what kind of experience their friends or neighbors have with the vaccine before committing themselves. They dominate in Delaware, making up 17 percent of the state's population, as well as 12 percent in Hawaii and Rhode Island.
  Behavioral science researchers know that establishing norms can lead to the acceptance of products and could help persuade the Watchful. Encouraging those who are vaccinated to show their vaccination status with pride, both online and offline, can nudge their family, friends and networks to follow suit. The Watchful are already likely to wear masks, showing an intent to comply with social norms, so they may respond to altruistic messages about vaccination and get vaccinated to protect others.
  For this group, experts should consider allowing for a ''vaccinate later'' option. Behavioral science suggests that people prefer moderate or ''compromise'' options over their extreme counterparts. Being able to opt-in to vaccines down the road may provide a comfortable alternative for this group.
  President Biden's goal to have 70 percent of the population vaccinated by the Fourth of July will be tough to meet without understanding what drives lower vaccine confidence and where various strategies to combat it will be most effective. And we can't stop at the state level; we need to go county by county and ZIP code by ZIP code, offering specific, localized solutions to persuade the holdouts. It will also be important that all people -- not just the health care professionals and the politicians -- do their part. It won't be easy, but it must be done to ensure that more people get vaccinated.Sema K.

2021/5/22,Those Holding Us Back From Full Vaccination,Section A; Column 0; Editorial Desk; Pg. 23,"Vaccinated residents who had embraced a return to some normalcy are unsettled: ''It's scary -- it feels like we've been here before.''
Holiday plans abruptly reversing, restaurants closing, Broadway shows going dark while, blocks away, long lines form outside testing sites -- it's as if it were 2020 all over again. 
  The startling rise in coronavirus infections has whiplashed New York City and the surrounding region. Once more, most everyone seems to know someone who is infected.
  Millions of people who have followed the city's guidelines and received two or even three vaccination shots, who have in recent weeks and months enjoyed a return to many of their old practices -- riding the subway, dining indoors, partying with friends -- face an uncertain future.
  ''It's scary -- it feels like we've been here before,'' said Emma Clippinger, 36, waiting in a long line outside a testing site in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, on Thursday. ''It feels like last year, last winter, despite the vaccines and despite the boosters, and it's the same game plan, but it also feels like we get defeated often.''
  New York City and the surrounding Northeast, the epicenter of the coronavirus's arrival in 2020, is being buffeted by a new surge in infections that seems poised to disrupt the long awaited return to normalcy. New case reports in New York State have skyrocketed nearly 60 percent in the last two weeks.
  ''It is clear that the Omicron variant is here in New York City in full force,'' Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday.
  Deidre Depke, 59, waiting in line for a test on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, didn't need the mayor to tell her. ''Monday I wasn't even thinking about it,'' she said, ''and Thursday I'm in a panic.''
  An average of more than 10,600 infections were being identified each day in New York State, more than any other state, and hospitalizations were also increasing, although more slowly. The city's test positivity rate doubled in just three days, up to 7.8 percent on Sunday compared with 3.9 percent the previous Thursday, raising alarm bells among city officials and residents alike.
  The number of new cases reported statewide on Thursday alone -- 18,276, more than 8,300 of them in New York City -- was the highest since at least January. Hospitalizations, though, remain at a fraction of what they were in the city's deadly first virus wave, with about 1,000 people hospitalized in New York City now, compared to more than 15,000 at the peak in April 2020.
  It remains unknown to what extent Omicron will cause serious illness. Scientists believe that vaccines will still provide protection against the worst outcomes, and boosters are likely to provide additional protection against infection, preliminary data suggests.
  The public health picture in other states was also growing bleaker. Connecticut is averaging more than 2,600 new cases a day, up from about 330 at the start of November, and Rhode Island is adding cases at the highest rate in the nation. Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania have the highest rates of coronavirus hospitalizations.
  In Rhode Island, Dr. Wilfredo Giordano-Perez, who sits on the governor's vaccine committee, said the number of people scaling back holiday plans still seemed fairly small. ''I wish I was hearing more of that,'' he said. ''I think people are going to take their chances, with this idea that they've done everything they can do up until this point.''
  In New York, Mayor de Blasio announced six steps to address the surge, including expanding the hours and capacity of testing sites, distributing one million free KN95 masks and 500,000 home tests through community organizations, stepping up enforcement of mask and vaccine mandates at businesses and encouraging more New Yorkers to get boosters.
  Only 1.5 million New Yorkers, or about 22 percent of adults, have gotten either a booster or an additional dose, according to city statistics. Meanwhile, 82 percent of adult New Yorkers are fully vaccinated.
  ''We have seen a very substantial increase in Covid cases in the last few days,'' Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday.
  ''People need to get vaccinated right now, get that booster right now,'' he added. ''If they are not feeling well, get tested right now. It's an urgent situation.''
  At-home testing kits, piled high just weeks ago with shoppers showing little interest, are selling out at some stores. The governor's office on Thursday announced plans to create a system for residents to request that coronavirus tests be sent to their homes.
  With a new year approaching, many corners of the city seemed to be sliding backward. Some restaurants have had to shut their doors, not because the city forced them to but because their staff members tested positive or were exposed to the virus, and there was no one to replace them.
  Many Broadway shows, so soon after their celebrated return in September, have once again gone dark for limited stretches, often with hours' notice, as cast or crew members test positive.
  New York University canceled all ''nonessential'' gatherings, from holiday parties to graduation ceremonies, and strongly advised that finals be moved online. Cornell University declared a Code Red on its Ithaca, N.Y., campus, after more than 900 community members tested positive in a week, despite near-perfect vaccination rates. Companies have called off everything from Midtown Manhattan holiday parties to return-to-office timetables and in-person meetings.
  Corporations including Citigroup and Apple are asking employees to work from home. JPMorgan Chase moved a January health care conference to online, while Goldman Sachs urged workers to cancel holiday parties.
  New rules affect everyone -- even the audiences for the Rockettes. The city will be sending inspectors to Radio City Music Hall and other venues to make sure that they are checking vaccination cards among children as young as 5, who need one dose of vaccine to attend indoor shows.
  Gov. Kathy Hochul addressed the matter at a news conference Thursday. ''We're asking people to follow common sense. Get vaccinated, get boosted. Please don't take a chance,'' she said. ''People have a right to stay alive, and the people that you affect have a right to live as well.''
  Even though data has suggested that the unvaccinated remain most at risk, that was little comfort to vaccinated New Yorkers, watching the plans they'd waited so long to make evaporate as even vaccinated people test positive in breakthrough cases.
  ''It's literally all I've been thinking about,'' said Sarah Gancher, a teacher at the New School, sitting in Madison Square Park with a bag of at-home testing kits she had just purchased. She said eight of her fully vaccinated friends had tested positive this week. ''I'm really heartsick and worried. This to me feels like the day Broadway shut down, again.''
  The old threat calculations surrounding family and friends are back: Do I go or do I stay home? Who else will be there, and are they at greater risk? Are they vaccinated -- and does that really matter?
  Ms. Clippinger's holiday plans in the city, including her mother's visit from Boston, are shifting beneath her feet.
  ''My mom is probably going to make her visit very short, just to kiss everyone and then go back to her partner,'' she said. ''In the past it would have been museums and Broadway, and eating at all of our favorite restaurants -- not this year.''
  Meera Ilahi, 22, took a test on Thursday after several of her friends attended the raucous, generally maskless Santa Con bar crawl on Saturday -- even though she did not.
  ''I'm kind of nervous because a lot of people I know who went out this weekend are testing positive,'' she said as she waited to learn her own results. ''And then on TikTok, I've been scrolling and like, every video I kept getting was like, 'I am in New York, and I have Covid.'''
  The news brought to the fore familiar insecurities from the start of the pandemic. ''I'm worried about financial stress, mostly,'' said Tristan Ramirez, a 23-year-old Washington Heights resident waiting for a test at the subway station on 72nd and Broadway. ''If I get sick and have to take a lot of time off, I'm not going to get paid.''
  Vivienne Taylor, 62, a Queens resident, waited in a testing line hours before her scheduled flight to her hometown in Jamaica on Thursday evening. The airport and journey would be her last public outings for the time being, she said.
  ''I'm not going to be complacent,'' Ms. Taylor said. ''I'm going to go home, I'm going to stay home and just keep to myself.''
  The fatigue of the pandemic -- the worrying, then relief, then more worrying, and more masks -- reaches all the way to the governor's office, as Ms. Hochul made clear on Thursday. She was asked when it would all end, and she took a deep breath, rubbed her hands together and looked skyward before answering with a seemingly forced smile.
  ''There is no person on this earth who can give an answer to the question, 'When will this end?''' she said. ''Nor can I.''

2021/12/17,"For New York City , a Familiar Anxiety",Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1,"The effort reflects the continuing and evolving threat the coronavirus pandemic poses to the economic recovery.
WASHINGTON â?President Biden's aggressive move to expand the number of vaccinated Americans and halt the spread of the Delta variant is not just an effort to save lives. It is also an attempt to counter the continuing and evolving threat that the virus poses to the economy.
Delta's rise has been fueled in part by the inability of Mr. Biden and his administration to persuade millions of vaccine-refusing Americans to inoculate themselves against the virus. That has created another problem: a drag on the economic recovery. Real-time gauges of restaurant visits, airline travel and other services show consumers pulled back on some face-to-face spending in recent weeks.
After weeks of playing down the threat that a new wave of infections posed to the recovery, the president and his team blamed Delta for slowing job growth in August. âWe're in a tough stretch,â?he conceded on Thursday, after heralding the economic progress made under his administration so far this year, âand it could last for a while.â?The virus threatens the recovery even though consumers and business owners are not retrenching the way they did when the coronavirus began to spread in the United States in the spring of 2020. Far fewer states and cities have imposed restrictions on business activity than in previous waves, and administration officials vowed on Thursday that the nation would not return to âlockdowns or shutdowns.â?But a surge in deaths crippled consumer confidence in August and portends a possible chill in fall spending as people again opt for limited in-person commerce. The unchecked spread of the virus has also contributed to a rapid drop in the president's approval ratings â?even among Democrats.
The explosion of new cases and deaths also appears to have deterred many would-be workers from accepting open jobs in businesses across the country, economists say. That comes as businesses and consumers are complaining about a labor shortage and as administration officials pin their hopes on rising wages to power consumer spending in place of fading government support for distressed families.
The plan that Mr. Biden announced on Thursday would mandate vaccinations for federal employees and contractors and for millions of health care workers, along with new Labor Department rules requiring vaccines or weekly tests for employees at companies with more than 100 employees. It would push for more testing, offer more aid to small businesses, call on schools to adopt vaccine requirements and provide easy access to booster shots for eligible Americans. The president estimated the requirements would affect 100 million Americans, or about two-thirds of all workers.
âWe have the tools to combat the virus,â?he said, âif we can come together and use those tools.â?Mr. Biden faces political risks from his actions, which drew swift backlash from many conservative lawmakers who accused him of violating the Constitution and abusing his powers.
But administration officials have always viewed vaccinating more Americans as the primary strategy for reviving the recovery.
âThis is an economic downturn that has been spawned from a public health crisis,â?Cecilia Rouse, the chairwoman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, said last month in an interview. âSo we will get back to economic health when we get past the virus, when we return to public health as well.â?That is likely true even in places that already have high inoculation rates. Mr. Biden's inability thus far to break through vaccine hesitancy, particularly in conservative areas, has also become a psychological spending drag on those in highly vaccinated areas. That is because vaccinated Americans appear more likely to pull back on travel, dining out and other activity out of fear of the virus.
âPeople who vaccinate themselves very early are people who are already very careful,â?said JesÃºs FernÃ¡ndez-Villaverde, a University of Pennsylvania economist who has studied the interplay between the pandemic and the economy. âPeople who do not vaccinate themselves are less careful. So there is a multiplier effectâ?when it comes to those kinds of decisions.
The economic effect from the virus varies by region, and it has changed in key ways over the course of the pandemic. In some heavily vaccinated parts of the country â?including liberal states packed with Mr. Biden's supporters â?virus-wary Americans have pulled back on economic activity, even though infection rates in their areas are low. In some less-vaccinated states like Texas that have experienced a large Delta wave, data suggest rising hospitalization and death rates are not driving down activity as much as they did in previous waves.
âIt appears the latest Covid surge has been less impactful on the economy than previous surges in Texas,â?said Laila Assanie, a senior business economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which surveys employers in the state each month about their activity during the pandemic.
Business owners, Ms. Assanie said, âsaid they were better prepared this time around.â?Respondents to the survey said consumer spending had not fallen off as much this summer, compared with the initial spread of the coronavirus in March 2020 or a renewed spike last winter, even as case and hospitalization rates neared their previous peak from January. But many employers reported staffing pressures from workers falling ill with the virus. The share of businesses reporting that concerns about the pandemic were an impediment to hiring workers tripled from July to August.
Data from Homebase, which provides time-management software to small businesses, show that employment in entertainment, dining and other coronavirus-sensitive sectors has fallen in recent weeks as the Delta variant has spread. But the decline is smaller than during the spike in cases last winter, suggesting that economic activity has become less sensitive to the pandemic over time. Other measures likewise show that economic activity has slowed but not collapsed as cases have risen.
That trend has helped bolster overall consumer spending and hiring in the short term and helped keep the economy on track for its fastest annual growth in a quarter century. But there is a risk that it will be undercut by a continued pandemic dampening of labor force participation. Economists who have tracked the issue say that even if consumers have grown more accustomed to shopping or dining out as cases rise, there is little sign that would-be workers, even vaccinated ones, have become more accepting of the risks of returning to service jobs as the pandemic rages.
âIt's becoming increasingly clear that employers are eager to hire,â?said Andrew Atkeson, an economist at the University of California at Los Angeles who has released several papers on the economics of the pandemic. âThe problem is not that people aren't spending. It's that people are still reluctant to go back to workâ?The Delta wave also appears to be sidelining some workers by disrupting child care and, in some cases, schools â?forcing parents to take time off or to delay returning to jobs.
Some forecasters believe the combination of rising vaccination rates and a growing share of Americans who have already contracted the virus will soon arrest the Delta wave and set the economy back on track for rapid growth, with small-business hiring and restaurant visits rebounding as soon as the end of this month. âNow is the time to start thinking about the post-Delta world,â?Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a research note this month.
Other economists see the possibility that a continued Delta wave â?or a surge from another variant in the months to come â?will substantially slow the recovery, because potential workers in particular remain sensitive to the spread of the virus.
âThat's a very real danger,â?said Austan Goolsbee, a former head of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama whose research earlier in the pandemic showed fear, not government restrictions, was the driving force behind lost economic activity from the virus.
âAt the same time,â?Mr. Goolsbee said, âit also shows promise: the fact that when we get control of the spread of the virus, or even stabilize the spread of the virus, the economy wants to come back.â?The greatest lift to the country, and likely to Mr. Biden's popularity, from finally curbing the virus would not be regained business sales or jobs created. It would be stemming a death toll that has climbed to about 650,000 since the pandemic began.
âI always tell undergraduates, when they take economics with me, that economics is not about optimizing output,â?said Mr. FernÃ¡ndez-Villaverde, the University of Pennsylvania economist. âIt's about optimizing welfare. And if you're dead, you're not getting a lot of welfare.â?Ben Casselman contributed reporting from New York.

In some less-vaccinated states like Texas that have experienced a large Delta wave, data suggest rising hospitalization and death rates are not driving down activity as much as they did in previous waves.
  ''It appears the latest Covid surge has been less impactful on the economy than previous surges in Texas,'' said Laila Assanie, a senior business economist at the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas, which surveys employers in the state each month about their activity during the pandemic.
  Business owners, Ms. Assanie said, ''said they were better prepared this time around.''
  Respondents to the survey said consumer spending had not fallen off as much this summer, compared with the initial spread of the coronavirus in March 2020 or a renewed spike last winter, even as case and hospitalization rates neared their previous peak from January. But many employers reported staffing pressures from workers falling ill with the virus. The share of businesses reporting that concerns about the pandemic were an impediment to hiring workers tripled from July to August.
  Data from Homebase, which provides time-management software to small businesses, show that employment in entertainment, dining and other coronavirus-sensitive sectors has fallen in recent weeks as the Delta variant has spread. But the decline is smaller than during the spike in cases last winter, suggesting that economic activity has become less sensitive to the pandemic over time. Other measures likewise show that economic activity has slowed but not collapsed as cases have risen.
  That trend has helped bolster overall consumer spending and hiring in the short term and helped keep the economy on track for its fastest annual growth in a quarter century. But there is a risk that it will be undercut by a continued pandemic dampening of labor force participation. Economists who have tracked the issue say that even if consumers have grown more accustomed to shopping or dining out as cases rise, there is little sign that would-be workers, even vaccinated ones, have become more accepting of the risks of returning to service jobs as the pandemic rages.
  ''It's becoming increasingly clear that employers are eager to hire,'' said Andrew Atkeson, an economist at the University of California at Los Angeles who has released several papers on the economics of the pandemic. ''The problem is not that people aren't spending. It's that people are still reluctant to go back to work''
  The Delta wave also appears to be sidelining some workers by disrupting child care and, in some cases, schools -- forcing parents to take time off or to delay returning to jobs.
  Some forecasters believe the combination of rising vaccination rates and a growing share of Americans who have already contracted the virus will soon arrest the Delta wave and set the economy back on track for rapid growth, with small-business hiring and restaurant visits rebounding as soon as the end of this month. ''Now is the time to start thinking about the post-Delta world,'' Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, wrote in a research note this month.
  Other economists see the possibility that a continued Delta wave -- or a surge from another variant in the months to come -- will substantially slow the recovery, because potential workers in particular remain sensitive to the spread of the virus.
  ''That's a very real danger,'' said Austan Goolsbee, a former head of the Council of Economic Advisers under President Barack Obama whose research earlier in the pandemic showed fear, not government restrictions, was the driving force behind lost economic activity from the virus.
  ''At the same time,'' Mr. Goolsbee said, ''it also shows promise: the fact that when we get control of the spread of the virus, or even stabilize the spread of the virus, the economy wants to come back.''
  The greatest lift to the country, and likely to Mr. Biden's popularity, from finally curbing the virus would not be regained business sales or jobs created. It would be stemming a death toll that has climbed to about 650,000 since the pandemic began.
  ''I always tell undergraduates, when they take economics with me, that economics is not about optimizing output,'' said Mr. FernÃ¡ndez-Villaverde, the University of Pennsylvania economist. ''It's about optimizing welfare. And if you're dead, you're not getting a lot of welfare.''

2021/9/10,New Threat Compelling the President: A Sagging Economy,Section A; Column 0; National Desk; Pg. 1; NEWS ANALYSIS,"The vaccines are effective at preventing serious illness and death, but they are not a golden shield against the coronavirus.
A wedding in Oklahoma leads to 15 vaccinated guests becoming infected with the coronavirus. Raucous Fourth of July celebrations disperse the virus from Provincetown, Mass., to dozens of places across the country, sometimes carried by fully vaccinated celebrants. 
  As the Delta variant surges across the nation, reports of infections in vaccinated people have become increasingly frequent -- including, most recently, among at least six Texas Democrats, a White House aide and an aide to Speaker Nancy Pelosi.
  The highly contagious variant, combined with a lagging vaccination campaign and the near absence of preventive restrictions, is fueling a rapid rise in cases in all states, and hospitalizations in nearly all of them. It now accounts for about 83 percent of infections diagnosed in the United States.
  But as worrying as the trend may seem, breakthrough infections -- those occurring in vaccinated people -- are still relatively uncommon, experts said, and those that cause serious illness, hospitalization or death even more so. More than 97 percent of people hospitalized for Covid-19 are unvaccinated.
  ''The takeaway message remains, if you're vaccinated, you are protected,'' said Dr. Celine Gounder, an infectious disease specialist at Bellevue Hospital Center in New York. ''You are not going to end up with severe disease, hospitalization or death.''
  Reports of breakthrough infections should not be taken to mean that the vaccines do not work, Dr. Anthony S. Fauci, the Biden administration's top pandemic adviser, said on Thursday at a news briefing.
  ''By no means does that mean that you're dealing with an unsuccessful vaccine,'' he said. ''The success of the vaccine is based on the prevention of illness.''
  Still, vaccinated people can come down with infections, overwhelmingly asymptomatic or mild. That may come as a surprise to many vaccinated Americans, who often assume that they are completely shielded from the virus. And breakthrough infections raise the possibility, as yet unresolved, that vaccinated people may spread the virus to others.
  Given the upwelling of virus across much of the country, some scientists say it is time for vaccinated people to consider wearing masks indoors and in crowded spaces like shopping malls or concert halls -- a recommendation that goes beyond current guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, which recommends masking only for unvaccinated people.
  The agency does not plan to change its guidelines unless there is a significant change in the science, said a federal official speaking on condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak on the matter.
  The agency's guidance already gives local leaders latitude to adjust their policies based on rates of transmission in their communities, he added. Citing the rise of the Delta variant, health officials in several California jurisdictions are already urging a return to indoor masking; Los Angeles County is requiring it.
  ''Seatbelts reduce risk, but we still need to drive carefully,'' said Dr. Scott Dryden-Peterson, an infectious disease physician and epidemiologist at Brigham & Women's Hospital in Boston. ''We're still trying to figure out what is 'drive carefully' in the Delta era, and what we should be doing.''
  The uncertainty about Delta results in part from how it differs from previous versions of the coronavirus. Although its mode of transmission is the same -- it is inhaled, usually in indoor spaces -- Delta is thought to be about twice as contagious as the original virus.
  Significantly, early evidence also suggests that people infected with the Delta variant may carry roughly a thousandfold more virus than those infected with the original virus. While that does not seem to mean that they get sicker, it does probably mean that they are more contagious and for longer.
  Dose also matters: A vaccinated person exposed to a low dose of the coronavirus may never become infected, or not noticeably so. A vaccinated person exposed to extremely high viral loads of the Delta variant is more likely to find his or her immune defenses overwhelmed.
  The problem grows worse as community transmission rates rise, because exposures in dose and number will increase. Vaccination rates in the country have stalled, with less than half of Americans fully immunized, giving the virus plenty of room to spread.
  Unvaccinated people ''are not, for the most part, taking precautions, and that's what's driving it for everybody,'' said Dr. Eric J. Rubin, the editor in chief of the New England Journal of Medicine. ''We're all susceptible to whatever anyone's behavior is in this epidemic.''
  Dr. Gounder likened the amount of protection offered by the vaccines to a golf umbrella that keeps people dry in a rainstorm. ''But if you're out in a hurricane, you're still going to get wet,'' she said. ''That's kind of the situation that the Delta variant has created, where there's still a lot of community spread.''
  For the average vaccinated person, a breakthrough infection is likely to be inconsequential, causing few to no symptoms. But there is concern among scientists that a few vaccinated people who become infected may go on to develop long Covid, a poorly understood constellation of symptoms that persists after the active infection is resolved.
  Much has been made of Delta's ability to sidestep immune defenses. In fact, all of the existing vaccines seem able to prevent serious illness and death from the variant. In laboratory studies, Delta actually has proved to be a milder threat than Beta, the variant first identified in South Africa.
  Whether a vaccinated person ever becomes infected may depend on how high antibodies spiked after vaccination, how potent those antibodies are against the variant, and whether the level of antibodies in the person's blood has waned since immunization.
  In any case, immune defenses primed by the vaccines should recognize the virus soon after infection and destroy it before significant damage occurs.
  ''That is what explains why people do get infected and why people don't get seriously ill,'' said Michel C. Nussenzweig, an immunologist at Rockefeller University in New York. ''It's nearly unavoidable, unless you're going to give people very frequent boosters.''
  There is limited evidence beyond anecdotal reports to indicate whether breakthrough infections with the Delta variant are more common or more likely to fan out to other people. The C.D.C. has recorded about 5,500 hospitalizations and deaths in vaccinated people, but it is not tracking milder breakthrough infections.
  Additional data is emerging from the Covid-19 Sports and Society Workgroup, a coalition of professional sports leagues that is working closely with the C.D.C. Sports teams in the group are testing more than 10,000 people at least daily and sequencing all infections, according to Dr. Robby Sikka, a physician who worked with the N.B.A.'s Minnesota Timberwolves.
  Breakthrough infections in the leagues seem to be more common with the Delta variant than with Alpha, the variant first identified in Britain, he said. As would be predicted, the vaccines cut down the severity and duration of illness significantly, with players returning less than two weeks after becoming infected, compared with nearly three weeks earlier in the pandemic.
  But while they are infected, the players carry very high amounts of virus for seven to 10 days, compared with two or three days in those infected with Alpha, Dr. Sikka said. Infected players are required to quarantine, so the project has not been able to track whether they spread the virus to others -- but it's likely that they would, he added.
  ''If they're put just willy-nilly back into society, I think you're going to have spread from vaccinated individuals,'' he added. ''They don't even recognize they have Covid because they think they're vaccinated.''
  Elyse Freitas was shocked to discover that 15 vaccinated people became infected at her wedding. Dr. Freitas, 34, a biologist at the University of Oklahoma, said she had been very cautious throughout the pandemic, and had already postponed her wedding once. But after much deliberation, she celebrated the wedding indoors on July 10. 
  Based on the symptoms, Dr. Freitas believes that the initial infection was at a bachelorette party two days before the wedding, when a dozen vaccinated people went unmasked to bars in downtown Oklahoma City; seven of them later tested positive. Eventually, 17 guests at the wedding became infected, nearly all with mild symptoms.
  ''In hindsight, I should have paid more attention to the vaccination rates in Oklahoma and the emergence of the Delta variant and adjusted my plans accordingly,'' she said.
  An outbreak in Provincetown, Mass., illustrates how quickly a cluster can grow, given the right conditions. During its famed Fourth of July celebrations, the small town hosted more than 60,000 unmasked revelers, dancing and mingling in crowded bars and house parties.
  The crowds this year were much larger than usual, said Adam Hunt, 55, an advertising executive who has lived in Provincetown part time for about 20 years. But the bars and clubs didn't open until they were allowed to, Mr. Hunt noted: ''We thought we were doing the right thing. We thought we were OK.''
  Mr. Hunt did not become infected with the virus, but several of his vaccinated friends who had flown in from places as far as Hawaii and Alabama tested positive after their return. In all, the cluster has grown to at least 256 cases -- including 66 visitors from other states -- about two-thirds in vaccinated people. 
  ''I did not expect that people who were vaccinated would be becoming positive at the rate that they were,'' said Steve Katsurinis, chair of the Provincetown Board of Health. Provincetown has moved swiftly to contain the outbreak, reinstating a mask advisory and stepping up testing. It is conducting 250 tests a day, compared with about eight a day before July 1, Mr. Katsurinis said.
  Health officials should also help the public understand that vaccines are doing what they are supposed to -- preventing people from getting seriously ill, said Kristen Panthagani, a geneticist at Baylor College of Medicine who runs a blog explaining complex scientific concepts.
  ''Vaccine efficacy isn't 100 percent -- it never is,'' she said. ''We shouldn't expect Covid vaccines to be perfect, either. That's too high an expectation.''

She was known as the ""Queen of Dreams."" She was born December 30, 1922 in New York to Henry and Stella Hein Falk along with siblings Eleanor, Norma and John. She received her Bachelor's and Master's degrees in psychology The University of Toronto. 
She earned her Ph.D. from Cornell University in 1949. At a time when women were discouraged from careers in general, she became a pioneer in the fields of psych- ology, psychological sleep science and clinical sleep medicine and one of the first women to establish herself in those fields. She wrote four books and hundreds of scholarly papers on the topics of psychology, sleep and dreaming. She sat on and chaired committees at the NIMH and NIH, ensuring that women and women's issues were represented in research studies. In 1962, she built her first sleep lab at the University of Illinois College of Medicine, studied the relationship between REM sleep and dreaming and wrote her first book, ""Night Life; Explorations in Dreaming"" 1977, Prentice Hall. She became professor and chairman of the Department of Behavioral Sciences at Rush University Medical Center, in Chicago and founder and director of one of the first clinical centers for the diagnosis and treatment of sleep disorders there. She studied the sleep and dreams of couples during divorce to discern the role of dreams in overcoming trauma. She discovered that those who processed trauma through their dreams were more likely to recover quickly. She published those results in the book, ""Crisis Dreaming"", Harper Collins. In 2004 she was named Distinguished Scientist of The Year, by the Sleep Research Society. She treated patients with; Depression, Insomnia, Sleep Apnea, Sleepwalking and other disorders of sleep. She acted as an expert witness at trial to advise on the mental states of people who had committed crimes in their sleep and to educate lawyers and juries on the science of sleep. Using scientific findings she explained how sleepwalkers can act without knowledge of their actions, and could therefore be not wholly responsible for their crimes. Individuals were exonerated as a result of her testimony. She retired at 86 and became Professor Emerita. In 2010 she published, ""The Twenty Four Hour Mind; The Role of Sleep and Dreaming in Our Emotional Lives,"" Oxford University Press, bringing together decades of research on sleep and its disorders to present a new theory of how the human brain works to process and integrate the content of the day. She worked well into her 90's completing a second edition of her last book. She is preceded in death by her husband, Richard P. Dennis and her daughter Christine Cartwright. She is survived by her daughter Carolyn Cartwright, and grandson Maximilian Meyers, her stepdaughter Amy Russell and son-in-law Bret Russell, her grandchildren Matthew and Mark Russell, her niece Mara Thompson and her great- grandchildren.

2021/2/7,"Paid Notice: Deaths CARTWRIGHT, ROSALIND DYMOND",Section A; Column 0; Classified; Pg. 23,"By the time Doug Raysby's wife was allowed to enter his hospital room, it was too late to be sure whether he even knew she was there. After a feverish fight with the coronavirus, he lay unconscious on the bed. His wife cried through an N95 mask, while a computer tablet flashed a video stream of his children saying goodbye.
For weeks, as coronavirus cases spiked across the United States, deaths rose far more slowly, staying significantly lower than in the early, deadliest weeks of the nation's outbreak in the spring. New treatments, many hoped, might slow a new wave of funerals. 
  But now, signs are shifting: More than 1,000 Americans are dying of the coronavirus every day on average, a 50 percent increase in the last month. Iowa, Minnesota, New Mexico, Tennessee and Wisconsin have recorded more deaths over the last seven days than in any other week of the pandemic. Twice this past week, there have been more than 1,400 deaths reported in a single day.
  ''It's getting bad and it's potentially going to get a lot worse,'' said Jennifer Nuzzo, an epidemiologist and senior scholar at the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security. ''The months ahead are looking quite horrifying.''
  For families like Mr. Raysby's, the pain of personal loss has combined with a sense of anger that the nation, exhausted after nine months of the pandemic, has grown inured to the death toll, even as its pace is now quickening once more.
  ''Do you see this human being? Do you realize?'' said Kathy James, the mother-in-law of Mr. Raysby, a 57-year-old factory supervisor in Sioux Falls, S.D., who liked to hunt pheasants on the weekends. In the weeks since Mr. Raysby died of the virus, Ms. James said she had wanted to wave a photo of him -- a quiet, bespectacled man who once wooed her daughter with purple roses -- at the world.
  ''Do you see Doug?'' she said. ''Because he should be alive and he should be with us right now.''
  More than 244,000 people have died from the coronavirus in the United States, more than any other country, and experts say the pace of new deaths is likely to accelerate in the coming weeks.
  Deaths lag several weeks behind infections, so the toll being recorded now reflects transmission that happened several weeks ago, before the country began logging more than 140,000 new cases per day and hospitalizations reached their highest levels of the pandemic. On Friday, public health officials reported more than 181,000 new cases across the country, more than ever before.
  The country remains far below the death toll of the spring, when as many as 2,200 people were perishing each day, but some estimates suggest that the United States may soon be on track to reach or even exceed those levels.
  From the Midwest to the Sun Belt, officials are bracing for a mounting death toll.
  In Marathon County, Wis., a sprawling community in the grip of a Covid-19 surge, a refrigerated morgue truck is now cooled and ready in case it is needed. The medical examiner's office has stocked extra body bags. A smaller, walk-in cooler was also brought in.
  Two hours southeast, in Fond du Lac County, Wis., Dr. Adam Covach, the chief medical examiner, said the system had been strained by the uptick in deaths. Funeral homes are exceedingly busy. Dr. Covach has looked at his own storage capacity and wondered: How soon could his office be overwhelmed? ''If things continue increasing at the rate they're going, it's going to start getting pretty scary pretty fast,'' he said.
  In El Paso, there have been so many coronavirus deaths in recent days that the county medical examiner parked five mobile morgue units -- the size of trucks -- outside its doors. Legacy Mortuary Service, a company that transports bodies from hospitals to funeral homes, is busier than ever, carrying 40 to 50 bodies most days now, its owner, Pilar Contreras, said.
  German Alvarado said he had to wait nearly two weeks to hold a funeral for his father-in-law, Antonio Sierra Macias, a professional mechanic who died of the virus.
  Mr. Alvarado said his wife and three children under the age of 12 first showed symptoms, then he got it, too. By mid-October, Mr. Sierra Macias also fell sick and was admitted to a hospital, where he learned he had diabetes, in addition to high blood pressure.
  Things seemed to be improving, but Mr. Sierra Macias took a turn for the worse. He was 49.
  Mr. Alvarado said it was difficult to contend with such loss even as people around him seemed not to be taking the virus seriously, believing it was being overhyped or thinking, somehow, that it was not dangerous.
  ''It seems like people think the news are overthinking, overtalking,'' said Mr. Alvarado, who said he was waiting for paperwork to send his father-in-law's body for burial in Ciudad JuÃ¡rez, Mexico, where cemeteries are running out of room. ''You don't realize the situation until you live through it.''
  Improved medical treatments for the virus have emerged in the months since it first arrived in the United States, offering hope that even if cases soared before a vaccine was available, deaths might be held off.
  A steroid, dexamethasone, has been shown to help the seriously ill; a new antibody treatment, similar to a therapy given to President Trump shortly after he contracted the coronavirus, just won emergency approval from the Food and Drug Administration; and doctors now know to turn patients on their stomachs to improve oxygen flow, one of the many best practices that have emerged over months of contending with Covid-19. The case fatality rate -- a crude measure that looks at the share of people who die out of those who are known to have tested positive -- has fallen throughout the pandemic, according to public health experts.  That is in part because the country is conducting far more tests, and also because the age demographics have changed, with more cases among young people, who are less likely to get seriously ill.
  Still, hospitals are now filling with patients, threatening the limits of medical systems in some regions. More than 68,000 people are in the hospital with the virus, greater than two earlier peaks in the spring and summer. Even the best medicines and techniques lose their usefulness if too many people get sick at the same time, taxing staffing and supplies.
  ''When you've overwhelmed the health care system, nobody is going to get optimal care,'' said Dr. Jessica Justman, an epidemiologist at Columbia University.
  The rising case numbers -- and the threat of mounting deaths -- have led some experts to call for a coordinated national shutdown for four to six weeks. Other experts have advocated for a combination of masks, increased testing, paid support for people in quarantine and targeted shutdowns focused on high-risk indoor spaces as a way to slow the toll.
  ''We can expect the case and death count to continue to rise exponentially unless we take serious measures to mitigate the virus,'' said Dr. Howard Markel, a historian of epidemics at the University of Michigan. ''All of this is terrible news.''
  But with no announcements from the White House for new measures to respond to the soaring outbreak, most of the country is open for business, even as a few governors began calling for new restrictions on Friday.
  Gov. Michelle Lujan Grisham of New Mexico issued the most sweeping statewide mandate this fall, returning to a ''stay at home'' order on Monday that will last two weeks. In Oregon, Gov. Kate Brown plans to put the state in a partial lockdown for two weeks starting Wednesday, shuttering gyms, halting restaurant dining and mandating that social gatherings have no more than six people.
  A visibly angry Gov. Mark Gordon of Wyoming, speaking at a news conference, said that hospitals have set up tents because they are overrun, that patients from crowded facilities in South Dakota have been sent into Wyoming, and that misinformation about the virus was running rampant. He said he was considering a mask mandate and other restrictions after months of hesitation. People in Wyoming have been ''knuckleheads'' about the virus, he said.
  ''We've relied on people to be responsible and they're being irresponsible,'' Mr. Gordon said. ''If I can't rely on you, we're going to have to do something else.''
  Particularly painful to those who are part of a growing group who have lost relatives is a sense of indifference about the outbreak, they say, by the public.
  The family of Tagan Drone, a 5-year-old girl with a toothy smile and big, colorful bows in her hair, said she had just started kindergarten in Amarillo, Texas. She loved Peppa Pig, nail polish and everything purple and pink. She was learning how to spell her name. For Halloween, she was going to dress up as a mermaid.
  But a few days before, she grew sluggish and started throwing up. Her mother took her to get medical treatment, where her family says she tested positive for the coronavirus.
  Tagan's parents offered her soup and ginger ale for dinner, and gave her a bath before bed. Hours later, they found her unresponsive.
  Children rarely need to be hospitalized with the virus, and very few die, according to the American Academy of Pediatrics. No autopsy was conducted, her parents say, but Amarillo city officials said she was one of two young people in the area whose deaths have been attributed to Covid-19.
  ''It's traumatizing,'' her father, Quincy Drone, 30, said, speaking from a hotel room where he and Tagan's mother, Lastassija White, have been staying because they cannot bear to return home, where Tagan used to swing from her bed like on monkey bars. They watched numbly as families they knew went trick-or-treating on Halloween, and as other children filed into school in their neighborhood.
  ''It scared our community, but it scared them for maybe 12 to 20 hours and then everybody went back to normal life,'' Mr. Drone said. ''And that's really how the world is.''

Laurie and Rick Vant Hoff have spent the last six winters in a rented property in Cape San Blas, Fla. This year, the retired couple, who live in Wisconsin, intended to stay until the end of March â?their longest stint as so-called snowbirds, Ms. Vant Hoff, 64, said.
At least that was the plan until several weeks ago, when the news of the coronavirus pandemic began spreading in the United States. First, friends who were supposed to join them called to cancel, then restaurants gradually switched to only offering takeout or deliveries, and finally, Cape San Blas closed its beaches.
âThat's when we really started thinking, boy, should we be staying?â?said Ms. Vant Hoff, a retired accounting assistant.

Millions of Americans â?mostly over the age of 60, many of them retired â?take part in an annual migration from the cold North to the balmy South each winter. Now, many of them are faced with a travel dilemma amid the outbreak: Should they stay or should they go? Many miss their families and wish they could be closer to home in case of an emergency. Others worry about being far away from their health care providers. Some just had plans, and want to know if they should keep them.
âWe don't know what's better,â?Ms. Vant Hoff said. âIs it better for us to stay here for a whole month or is it better to go home?â?Some people had no choice but to return.
Christine and Paul Lauster, a retired couple from Clyde, a small town in upstate New York, take their camping trailer on an annual winter trip, and were staying in a Florida state park when news of the virus began spreading. In late March, Florida announced it was closing its state parks to contain the spread of the coronavirus.
With their reservations canceled, the trip had come to an end, said Ms. Lauster, 68, a retired school librarian. They watched as friends packed their belongings within hours and hit the road the following day. Then they started planning their own drive home.
It took them about three days to get to upstate New York. Hours into their drive, one of the camper's wheels came off, which forced them to stop in Virginia for a âBand-Aid fix,â?Ms. Lauster said. The following day, after driving for about 11 hours, they made it to Clyde a little after midnight. They plan to remain under self-quarantine for two weeks.
âIt was a relief to be home,â?Ms. Lauster said. âThere's no longer the pressure of what happens if they close roads, if they close gas stations?â?In Texas, another popular state for snowbirds (though they are called winter Texans there), private campgrounds remain open and largely full, said Brian Schaeffer, the executive director and chief executive of the Texas Association of Campground Owners. His 400 members, made up of private campgrounds and R.V. parks, have only seen about a five percent decline in reservations and will continue to operate as essential businesses. The majority of the parks' visitors usually stay for an entire season.
Mr. Schaeffer said he thought it was better for visitors to shelter in place in South Texas. âBetter to do that than risk traveling through multiple states to get back home. Once things settle down, then you can go back.â?As precautions, he said, many of the parks have closed common areas like recreation halls and pools to prevent guests from gathering.
Luanne Thielke, 77, a retired business owner, spends the winters in Palm Desert, Calif., with her husband and has an early April flight scheduled back to Oregon.
Her husband, 78, has a follow-up doctor's appointment he cannot miss, Ms. Thielke said, and both of them have underlying health conditions.
So far, they are sticking with their plan to ship their car and board the plane, she said.
âWe think it's better to fly,â?Ms. Thielke said. âWe made the plans and it's just in God's hands.â?Adina Schorr, a retired interior designer who spends her winters in a gated community in Boca Raton, Fla., initially wanted to fly back to her apartment in New York City.
âI wanted to be much closer to my children, even if I would be locked up in my apartment,â?said Ms. Schorr, 81, whose husband died last year.
But her three children convinced her that staying where she was, even by herself, was the safest option for her, Ms. Schorr said.
To make her feel less alone, one of her three children, his wife and her grandchild temporarily moved to the same gated community where they are living with their in-laws. They still practice social distancing, Ms. Schorr said, but at least they can go out for a walk together or spend some time outside as a family.
âI'll wait because there is no reason for me to rush back,â?Ms. Schorr said. âIt really doesn't matter where you are because you cannot come close to each other.â?Part of the debate about whether to stay or go involves the trip home, often a long drive, usually made over several days.

As of Wednesday evening, the manor had none of its seven bedrooms booked, Mr. Griffey, 72, said.

2020/3/29,Snowbirds Deliberate: Go Home or Stay Put?,Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 9,"What the Djokovic affair reveals about global border policing.
From ''The Daily'' newsletter: One big idea on the news, from the team that brings you ''The Daily'' podcast. You can sign up for the newsletter here. 
  It was a curt condemnation: ''Rules are rules,'' Prime Minister Scott Morrison said after his government revoked Novak Djokovic's visa ahead of the Australian Open.
  But Australia's pandemic rules aren't just rules. They're a legal regime, constructed in crisis, that express something deeper about the national character -- what is valued, what is policed and what is worthy of contempt.
  In Australia, disdain for the foreign, the unfamiliar, the successful and the expansive has long informed national policy. The country's pandemic policing, some of the harshest in the world, is an outgrowth of its myopia and insularity, according to Damien Cave, the Australia bureau chief for The New York Times.
  Covid-19 served to solidify anti-immigrant sentiment -- and one of the most severe border-policing systems of any developed country. While the regulations of a regional police state might feel as parochial as the country's policies, the influence of these decisions ripple far beyond Australia's borders. Here's how:
  A history of unsafe harbors
  The modern state of Australia was born just before the world's oldest person, populated with seafaring immigrants who enacted the systematic extermination of the country's Indigenous population. But over the course of Australia's relatively short national history, the government has insisted on policing the same migration that was essential to its founding.
  For most of the last century, the so-called White Australia policy restricted nonwhite immigration -- and the sentiment behind that policy persists in today's government. In the last decade, Australia has insisted on a zero-tolerance approach to asylum seekers, spending $15 million on advertising campaigns with slogans like ''No way: You will not make Australia home'' in thick red text over photos of dark waves.
  Asylum seekers are often sent far from Australia's borders, detained indefinitely in Papua New Guinea or Nauru. Some self-immolate. Those who do make it to the mainland are detained indefinitely in Australian hotels, often without access to sunlight or fresh air. Some attempt suicide. Australians are largely comfortable with this immigration system -- with many wanting it to be even stricter.
  Pandemic-era policing
  Before the pandemic, a majority of Australian poll respondents believed that immigration was a burden on social welfare, and half wanted to see immigration levels reduced. The pandemic only intensified those views.
  In 2020, Australia locked its borders and the country's population shrank for the first time in 100 years. As Australia considered reopening its borders, 58 percent of voters said they supported restarting migration at a lower level than before the coronavirus. The pandemic also shifted the targets of border policing.
  Instead of focusing on deterring immigrants, the government began to criminalize the movement of Australian citizens, often at the expense of personal freedom. Early in the pandemic, Australians were prohibited from leaving the country without special government exemption or vaccination, restrictions that 81 percent of Australians supported.
  And last year, some Australians were banned from returning home -- and citizens attempting to return from India faced $66,600 in fines or five years in prison. Those who were allowed into the country faced expensive, arduous quarantines in remote facilities.
  Trickle-down isolationism
  Australia's immigration policies have been a source of inspiration for governments around the world, influencing the closing of global borders. Britain reportedly investigated holding their own asylum seekers in offshore detention centers, and former President Donald Trump, a friend of Prime Minister Morrison's, lauded Australia's approach to immigration before declaring a state of emergency to build a border wall.
  A 2016 report revealed that Australia's policies ''consciously cultivated or indirectly fostered negative developments in lower-income states'' like Indonesia, Kenya and Jordan, which collectively house over a million refugees.
  Australia's history of mass visa cancellation, a practice made public by the Djokovic affair, could have ripple effects, too. Britain recently introduced a controversial nationality and borders bill, which will no longer require officials to notify people before their citizenship is taken away. The British government has also recently expanded its power to impose visa penalties on countries that refuse to comply with its deportation policies.
  These are all rules, as Mr. Morrison said. But they're rules that also inspire other rules -- ones that influence and control how countries, and their citizens, relate.
  These rules govern a world in which tennis stars can become the source of collective national outrage, asylum seekers are detained offshore and movement is questioned not just between countries but within them.
  From The Daily team: 'How did we let people die this way?'
  This week, we are starting a new series in which we ask editors and producers on The Daily to take us behind the scenes of their favorite episode of the show that they've worked on.
  First up in this journey into the Daily archive is Anita Badejo, an editor based in London. She first joined the team in February 2021 from Pop-Up Magazine, where she served as the executive editor.
  Anita's pick is ''How Did We Let People Die This Way,'' an episode that first aired in November 2021 (you can listen to it here). We sat down with her to discuss the episode and the process of putting it together.
  Tell us a bit about ''How Did We Let People Die This Way''?
  It was an episode that we did with Nick Casey, the Madrid bureau chief at The Times. It profiled a man, MartÃ­n Zamora, who's carved out this very unique line of work for himself, collecting the bodies of people who have died at sea trying to migrate to Spain. He identifies who they are and then gets their bodies back to their families, mainly in North and West Africa.
  How did the episode come to be?
  The episode was pitched by Rachelle Bonja, who's one of our amazing producers who works a lot on international stories. [Read Rachelle's producer profile here.] Rachelle spotted the story Nick wrote about MartÃ­n for the paper and brought it up in one of our Daily morning meetings as a potential option for the show.
  Is there a moment from working on the episode that sticks out in your mind?
  Nick had already spent a lot of time with MartÃ­n over the course of multiple interviews, which he had recorded but, of course, they were in Spanish. We took the step of having all of the tape professionally translated to make sure we had a really good grasp of the content of the interviews.
  With the translations, I was able to sit down and read about this man, his experiences and the impact that doing this work has had on him personally. What I remember the most was when I read the transcript of what became the end of our episode -- this moment when MartÃ­n and Nick are driving on the way to his funeral home, and MartÃ­n describes how a lot of the families that he works with will send him videos of their loved ones. Often they're really full of life and hope and are so optimistic. MartÃ­n described in the interview that he sometimes is watching these videos right as the body of one of those people is laying in front of him on an embalming table. I remember reading that in the transcript and being really overwhelmed by what that must feel like.
  Is this episode representative of the kinds of episodes you like working on?
  I like to tell stories that are really human and grounded in a human experience. I'm always really excited when I get to work on our episodes that have a source and a character at the center of them who can really bring an issue to life and help people understand the impact of something that can seem really big and intractable, like global migration and the refugee crisis. I'm also drawn to stories that take an issue or problem in the world and present you with a story that you're always going to associate with that issue.
  When I read a headline about migration or a group of migrants or refugees who have died at sea -- which I do a lot because I'm based in the U.K. and we hear a lot about people trying to cross the English Channel -- I can't not think about Nick's story. I think about who is on the other side having to interact with that person's body and that family, what kind of toll this is taking on them. I've heard that from a lot of people who listened to this episode. It cracked open a facet of this issue that I had never even considered before. I'm not going to forget that.
  On The Daily this week
  Tuesday: An investigation into the civilian casualties of America's air wars and why the death tolls are so high.
  Wednesday: Inside President Biden and the Democrats' last-gasp push to pass bills in the Senate that would protect voting rights.
  Thursday: What is the metaverse, and why are tech companies like Microsoft investing in this new digital world?
  Friday: What the deportation of the tennis star Novak Djokovic revealed about Australia's border policies.
  That's it for the Daily newsletter. See you next week.

Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. For the latest updates, readThe New York Times's Covid-19 coverage here.
Dear Tripped Up,
In September 2019 B.C. â?âbefore coronavirusâ?â?my family and I booked a round-trip flight from Tampa, Fla., to London with British Airways, scheduled to depart in March. Then the coronavirus hit and our flight was canceled by the airline. We contacted British Airways to request a refund, but they have refused, stating they will only provide a voucher for future use. Philip
Dear Philip,
By now, you've probably read a number of coronavirus-related stories about refunds for canceled travel plans â?I've written a handful myself. But there's a reason we're deliberately pounding the topic into the ground: It's a big deal and there's lots of confusion and contradictory information out there.
To begin, airlines are required to issue cash refunds when they cancel (or significantly delay) flights because of the coronavirus pandemic. That applies to domestic airlines as well as international airlines for canceled flights to, within or from the United States.
As you know, travel restrictions and closed borders have asphyxiated commercial aviation; airlines have slashed       Â     routes and schedules. As of last month, airlines       Â     still owed passengers $35 billion for flights that could not or cannot take place, according to the International Air Transport Association, an industry group.
In an emailed statement, a British Airways spokeswoman said that you are, in fact, entitled to a refund; the airline's customer service team has reached out to you to resolve the issue. âIf a customer's flight has been canceled, they should call us to discuss their options. They can rebook, refund or choose to take a voucher to fly at a later date,â?she said.
The fact that you called and were initially told the exact opposite tracks with scores of other readers who feel that refunds have been turned into an all-out game of Frogger.
âAt best, airlines are just hiding the fact that customers are owed refunds if they want one,â?said Scott Keyes, an aviation industry expert and the founder of the website Scott's Cheap Flights. âAt worst, they're actively not giving those refunds even when they're asked. The thinking is: Right now we are in such a cash crunch that we want to maintain as much cash as possible â? we can deal with the reputation ramifications and legal ramifications down the road.â?Micky, another reader, got an email from Delta Air Lines with the subject line: âYour Trip Has Been Canceled.â?The body of the message stated that a canceled plane ticket had been turned into an eCredit; there were zero mentions of refunds.
I reached out to Delta (which just posted its first quarterly loss in five years) and was able to get Micky a refund. I also got the direct link to the refund form (here it is), which is otherwise buried in the FAQs on Delta's       Â     coronavirus landing page.
âTo save customers time, we proactively issued eCredits so they could easily reschedule without having to wait further. That said, customers whose flights have been canceled or significantly delayed by Delta are absolutely eligible for refunds upon request, in keeping with our longstanding policy. We'll evaluate opportunities to clarify this in future correspondence,â?said a company spokeswoman.
Last month, fueled by a surge in passenger complaints, the United States Department of Transportation issued a statement reminding airlines of their duty to issue refunds for canceled flights. But enforcement has been less than straightforward.
Class-action lawsuits against several major airlines, including Delta, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, are certain to crank up the pressure. In the meantime, there are three concrete things one can try that don't involve hiring a lawyer.
First, send the airline a direct message on social media. It may sound sophomoric, but several industry players have told me (anecdotally) that this can be a consistently reliable tactic. One reader also shared her luck with this approach.
âDelta did not notify us, but I saw online that the flights were canceled,â?Linda wrote. âNo emails. No phone calls. Nothing got a refund confirmation. Well, until I sent a private instant message through Facebook. Almost immediate reply. Asked for our names and confirmation number. Bingo. Refund confirmation received.â?The second course of action is to file a complaint with the transportation department. The federal agency tracks complaints by airline and releases them monthly; March complaints will be released in May and April complaints will be released in June. That data will be used by the department's Aviation Enforcement Office to monitor airlines' compliance with the refund policy, according to an agency spokeswoman.
Last tip: If you do manage to get an airline representative on the phone, do everything you can to get yourself passed around to another agent if the initial point of contact is unwilling to budge. That may mean asking to speak with a manager or asking to be transferred to a different department (then asking to be transferred back). Be patient; you'll need a good chunk of time in order to let your options play out.
Or, as Mr. Keyes recently put it on Twitter: âWhen a parent says 'no' what's the #1 thing every kid knows to do? Go ask the other parent.â?Sarah Firshein is a Brooklyn-based writer. If you need advice about a best-laid travel plan that went awry,       Â     send an email to travel@nytimes.com.

2020/5/1,Help! My Flight Was Canceled and I Still Can't Get a Refund Tripped Up,TRAVEL,"What the Djokovic affair reveals about global border policing.
From âThe Dailyâ?newsletter: One big idea on the news, from the team that brings you âThe Dailyâ?podcast. You can sign up for the newsletter here.
It was a curt condemnation: âRules are rules,â?Prime Minister Scott Morrison said after his government revoked Novak Djokovic's visa ahead of the Australian Open.
But Australia's pandemic rules aren't just rules. They're a legal regime, constructed in crisis, that express something deeper about the national character â?what is valued, what is policed and what is worthy of contempt.
In Australia, disdain for the foreign, the unfamiliar, the successful and the expansive has long informed national policy. The country's pandemic policing, some of the harshest in the world, is an outgrowth of its myopia and insularity, according to Damien Cave, the Australia bureau chief for The New York Times.
Covid-19 served to solidify anti-immigrant sentiment â?and one of the most severe border-policing systems of any developed country. While the regulations of a regional police state might feel as parochial as the country's policies, the influence of these decisions ripple far beyond Australia's borders. Here's how:
A history of unsafe harbors
The modern state of Australia was born just before the world's oldest person, populated with seafaring immigrants who enacted the systematic extermination of the country's Indigenous population. But over the course of Australia's relatively short national history, the government has insisted on policing the same migration that was essential to its founding.
For most of the last century, the so-called White Australia policy restricted nonwhite immigration â?and the sentiment behind that policy persists in today's government. In the last decade, Australia has insisted on a zero-tolerance approach to asylum seekers, spending $15 million on advertising campaigns with slogans like âNo way: You will not make Australia homeâ?in thick red text over photos of dark waves.
Asylum seekers are often sent far from Australia's borders, detained indefinitely in Papua New Guinea or Nauru. Some self-immolate. Those who do make it to the mainland are detained indefinitely in Australian hotels, often without access to sunlight or fresh air. Some attempt suicide. Australians are largely comfortable with this immigration system â?with many wanting it to be even stricter.
Pandemic-era policing
Before the pandemic, a majority of Australian poll respondents believed that immigration was a burden on social welfare, and half wanted to see immigration levels reduced. The pandemic only intensified those views.
In 2020, Australia locked its borders and the country's population shrank for the first time in 100 years. As Australia considered reopening its borders, 58 percent of voters said they supported restarting migration at a lower level than before the coronavirus. The pandemic also shifted the targets of border policing.
Instead of focusing on deterring immigrants, the government began to criminalize the movement of Australian citizens, often at the expense of personal freedom. Early in the pandemic, Australians were prohibited from leaving the country without special government exemption or vaccination, restrictions that 81 percent of Australians supported.
And last year, some Australians were banned from returning home â?and citizens attempting to return from India faced $66,600 in fines or five years in prison. Those who were allowed into the country faced expensive, arduous quarantines in remote facilities.
Trickle-down isolationism
Australia's immigration policies have been a source of inspiration for governments around the world, influencing the closing of global borders. Britain reportedly investigated holding their own asylum seekers in offshore detention centers, and former President Donald Trump, a friend of Prime Minister Morrison's, lauded Australia's approach to immigration before declaring a state of emergency to build a border wall.
A 2016 report revealed that Australia's policies âconsciously cultivated or indirectly fostered negative developments in lower-income statesâ?like Indonesia, Kenya and Jordan, which collectively house over a million refugees.
Australia's history of mass visa cancellation, a practice made public by the Djokovic affair, could have ripple effects, too. Britain recently introduced a controversial nationality and borders bill, which will no longer require officials to notify people before their citizenship is taken away. The British government has also recently expanded its power to impose visa penalties on countries that refuse to comply with its deportation policies.
These are all rules, as Mr. Morrison said. But they're rules that also inspire other rules â?ones that influence and control how countries, and their citizens, relate.
These rules govern a world in which tennis stars can become the source of collective national outrage, asylum seekers are detained offshore and movement is questioned not just between countries but within them.
From The Daily team: 'How did we let people die this way?'
This week, we are starting a new series in which we ask editors and producers on The Daily to take us behind the scenes of their favorite episode of the show that they've worked on.
First up in this journey into the Daily archive is Anita Badejo, an editor based in London. She first joined the team in February 2021 from Pop-Up Magazine, where she served as the executive editor.
Anita's pick is âHow Did We Let People Die This Way,â?an episode that first aired in November 2021 (you can listen to it here). We sat down with her to discuss the episode and the process of putting it together.
Tell us a bit about âHow Did We Let People Die This Wayâ?
It was an episode that we did with Nick Casey, the Madrid bureau chief at The Times. It profiled a man, MartÃ­n Zamora, who's carved out this very unique line of work for himself, collecting the bodies of people who have died at sea trying to migrate to Spain. He identifies who they are and then gets their bodies back to their families, mainly in North and West Africa.
How did the episode come to be?
The episode was pitched by Rachelle Bonja, who's one of our amazing producers who works a lot on international stories. [Read Rachelle's producer profile here.] Rachelle spotted the story Nick wrote about MartÃ­n for the paper and brought it up in one of our Daily morning meetings as a potential option for the show.
Is there a moment from working on the episode that sticks out in your mind?
Nick had already spent a lot of time with MartÃ­n over the course of multiple interviews, which he had recorded but, of course, they were in Spanish. We took the step of having all of the tape professionally translated to make sure we had a really good grasp of the content of the interviews.
With the translations, I was able to sit down and read about this man, his experiences and the impact that doing this work has had on him personally. What I remember the most was when I read the transcript of what became the end of our episode â?this moment when MartÃ­n and Nick are driving on the way to his funeral home, and MartÃ­n describes how a lot of the families that he works with will send him videos of their loved ones. Often they're really full of life and hope and are so optimistic. MartÃ­n described in the interview that he sometimes is watching these videos right as the body of one of those people is laying in front of him on an embalming table. I remember reading that in the transcript and being really overwhelmed by what that must feel like.
Is this episode representative of the kinds of episodes you like working on?
I like to tell stories that are really human and grounded in a human experience. I'm always really excited when I get to work on our episodes that have a source and a character at the center of them who can really bring an issue to life and help people understand the impact of something that can seem really big and intractable, like global migration and the refugee crisis. I'm also drawn to stories that take an issue or problem in the world and present you with a story that you're always going to associate with that issue.
When I read a headline about migration or a group of migrants or refugees who have died at sea â?which I do a lot because I'm based in the U.K. and we hear a lot about people trying to cross the English Channel â?I can't not think about Nick's story. I think about who is on the other side having to interact with that person's body and that family, what kind of toll this is taking on them. I've heard that from a lot of people who listened to this episode. It cracked open a facet of this issue that I had never even considered before. I'm not going to forget that.
On The Daily this week
Tuesday: An investigation into the civilian casualties of America's air wars and why the death tolls are so high.
Wednesday: Inside President Biden and the Democrats' last-gasp push to pass bills in the Senate that would protect voting rights.
Thursday: What is the metaverse, and why are tech companies like Microsoft investing in this new digital world?
Friday: What the deportation of the tennis star Novak Djokovic revealed about Australia's border policies.

2022/1/21,When Rules Aren't Just Rules,PODCASTS,"There's a reason we are deliberately pounding the topic of travel refunds into the ground: It's a big deal and there's lots of confusion and contradictory information out there.
Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. For the latest updates, readThe New York Times's Covid-19 coverage here.
Dear Tripped Up,
In September 2019 B.C. â?âbefore coronavirusâ?â?my family and I booked a round-trip flight from Tampa, Fla., to London with British Airways, scheduled to depart in March. Then the coronavirus hit and our flight was canceled by the airline. We contacted British Airways to request a refund, but they have refused, stating they will only provide a voucher for future use. Philip
Dear Philip,
By now, you've probably read a number of coronavirus-related stories about refunds for canceled travel plans â?I've written a handful myself. But there's a reason we're deliberately pounding the topic into the ground: It's a big deal and there's lots of confusion and contradictory information out there.
To begin, airlines are required to issue cash refunds when they cancel (or significantly delay) flights because of the coronavirus pandemic. That applies to domestic airlines as well as international airlines for canceled flights to, within or from the United States.
As you know, travel restrictions and closed borders have asphyxiated commercial aviation; airlines have slashed routes and schedules. As of last month, airlines still owed passengers $35 billion for flights that could not or cannot take place, according to the International Air Transport Association, an industry group.
In an emailed statement, a British Airways spokeswoman said that you are, in fact, entitled to a refund; the airline's customer service team has reached out to you to resolve the issue. âIf a customer's flight has been canceled, they should call us to discuss their options. They can rebook, refund or choose to take a voucher to fly at a later date,â?she said.
The fact that you called and were initially told the exact opposite tracks with scores of other readers who feel that refunds have been turned into an all-out game of Frogger.
âAt best, airlines are just hiding the fact that customers are owed refunds if they want one,â?said Scott Keyes, an aviation industry expert and the founder of the website Scott's Cheap Flights. âAt worst, they're actively not giving those refunds even when they're asked. The thinking is: Right now we are in such a cash crunch that we want to maintain as much cash as possible â?we can deal with the reputation ramifications and legal ramifications down the road.â?Micky, another reader, got an email from Delta Air Lines with the subject line: âYour Trip Has Been Canceled.â?The body of the message stated that a canceled plane ticket had been turned into an eCredit; there were zero mentions of refunds.
I reached out to Delta (which just posted its first quarterly loss in five years) and was able to get Micky a refund. I also got the direct link to the refund form (here it is), which is otherwise buried in the FAQs on Delta's coronavirus landing page.
âTo save customers time, we proactively issued eCredits so they could easily reschedule without having to wait further. That said, customers whose flights have been canceled or significantly delayed by Delta are absolutely eligible for refunds upon request, in keeping with our longstanding policy. We'll evaluate opportunities to clarify this in future correspondence,â?said a company spokeswoman.
Last month, fueled by a surge in passenger complaints, the United States Department of Transportation issued a statement reminding airlines of their duty to issue refunds for canceled flights. But enforcement has been less than straightforward.
Class-action lawsuits against several major airlines, including Delta, Southwest Airlines and United Airlines, are certain to crank up the pressure. In the meantime, there are three concrete things one can try that don't involve hiring a lawyer.
First, send the airline a direct message on social media. It may sound sophomoric, but several industry players have told me (anecdotally) that this can be a consistently reliable tactic. One reader also shared her luck with this approach.
âDelta did not notify us, but I saw online that the flights were canceled,â?Linda wrote. âNo emails. No phone calls. Nothing got a refund confirmation. Well, until I sent a private instant message through Facebook. Almost immediate reply. Asked for our names and confirmation number. Bingo. Refund confirmation received.â?The second course of action is to file a complaint with the transportation department. The federal agency tracks complaints by airline and releases them monthly; March complaints will be released in May and April complaints will be released in June. That data will be used by the department's Aviation Enforcement Office to monitor airlines' compliance with the refund policy, according to an agency spokeswoman.
Last tip: If you do manage to get an airline representative on the phone, do everything you can to get yourself passed around to another agent if the initial point of contact is unwilling to budge. That may mean asking to speak with a manager or asking to be transferred to a different department (then asking to be transferred back). Be patient; you'll need a good chunk of time in order to let your options play out.
Or, as Mr. Keyes recently put it on Twitter: âWhen a parent says 'no' what's the #1 thing every kid knows to do? Go ask the other parent.â?Sarah Firshein is a Brooklyn-based writer. If you need advice about a best-laid travel plan that went awry, send an email to travel@nytimes.com.

2020/5/1,Help! My Flight Was Canceled and I Still Can't Get a Refund Tripped Up,TRAVEL,"In this week's column, Sarah Firshein investigates the ever-changing refund policies offered by travel companies.
Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. For the latest updates, read The New York Times's Covid-19 coverage here. 
  Dear Tripped Up,
  Last September I booked a Japan tour with Abercrombie & Kent, scheduled to leave at the end of March. Three tickets came to more than $46,000, without airfare. What happens when you book your dream trip, only to confront travel restrictions and an exploding global pandemic? Nancy
  Dear Nancy,
  Last September, around the time you must have been booking your Japan trip, I took my first-ever surfing lesson in Barbados. Bobbing in the gentle, beginner-friendly bay, I learned the sport is all about timing: If you can't get ahead of the wave, you'll end up watching it thunder ashore without you.
  The same goes for writing about travel amid the daily-changing coronavirus pandemic.
  My original response to your question, which had been scheduled for the third week of March, included a detailed run-down about how tour operators work. I spoke to Abercrombie & Kent and even got you a credit -- yes, the full $46,000.
  The day the column was set to go to print, Abercrombie & Kent announced it was suspending all of its tours until (at least) the end of April. Its new, more flexible policies would have given you a $46,000 credit anyway. Much of what I wrote no longer applied, and to run it wouldn't have been fair. I've never been so happy to see one of my own pieces get ''killed.''
  Since the end of January, when the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency (six weeks before the term pandemic was applied), scores of Times readers have come forward with questions like yours. Then came three tectonic shifts in rapid succession: President Trump suspending travel from Europe for a month, the State Department issuing its highest travel advisory (Level 4, or ''Do Not Travel''), and countries all around the world closing their borders.
  The travel industry scrambled to keep up. Caveats and exclusions disappeared from cancellation and change policies -- even for airlines, which can be notoriously difficult. The cruise industry, after stammering with a full range of responses, finally threw in the towel and outright suspended sailings for a month. Tour operators like Abercrombie & Kent fell in line, too.
  In turn, I was barraged by readers requesting tips and advice about one thing: refunds.
  Take the two emails I received about flying on Norwegian Air. One reader asked how to get a refund for tickets on a flight that was still headed to Rome, despite the then-burgeoning coronavirus outbreak in Italy. The other questioned the airline's $110 change fee on a flight that happened to be departing New York City for Oslo the very day the Norwegian government closed the border.
  By the time I traded emails with a Norwegian Air spokesman, the airline was no longer flying from the United States to Rome or Oslo, and it had eliminated its change fees altogether.
  Looking for a Refund? Here are 4 Takeaways.
  Be patient; the travel industry is scrambling to keep up with the tectonic shifts in travel restrictions.
  As a result, customer service centers are also scrambling. Expect long wait and response times.
  If your trip isn't right around the corner, it's best to wait to cancel it -- especially if you don't need to immediately access the funds.
  It's in everyone's best interest to be flexible right now.
  Another reader emailed to tell me about a denied refund on two Airbnbs in Spain: ''This experience is making me question whether it's a good idea to use them in the future,'' she wrote.
  Airbnb announced a sweeping extenuating-circumstances cancellation policy five days later. I had only cursorily reached out to the company when a followup from the reader landed in my inbox: ''Airbnb emailed me today and promised a refund would be coming in the next 15 days.''
  But it was the exchange I had with Priceline that best illustrated the travel industry's high-speed reaction of the evolving pandemic.
  A reader named Bonnie emailed to say that Priceline had charged her a $518 fee when she canceled her April stay at a hotel in San Francisco. Meanwhile, the hotel itself was waiving cancellation fees.
  When I reached out to Priceline, I learned that on March 16 -- the day Bonnie canceled her reservation online -- the hotel's cancellation waiver had been communicated to all of Priceline's phone agents but had yet to be uploaded into the database that processes online cancellations. In other words, Bonnie had beaten Priceline to its own rush.
  That technical lag has since been fixed, and Bonnie's cancellation fee was refunded. A Priceline spokesman emailed, ''Please know that this was NOT her mistake -- this was ours entirely. We're also very sorry that it took several days for her to get the right answers. It's obviously a very busy time in travel, but when we learn about errors like these, we'll fix them immediately.''
  The situation also drives home a point that Jack Ezon, the founder of the luxury travel agency Embark, stressed when I called him a few weeks ago to get his perspective about the coronavirus's general effect on the industry: ''It's in everyone's best interest to be flexible right now.''
  Flexible cancellation and change policies foster goodwill and are an overall boon for their images. But they're also good for cash flow and long-term brand loyalty: the famous ''bird in the hand'' adage, said Mr. Ezon. ''If you want to entice people to buy, you need to make it easy for them to cancel,'' he said.
  But combine panicked consumers seeking refunds en masse, all-but-guaranteed customer-service logjams, and cancellation and change policies that have changed -- often drastically -- in a matter of weeks, and we're back in that water, attempting to time those waves just right.
  My reporting on the coronavirus so far has pointed to one key lesson: if your trip isn't right around the corner, it's best to wait to cancel it, especially if you don't need to immediately access the funds. Look no further than my parents' planned trip to Japan. In late February, when they lobbied All Nippon Airways for a refund on two round-trip business class tickets from New York City to Tokyo, they got a paltry offer: a $463 credit (total). Instead they held off, refreshing the airline's website a few times a week until their late-April departure date was finally covered by the airline's ballooning cancellation policy.
  Not only does the wait-and-see strategy save you from having to spend hours on hold, but, as the experiences above indicate, jumping in prematurely -- say, before policies are officially hammered out -- almost always guarantees a headache. There's a philosophical upside to this, as well, especially for those of us who are used to having trips on the calendar. It's unlikely I'll get to Menorca in September, but my not-yet-canceled hotel reservation is a small token of normalcy -- my own tiny show of optimism.

2020/4/12,I Need a Refund for a Tour to Japan,Section TR; Column 0; Travel Desk; Pg. 2; TRIPPED UP,"Release your inner explorer. Here's a way to relive, commemorate or envision a favorite place in the world by creating an illustrated map.
Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. For the latest updates, read The New York Times's Covid-19 coverage here.
Many of us are in the same situation: homebound, a little restless and a lot distracted. Not only are our future travel plans on hold, but even our local outings and excursions â?a quick trip to the market, a stroll in the park, a walk with the dog â?are limited. That doesn't mean we need to curtail our wanderlust or stop exploring the world around us, and within us. Here is an idea that will help fill the void left by travel restrictions and social distancing, redirect our attention to the immediate worlds we know best â?either before our eyes or in our minds â?while keeping our creative juices flowing:
Make an illustrated map!
The rigid and scientific rules of cartography simply do not apply here! Nope. While an illustrated map is often a wildly useless tool for providing directions, it can be a beautiful and highly personal reflection of a place you, friends and family know quite well. It can tell a story, a personal history, or be a unique lens through which one can experience a special place. An illustrated map can be loose and hand-drawn, filled with fun drawings and doodles that together make a sometimes inaccurate, but always spot on record of a memory or a place from one's own perspective.
As a freelance illustratorÂ who specializes in map illustration, I find that my clients â?hotels, travel magazines, colleges â?ask for an illustrated map because they want to excite their visitors, encourage them to learn more about or visit a specific place. You can use a comparable tactic to create your own illustrated map. Which place do you enjoy the most or know the best? Maybe it's a favorite vacation spot or even your immediate neighborhood. Using illustration to recreate and interpret a place rewards your creativity and shifts your imagination into a dreamy space of idealistic representation and positive recollection.
Follow these eight steps to make your own illustrated map:
1) Pick your destination
Will you illustrate a place you know and love? Maybe your last vacation? Your own neighborhood?
Or will you illustrate a place you've never been? Maybe the first place you plan to visit once travel is safe again? Or the No. 1 city on your bucket list? Or even a fictional place, like the city in your favorite book, film, or series?!
2) Make your list of go-to sites
What sites are there to see? What activities and experiences are there to have? What landmarks or natural wonders exist at your destination? Pick eight to 10 specific sites in and around your destination.
Consider a fun theme, like all the historical landmarks or public parks or favorite trees or interesting buildings â?the possibilities are endless! You could even build a narrative into your map, so that it tells the story of an adventure or illustrates a specific itinerary or captures the memories of your time at this place. For example, create a memory map of your childhood world!
3) Plot your sites
Before I start illustrating a map I use an online mapping tool, such as Google Maps, to plot all the sites. This helps me understand where they all are in relation to each other. This is totally optional â?doing it from memory sometimes produces hilarious results!
Using a large sheet of paper, start with the most important site on your list. Maybe this is your home or a hotel you've stayed in, or a famous landmark. Lightly sketch a little numbered marker for this site in the center of the space (you'll erase that marker later.) Next, place similar markers all around your central site.
It's OK to distort your map by reducing the distances between places â?throw accuracy out the window!
4) Sketch icons for each place
An icon is a little spot illustration that represents a site. It does not need to be a drawing of the actual building â?it could be anything! A bagel, a taco, a movie camera, a dog walker, an elephant, a rainbow, whatever is super fun and reminds you that specific site. Start with your central site: Erase the little marker and draw an icon in its place.
5) Place your title
Find the biggest empty space left on your sketch and use it for the title of your map.
6) Add roads
It's important to include at least a few major roads. These give viewers good points of reference.
7) Include other map elements
If you have more room, consider placing a compass, an inset map and a legend, too!
8) Fill it in with fun details
This is my favorite part! In the empty spaces on your map, illustrate trees, birds, animals, flowers, clouds, rainbows, cars, swirlies, dots, doodles, whatever you want!

2020/6/1,How to Make an Illustrated Map in 8 Steps,TRAVEL,"To look at the coronavirus pandemic in the United States in mid-July is to look at a country that is bisected into the new hot spots, where the coronavirus is surging, and the Northeast, where the outbreak first took hold. The new hot spots, mostly in the South and West, have propelled hospitalizations to new highs, a disturbing indicator of how far and how widely Covid-19, the disease caused by the virus, has spread. By contrast, from Delaware to Maine, new cases are well below their peaks in April, and of the 11 states where cases were mostly the same or declining on Wednesday, six were in the Northeast. 
  Among the hot spots, California passed an unenviable milestone. As of Wednesday, it had reported more cases than New York, the early epicenter of the pandemic.
  That meant that California has posted more cases than any other state -- more than 417,000. New York's case count stood just under 413,600. But it is difficult to know which state has actually had more infections. Both states had significant outbreaks very early on, when testing was limited, and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has said that large numbers of infections went undetected, easily dwarfing the number of known cases.
  Gov. Gavin Newsom of California said a stay-at-home order and efforts to increase hospital capacity had bought some time. Even as the now partly reopened state faces climbing case numbers, he said that it was in a better position than before to distribute protective equipment and tailor restrictions to allow more businesses to reopen.
  ''We are not going to let off in our day-to-day monitoring and our technical assistance,'' he said. ''We'll see those numbers increase and as a consequence, we need to be more vigilant and more aware of our personal behaviors and our collective behaviors.''
  New York remains by far the hardest-hit state by another measure. It has recorded 32,228 deaths from Covid-19, according to a New York Times database -- more than the next three states (New Jersey, Massachusetts and California) combined. On Tuesday, New York reported 15 deaths. Its seven-day average is about the same as at the end of March, before the explosion in cases.
  Mr. Newsom, in California, tweeted that the numbers ''tell us one thing: we MUST take this seriously. WEAR A MASK.'' That message was repeated by other worried officials: Mayor Muriel Bowser of the District of Columbia prepared an executive order that masks were mandatory outside of people's homes. Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio, a Republican, issued a statewide mask order that will take effect on Thursday. ''It is essential that we wear masks statewide in Ohio to contain the spread of this virus,'' he said, noting that more counties were seeing increasing numbers. He said the rate of increase had slowed in places where masks were mandatory.
  Troubling Numbers in Spain
  The average daily number of new cases in Spain has more than tripled in the month since the country ended its state of emergency. Spain now has 224 local outbreaks, the health minister, Salvador Illa, told Parliament on Wednesday. With the pandemic devastating the tourism industry, Madrid is worried that France may shut off the border, a possibility that Prime Minister Jean Castex did not rule out in comments to reporters on Saturday. The tourism minister, Reyes Maroto, said she hoped that would not prove necessary. She said new infections in Catalonia had declined in the last three days.
  But the authorities around Pamplona, in another province that borders France, are tightening restrictions in the neighborhood of Mendillorri because of an outbreak with 122 cases. The regional minister of health, Santos IndurÃ¡in Orduna, said more than 2,000 teenagers and young adults would be tested, because people between the ages of 17 and 28 accounted for more than 90 percent of the infections. Pamplona canceled its running of the bulls, the festival that figured in Ernest Hemingway's novel ''The Sun Also Rises.''
  Without exactly saying so, Britain is telling would-be travelers: Don't even think of going far, far away if you need a new passport. The government is urging people to postpone applying for passports because there is a logjam of more than 400,000 applications, the BBC reported. The United States is experiencing similar delays: In June, there was a backlog of 1.7 million Americans waiting for passports after the State Department shut down most of its consular services.
  The numbers in Australia's hard-hit Victoria state only get worse. It reported 484 new coronavirus cases on Wednesday, a record, and officials warned that the caseload could continue to increase. Melbourne has been in lockdown for two weeks, and the authorities had been counting on the infection rate to level off. Instead, the chief health officer, Brett Sutton, said Victoria could see 500 to 600 new cases a day.
  ''I absolutely don't want us to go there,'' he said.
  Wake Up! The Nobel Prize Dinner Is Off.
  Whether or not this year's Nobel Prize winners sleep through the all-important predawn call in October, they will not be invited to the annual banquet in Stockholm in December. It has been canceled because of the pandemic, the Nobel Foundation announced Tuesday. Most years, the dinner, for about 1,300 guests, is a standout in a week of high-powered events. This year, Lars Heikensten, the chief executive of the Nobel Foundation, said in a statement, ''We will pay different attention to the prize winners, their discoveries and works.'' The banquet was last canceled in 1956, to protest the Soviet Union's invasion of Hungary. It was also called off during the two world wars.
  As for slumbering through the call, the committees that select the winners telephone them just before their names are announced around noon Stockholm time -- 6 a.m. on the East Coast, 3 a.m. on the West Coast. Martin Chalfie of Columbia University, a co-recipient of the 2008 Nobel in chemistry, has said that he slept through it.
  ''I woke up at 10 after 6,'' he told the Nobel Foundation, and, figuring the prize had gone to someone else, said, '''OK, who's the schnook that got the prize this time?' And so I opened up my laptop, and I got to the Nobel Prize site and I found out I was the schnook'' -- along with Osamu Shimomura and Roger Tsien. The Nobel committees have since started leaving voice mail messages.Coronavirus Update wraps up the day's developments with information from across the virus report.

When New York's coronavirus rates began to skyrocket in mid-March, they seemed like a portent for the rest of the country. But at this point, New York City has five times as many Covid-19-related deaths as the entire state of California, with just a quarter of its population. How much blame for New York City's devastation should go to Mayor Bill de Blasio's slow response and early downplaying of the danger? Has Gov. Andrew Cuomo earned the praise his briefings have brought him, given his questionable policy choices? This week on âThe Argumentâ?podcast, Frank Bruni, Ross Douthat and Michelle Goldberg debate who deserves blame for New York's catastrophic mishandling of the crucial first weeks of the coronavirus. What mistakes led to the dispersion of the virus from the Empire State, and what lessons can be learned as other states start to reopen?
Then, as the luxury of dining out becomes a distant memory and grocery aisles remain unpredictably stocked, what has quarantine done to the act of enjoying a meal? Finally, Frank issues an ode to humble staples that bring spice to life.

Frank Bruni
I've been an Op-Ed columnist for The Times since 2011, but my career with the newspaper stretches back to 1995 and includes many twists and turns that reflect my embarrassingly scattered interests. I covered Congress, the White House and several political campaigns; I also spent five years in the role of chief restaurant critic. As the Rome bureau chief, I reported on the Vatican; as a staff writer for The Times's Sunday magazine, I wrote many celebrity profiles. That jumble has informed my various books, which focus on the Roman Catholic Church, George W. Bush, my strange eating life, the college admissions process and meatloaf. Politically, I'm grief-stricken over the way President Trump has governed and I'm left of center, but I don't think that the center is a bad place or âcompromiseâ?a dirty word. I'm Italian-American, I'm gay and I write a weekly Times newsletter in which you'll occasionally encounter my dog, Regan, who has the run of our Manhattan apartment.
Ross Douthat
I've been an Op-Ed columnist since 2009, and I write about politics, religion, pop culture, sociology and the places where they all intersect. I'm a Catholic and a conservative, in that order, which means that I'm against abortion and critical of the sexual revolution, but I tend to agree with liberals that the Republican Party is too friendly to the rich. I was against Donald Trump in 2016 for reasons specific to Donald Trump, but in general I think the populist movements in Europe and America have legitimate grievances and I often prefer the populists to the âreasonableâ?elites. I've written books about Harvard, the G.O.P., American Christianity and Pope Francis, and decadence. Benedict XVI was my favorite pope. I review movies for National Review and have strong opinions about many prestige television shows. I have four small children, three girls and a boy, and I live in New Haven with my wife.
Michelle Goldberg
I've been an Op-Ed columnist at The New York Times since 2017, writing mainly about politics, ideology and gender. These days people on the right and the left both use âliberalâ?as an epithet, but that's basically what I am, though the nightmare of Donald Trump's presidency has radicalized me and pushed me leftward. I've written three books, including one, in 2006, about the danger of right-wing populism in its religious fundamentalist guise. (My other two were about the global battle over reproductive rights and, in a brief detour from politics, about an adventurous Russian Ã©migrÃ© who helped bring yoga to the West.) I love to travel; a long time ago, after my husband and I eloped, we spent a year backpacking through Asia. Now we live in Brooklyn with our son and daughter.

2020/5/21,Did de Blasio Bungle the Crisis?,OPINION,"There are ways to prevent a crisis of public health from becoming a crisis of democracy.
This article is part of the Debatable newsletter. You can sign up here to receive it Tuesdays and Thursdays.
Will New York postpone its primary? (Maybe.) Do polling places have hand sanitizer? (      Â     Don't count on it.) And what happens if President Trump tries to cancel the election? (      Â     Probably not what you think.)
As the coronavirus spreads across the country, it has thrown much of American life into question, including the way we vote. In these uneasy days of social distancing, how can a democracy honor its duty to hold free and fair elections when doing so could aggravate a public-health crisis that threatens to kill millions of its citizens? Here's what people are saying.
Postpone the primaries
Gov. Mike DeWine of Ohio decided that holding an election now would be an unacceptable health risk. On Monday night, Mr. DeWine, a Republican, defied a court ruling and called off the state's presidential primary just hours before voting was supposed to start, pushing back its election possibly to June; Kentucky, Louisiana and Maryland       Â     also delayed their presidential primaries until June, while Georgia pushed its to May. While Joe Biden's campaign       Â     opposes postponements, Bernie Sanders has been more receptive to the idea: âI'm thinking about some of the elderly people sitting behind the desks, registering people, doing all that stuff. Does that make a lot of sense? I'm not sure that it does,â?he       Â     said on Sunday.
Elections held now could have their legitimacy questioned, as Jon Favreau, a former speechwriter for Barack Obama, suggested:
But some think postponing the primaries would be a grave misstep, in part because there is no knowing when the crisis will end. âIt is the sacred right and duty of Americans to cast their ballots for our nation's leaders,â?Terry McAuliffe and Tom Ridge, the former governors of Virginia and Pennsylvania, write in Politico. âWe must all ensure they're given the opportunity to safely do so.â?They argue that states should keep to the current primary schedule while expanding the use of mailed ballots to minimize the risk of coronavirus transmission. The logistical challenges of doing so on such short order, though, are       Â     formidable; President Trump       Â     called the idea of postponing the primaries âa very tough thing.â?End the primaries
Bernie Sanders can and should end the primaries by dropping out, Dan McLaughlin argues in National Review. Delay can be a workaround when an election still needs to be held, he says, but this one does not, since Mr. Sanders now stands very little chance of winning. âNobody will care if all the remaining Republican primaries are canceled,â?Mr. McLaughlin writes. âThe only reason to keep voting on the Democratic side is because of Bernie Sanders. Ending his campaign now would be the right thing for Bernie to do, for the good of the country.â?Ryan Grim, the Washington bureau chief for The Intercept, tweeted:
But Mr. Sanders has been a uniquely important voice during the coronavirus crisis, Gabriella Paiella writes in GQ. âSanders has spent a lifetime preaching about the necessity of acting collectively,â?she says. âIn a situation like this, when America's streak of rugged individualism spells out a death sentence, calling for togetherness is not only comforting, it's the best option we have for survival.â?If Mr. Sanders drops out now, he'll forfeit some of his ability to shape the Democratic Party's response to the crisis, Paul Blest       Â     argues in Vice. In any case, Michelle Cottle       Â     writes in The Times, Joe Biden will need to work overtime to convince progressives that he understands their concerns and can be trusted to address them.
OK, but what about November?
President Trump cannot cancel the general election, as The Times's Alexander Burns explains. The Constitution mandates that the president's term expire on Jan. 20; short of a constitutional amendment, that isn't changing.
But Congress could vote to delay the election a couple of months, as Dominic Holden reports at BuzzFeed. That's still highly unlikely, and it's too early to tell whether there would be any public health benefit to doing so. Justin Levitt, who led the Justice Department's voting section during the Obama administration, told Mr. Holden, âIf virus fears are bad enough in early November that you can't hold an election in many places, they're still going to be that bad on Dec. 31.â?[Related: âTrump Can't Cancel the Election. But States Could Do It for Him.â]
The United States has held elections during a pandemic before. At the height of the 1918 flu, midterm elections proceeded relatively normally, according to a 2010 article by Jason Marisam in Election Law Journal. Despite bans on public gatherings, there was little public debate about postponement, in part, he says, because of âthe push for public displays of civic-mindednessâ?during World War I. But turnout was significantly depressed, and, as John M. Barry       Â     notes in The Times, government officials and newspapers misled the public about how dangerous that flu really was: All told, it killed some       Â     675,000 Americans.
[Related: âWe Held an Election During the 1918 Flu Epidemic. We Can Hold an Election Now.â]
Revolutionize the presidential voting process
The presidential election is far enough away that its voting process can be overhauled. To that end, Senators Amy Klobuchar and Ron Wyden have introduced a bill that would guarantee every American a secure mail-in paper ballot and help states pay for printing, self-sealing envelopes, ballot tracking and postage. In-person polling sites need to remain open for those unable to vote by mail, so the bill would require all states to hold at least 20 days of early voting to cut down on crowding.
Democrats should refuse to pass any big stimulus bill unless it includes such election protection measures, the Times columnist David Leonhardt writes. âThat may sound like bare-knuckle politics, but preserving democracy calls for toughness,â?he says.
And the 11 states that don't offer online voter registration should start, according to the Brennan Center for Justice, since the coronavirus may reduce access to government offices that do registration work and cause Postal Service disruptions. The center also recommends that the 39 states that already offer online registration update their systems.
Taking actual voting online, on the other hand, is a bad idea, Dale Ho, the director of the Voting Rights Project at the A.C.L.U., argues in The Times. âWhile we should do everything we can to make voting accessible, the       Â     consensus of cybersecurity experts is that we are simply not prepared to ensure the security of online voting,â?he writes. âIn this case, the cure would be worse than the disease.â?Do you have a point of view we missed?

Bernardo from Maryland: âI am 80, I am not coughing or sneezing and have a stable body temperature.

However, if I have to go out to buy something I cannot avoid someone getting closer than six feet.

2020/3/19,How Are We Supposed to Vote During a Pandemic?,OPINION,"Scores of Times staff members worked to present the stories of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals who are risking everything to care for Covid-19 patients.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together.
The stress is all consuming. Intubating patients, administering CPR, even just breathing the same air as the stricken. Then there are the tears: from the sick, their families, their colleagues. Next patient. Next after next after next.
For the health care workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic, the strain comes in an unrelenting wave of nexts. Across the globe, they live with exhaustion, fear even guilt â?without âbeginning or end,â?one nurse said.
To understand the sacrifices of doctors, nurses and other professionals caring for Covid-19 patients, The Times invited them to share their stories in their own words. Their selected accounts and photographs have been published as a developing special collection, âIn Harm's Way.â?Online, readers can view the interactive collage of 135 faces â?some masked, others marked by protective gear, trenching story maps across their skin. Some of the profiles appear in today's print newspaper, with more to be published on Mondays in the coming weeks.
Early on, editors recognized the experiences of health care workers âwould be like no one else's,â?said Sam Dolnick, an assistant managing editor, who launched the project with the deputy managing editor Steve Duenes. âAnd a visual, global gallery seemed the best way to capture their stories.â?Ultimately, that gallery would include the work of more than 65 editors, developers, photographers, reporters and researchers. To date, it has garnered more than 600 responses. Catrin Einhorn, a reporter and senior staff editor, and Clinton Cargill, assistant national editor, shepherded the effort. âWe wanted to bring readers inside the world of health care workers,â?Ms. Einhorn said, âboth inside the physical hospitals and inside their emotional lives.â?Becky Lebowitz Hanger, the photographers' chief, worked with photographers across the globe to seek out candidates, take portraits and invite them to contribute.
Narratives from Salina, Kan., to Feroz Koh, Afghanistan, reflect the emotional turmoil medical professionals endure every day. Saving lives. Bearing witness. Saying final goodbyes.
Daniel Akinyemi, an intensive care nurse who lives in Montclair, N.J., sang âBlue Bayouâ?to an ailing female patient â?her favorite song. Claudio Del Monte, a chaplain in Bergamo, Italy, layered his gloves so that he could still hold patients' hands, telling them, âdon't be afraid.â?Becky Williams, a paramedic in San Bernardino, Calif., loaded an 88-year-old man with a 103.9-degree fever into an ambulance, while a family member quickly called his loved ones. âThe family members are telling him on speaker phone, 'We love you, Pop Pop â?we're praying for you, Pop Pop,' over and over as fast as they can,â?she recalled.
The senior audience editor Sona Patel helped craft the questions health care workers filled out online. (Among them: âTell us about the most intense experience you have had fighting Covid-19.â?âHow has being a health care professional during the Covid crisis changed you?â? The team sent the callout in English and Spanish.
âThe conversation was always around the idea that health care workers were really thrust into this front line position, which is not how we typically think of their work,â?Mr. Cargill, the assistant national editor, said. âSo we wanted to delve into the sense of identity that people feel in these roles and how working against the coronavirus has impacted that identity.â?Aidan Gardiner, a news assistant, has so far combed through 517 submissions â?confirming every person's identity â?and âthey keep coming in,â?he said.
Working from home, editors parsed through stories to identify unrepresented locations; reporters across the globe filled in gaps and conducted additional interviews in heavy-struck cities and countries. Jonathan Ellis, an editor on loan from the Politics desk, played a prominent role finding medical professionals, interviewing subjects and editing accounts.
From her laptop at her dining room table, the graphics and multimedia editor Rebecca Lieberman designed the digital presentation. She sought to achieve a âdelicate dance between the form and the content,â?she said, aiming to âgive readers that sense of scale but also allow them to meander the content, consuming a lot of stories without having to do a lot of work clicking or swiping.â?The result is that âyou can get lost in the piece,â?Mr. Gardiner said. âAnd, in that way, feel the enormity of this moment.â?Since the initial online publication on May 4, the team has received some 160 additional entries. Submissions will remain open during the pandemic, and the design may evolve as the project builds. Reporters and editors also plan to follow up with some of the featured medical professionals.
âHopefully we are signaling to health care workers that we really want to tell their stories,â?Ms. Patel, the senior audience editor, said. âThis is a two-way thing. It's not the last time that we'll connect with them.â?If you are a health care worker and would like to share your story, you can do so here.

2020/5/11,Voices From the Pandemic's Front Lines Times Insider,READER-CENTER,"Vaccinated residents who had embraced a return to some normalcy are unsettled: âIt's scary â?it feels like we've been here before.â?Holiday plans abruptly reversing, restaurants closing, Broadway shows going dark while, blocks away, long lines form outside testing sites â?it's as if it were 2020 all over again.
The startling rise in coronavirus infections has whiplashed New York City and the surrounding region. Once more, most everyone seems to know someone who is infected.
Millions of people who have followed the city's guidelines and received two or even three vaccination shots, who have in recent weeks and months enjoyed a return to many of their old practices â?riding the subway, dining indoors, partying with friends â?face an uncertain future.
âIt's scary â?it feels like we've been here before,â?said Emma Clippinger, 36, waiting in a long line outside a testing site in Fort Greene, Brooklyn, on Thursday. âIt feels like last year, last winter, despite the vaccines and despite the boosters, and it's the same game plan, but it also feels like we get defeated often.â?New York City and the surrounding Northeast, the epicenter of the coronavirus's arrival in 2020, is being buffeted by a new surge in infections that seems poised to disrupt the long awaited return to normalcy. New case reports in New York State have skyrocketed nearly 60 percent in the last two weeks.
âIt is clear that the Omicron variant is here in New York City in full force,â?Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Thursday.
Deidre Depke, 59, waiting in line for a test on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, didn't need the mayor to tell her. âMonday I wasn't even thinking about it,â?she said, âand Thursday I'm in a panic.â?An average of more than 10,600 infections were being identified each day in New York State, more than any other state, and hospitalizations were also increasing, although more slowly. The city's test positivity rate doubled in just three days, up to 7.8 percent on Sunday compared with 3.9 percent the previous Thursday, raising alarm bells among city officials and residents alike.
The number of new cases reported statewide on Thursday alone â?18,276, more than 8,300 of them in New York City â?was the highest since at least January. Hospitalizations, though, remain at a fraction of what they were in the city's deadly first virus wave, with about 1,000 people hospitalized in New York City now, compared to more than 15,000 at the peak in April 2020.
It remains unknown to what extent Omicron will cause serious illness. Scientists believe that vaccines will still provide protection against the worst outcomes, and boosters are likely to provide additional protection against infection, preliminary data suggests.
The public health picture in other states was also growing bleaker. Connecticut is averaging more than 2,600 new cases a day, up from about 330 at the start of November, and Rhode Island is adding cases at the highest rate in the nation. Michigan, Indiana, Ohio and Pennsylvania have the highest rates of coronavirus hospitalizations.
In Rhode Island, Dr. Wilfredo Giordano-Perez, who sits on the governor's vaccine committee, said the number of people scaling back holiday plans still seemed fairly small. âI wish I was hearing more of that,â?he said. âI think people are going to take their chances, with this idea that they've done everything they can do up until this point.â?In New York, Mayor de Blasio announced six steps to address the surge, including expanding the hours and capacity of testing sites, distributing one million free KN95 masks and 500,000 home tests through community organizations, stepping up enforcement of mask and vaccine mandates at businesses and encouraging more New Yorkers to get boosters.
Only 1.5 million New Yorkers, or about 22 percent of adults, have gotten either a booster or an additional dose, according to city statistics. Meanwhile, 82 percent of adult New Yorkers are fully vaccinated.
âWe have seen a very substantial increase in Covid cases in the last few days,â?Mr. de Blasio said on Thursday.
âPeople need to get vaccinated right now, get that booster right now,â?he added. âIf they are not feeling well, get tested right now. It's an urgent situation.â?At-home testing kits, piled high just weeks ago with shoppers showing little interest, are selling out at some stores. The governor's office on Thursday announced plans to create a system for residents to request that coronavirus tests be sent to their homes.
With a new year approaching, many corners of the city seemed to be sliding backward. Some restaurants have had to shut their doors, not because the city forced them to but because their staff members tested positive or were exposed to the virus, and there was no one to replace them.
Many Broadway shows, so soon after their celebrated return in September, have once again gone dark for limited stretches, often with hours' notice, as cast or crew members test positive.
New York University canceled all ânonessentialâ?gatherings, from holiday parties to graduation ceremonies, and strongly advised that finals be moved online. Cornell University declared a Code Red on its Ithaca, N.Y., campus, after more than 900 community members tested positive in a week, despite near-perfect vaccination rates. Companies have called off everything from Midtown Manhattan holiday parties to return-to-office timetables and in-person meetings.
Corporations including Citigroup and Apple are asking employees to work from home. JPMorgan Chase moved a January health care conference to online, while Goldman Sachs urged workers to cancel holiday parties.
New rules affect everyone â?even the audiences for the Rockettes. The city will be sending inspectors to Radio City Music Hall and other venues to make sure that they are checking vaccination cards among children as young as 5, who need one dose of vaccine to attend indoor shows.
Gov. Kathy Hochul addressed the matter at a news conference Thursday. âWe're asking people to follow common sense. Get vaccinated, get boosted. Please don't take a chance,â?she said. âPeople have a right to stay alive, and the people that you affect have a right to live as well.â?Even though data has suggested that the unvaccinated remain most at risk, that was little comfort to vaccinated New Yorkers, watching the plans they'd waited so long to make evaporate as even vaccinated people test positive in breakthrough cases.
âIt's literally all I've been thinking about,â?said Sarah Gancher, a teacher at the New School, sitting in Madison Square Park with a bag of at-home testing kits she had just purchased. She said eight of her fully vaccinated friends had tested positive this week. âI'm really heartsick and worried. This to me feels like the day Broadway shut down, again.â?The old threat calculations surrounding family and friends are back: Do I go or do I stay home? Who else will be there, and are they at greater risk? Are they vaccinated â?and does that really matter?
Ms. Clippinger's holiday plans in the city, including her mother's visit from Boston, are shifting beneath her feet.
âMy mom is probably going to make her visit very short, just to kiss everyone and then go back to her partner,â?she said. âIn the past it would have been museums and Broadway, and eating at all of our favorite restaurants â?not this year.â?Meera Ilahi, 22, took a test on Thursday after several of her friends attended the raucous, generally maskless Santa Con bar crawl on Saturday â?even though she did not.
âI'm kind of nervous because a lot of people I know who went out this weekend are testing positive,â?she said as she waited to learn her own results. âAnd then on TikTok, I've been scrolling and like, every video I kept getting was like, 'I am in New York, and I have Covid.'â?The news brought to the fore familiar insecurities from the start of the pandemic. âI'm worried about financial stress, mostly,â?said Tristan Ramirez, a 23-year-old Washington Heights resident waiting for a test at the subway station on 72nd and Broadway. âIf I get sick and have to take a lot of time off, I'm not going to get paid.â?Vivienne Taylor, 62, a Queens resident, waited in a testing line hours before her scheduled flight to her hometown in Jamaica on Thursday evening. The airport and journey would be her last public outings for the time being, she said.
âI'm not going to be complacent,â?Ms. Taylor said. âI'm going to go home, I'm going to stay home and just keep to myself.â?The fatigue of the pandemic â?the worrying, then relief, then more worrying, and more masks â?reaches all the way to the governor's office, as Ms. Hochul made clear on Thursday. She was asked when it would all end, and she took a deep breath, rubbed her hands together and looked skyward before answering with a seemingly forced smile.
âThere is no person on this earth who can give an answer to the question, 'When will this end?'â?she said. âNor can I.â?Reporting was contributed by Grace Ashford, Sophie Kasakove, Emma G. Fitzsimmons, Joseph Goldstein and Mitch Smith.

Readers responded by letter and at nytimes.com to Ginia Bellafante's column last Sunday about Joe Joyce, a Brooklyn man who died of Covid-19 more than three weeks after returning from a Mediterranean cruise. Comments have been edited.   I am so sorry for this entire family; what an avoidable tragedy. That said, my spouse and I are the same age as Mr. Joyce, but in true role reversal, we listen to our children. When our grown son instructed us we were not to go to a large party in mid-March, we took his demand seriously. When our daughter said we needed to stay out of public places except for essentials, we took her admonition to heart. We have been wearing masks and gloves for five weeks now, and will continue to do so until a vaccine is available. And we will not gather in groups even if everyone we know is doing so; especially if everyone we know is doing so.

  This was the most inspiring, educational, upbeat, succinct, joyous, yet tragic story I've ever read. I wish it could be shared with the millions of nonreaders getting their only news from TV or phone apps. I salute the writer for her superb piece and The Times for making it available. You've given yet another reason to read a quality newspaper.

  I just learned that a high school friend and his wife returned from European vacation and got trapped for four hours in the immigration pile up on March 14. He went to the E.R. on March 18. No tests. He died in the E.R. on March 20 while they were intubating him as his wife waited outside. He wasn't tested. Think of how many haven't been counted.

  This story breaks my heart. But I know all too well how a person who is otherwise compassionate and educated can become trapped in the Fox/Trump bubble of lies, distortion and misinformation.
  My mother, an intelligent and educated woman, 88 years of age, is an avid Fox watcher. She was calling the virus ''hype'' and a ''hoax'' -- until Fox and Trump realized the virus was upon us and changed their tune, claiming they knew all along how bad it was. Now she is on board with that. She simply parrots whatever the current propaganda is being pushed by Fox or Trump. It's all so sad.

  I am very sorry for his family. I just worked a flight from Florida to an East Coast city. There were about 30 passengers onboard, and most were wearing masks. Ironically the passengers who were not wearing masks seemed to be over 60 years old. I did wonder in what different worlds we must live in to travel in an enclosed space at this point without a thought of protecting yourself and others during this time.

  Certain established news media have longstanding reputation for being liberal-biased, which over time has undermined their credibility, and triggered the rise of right-biased outlets that in addition to political bias also relay egregious misinformation. Perhaps if every news outlet strove to be objective and unbiased -- isn't that the intent of journalism? -- then maybe we wouldn't have these issues.
  George Eliot, Connecticut
  I'm an R.N. working in I.C.U. while we struggle through caring for our patients both Covid and non-Covid. I feel for this man and his family, friends and all those he included into his world. I hope articles like this reach other families who struggle with relatives and friends who are skeptical of this deadly virus. I applaud his children who tried to help their dad trust the science and avoid the misinformation from the president's administration. I worry that my college's and my family's sacrifices will be in vain if the average American doesn't support our efforts to conserve our limited resources and try to save lives. America is asking so much from us and we are willing to serve but please, please, please, keep us safer by following the C.D.C. guidelines and avoiding these harmful and deadly moguls/politicians who are leading us down a terrible path.

  This is heartbreaking, but I'm afraid there will be too many more stories like this before the end of the pandemic. My condolences go out to this family.

2020/4/26,Reader Comments,Section MB; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 3,"Carrie Lam, the territory's chief executive, said Monday that she would not seek a second term. Her tenure was marked by protests, a contentious law and a devastating Covid outbreak.
HONG KONG â?Under the watch of Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, huge citywide protests deepened political divisions. A national security law silenced a once-vibrant civil society. And restrictive pandemic policies threatened Hong Kong's status as Asia's world city.
With each crisis, Mrs. Lam tried to serve the will of Beijing, which controls the territory, and navigate competing pressures from residents and an international community leery of China's growing authoritarian grip over Hong Kong.
On Monday, those pressures appeared to boil over as Mrs. Lam announced that she would not seek a second five-year term, marking the end of one of the most tumultuous periods of governance in Hong Kong's recent history.
Mrs. Lam cited her family as the reason for her plans, saying that they were her priority and that âthey think it is time for me to go back home.â?But for some of her critics, it was Mrs. Lam's failure to guide the city through a devastating coronavirus outbreak that was her final undoing.
In recent weeks, Mrs. Lam, 64, has faced rebuke from Hong Kong residents, pro-Beijing lawmakers and the city's powerful business community for mishandling an Omicron outbreak that has ravaged hospitals, nursing homes and public services. The surge laid bare the city's lack of preparedness as it struggled to deal with more than a million cases and over 8,000 deaths in just the past couple of months alone.
But even before the pandemic, there was mounting criticism of Mrs. Lam.
Once known in the Hong Kong Civil Service, where she began her career 42 years ago, as a âgood fighterâ?who never backed down, Mrs. Lam has struggled as chief executive to navigate Hong Kong's unique relationship with Beijing.
Hong Kong, a former British colony, was promised partial autonomy when it was returned to China in 1997. But its democratic traditions have often been at odds with Beijing. Mrs. Lam has mostly erred on the side of seeking approval from Chinese officials, who have been accused of redefining the âone country, two systemsâ?framework that was agreed upon as part of the handover.
The system was meant to allow Hong Kong to maintain some freedoms distinct from the mainland.
âShe has been one of the key actors who have buried 'one country, two systems' as we understood it in the first 25 years of the handover,â?said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist at Hong Kong Baptist University.
To many in Hong Kong, it appears that Mrs. Lam has done little to respond to the growing frustrations among residents during the pandemic, failing to change rigid coronavirus policies after a fast-moving outbreak tore through the city's world-class hospital system and further isolated Hong Kong from other countries.
Two years into the pandemic, many of those policies have contributed to widespread unemployment and the shuttering of thousands of small businesses.
âIt seems that the government is very removed from the lives of everyday people, and can't seem to gauge how the policies they introduce would make our lives difficult,â?Carmen Chan, a 45-year-old office worker in the Wan Chai commercial district, said Monday.
Ms. Chan said she had been disappointed by Mrs. Lam's administration and was somewhat relieved to hear that she would not seek another term.
Mrs. Lam became chief executive in July 2017 after pledging her loyalty to Beijing and promising to foster a stronger sense of Chinese identity among young Hong Kong residents. But deepening polarization of Hong Kong society two years later left her the target of huge street protests in 2019. Demonstrators demanded her resignation over an extradition bill that would allow the city to detain and transfer people to mainland China.
The bill was met with strong opposition and demonstrations that lasted months.
In the wake of the protests, Beijing imposed a sweeping new national security law over Hong Kong. It also drastically revamped election rules, giving pro-Beijing lawmakers even greater power to choose the city's top leader and members of its legislature.
Foreign politicians were openly critical of the new law. The United States imposed sanctions on Mrs. Lam and other senior officials, and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state at the time, pledged that the United States would âtreat Hong Kong as 'one country, one system.'â?Mrs. Lam referred to the protests, as well as the coronavirus and ânonstop interference of foreign forces,â?as contributing to her decision to step down on Monday.
âI have faced unprecedented and enormous pressure,â?she said.
As Mrs. Lam rose through the Hong Kong Civil Service, first under British rule and later under Beijing, she became known for defending policy stances and refusing to back down from arguments. But over the past few months, as Hong Kong tried to hew to China's âzero Covidâ?policy, she was criticized as sending mixed signalsregarding how the city would manage the outbreak.
Hong Kong has some of the strictest travel restrictions in the world. Uncertainty over when those restrictions would end led to the largest exodus of residents since the beginning of the pandemic. While facing increased criticism from the city's business sector and expatriate community, Mrs. Lam doubled down on social distancing measures and an effort to make the city's 7.4 million people test for the virus, something that mainland epidemiologists had advised the city's government to do.
Mrs. Lam later backed away from mass testing. In late March, she said the city would lift a flight ban on nine countries and begin to relax restrictions, citing concerns that the financial sector was âlosing patienceâ?after officials indicated that the worst of the latest outbreak was most likely over.
âThe problem with the chief executive in Hong Kong is that you've got the left hand and the right hand,â?said Allan Zeman, an adviser to Mrs. Lam and a member of the election committee that will decide the city's next chief executive. âYou've got the international community on the one side, and China on the other hand, and you're in the middle. Both have different aspirations.â?Hong Kong has reported nearly 1.2 million Covid-19 cases and 8,262 deaths, most of them tied to the recent outbreak, and many of them among Hong Kong's older and unvaccinated population. The city's fatality rate from the virus was at one point among the highest in the world, at three per 100,000 residents, in large part because so many older people were not vaccinated, seen as an example of Mrs. Lam's failure to prepare for the outbreak.
âHer authority and ability to govern have been severely eroded,â?said Lau Siu-kai, a Hong Kong scholar who advises Beijing on policy, referring to her handling of the protests and pandemic. âHer departure will allow Beijing to form a new and more powerful team to attain a stronger and more effective government.â?Addressing speculation on Monday that Hong Kong's No. 2 official, John Lee, would be a favorite to replace her, Mrs. Lam said that she had yet to receive a resignation from any government officials, a precursor to making a bid for the job.
She also said that she would focus on pandemic-related work until the end of her term on June 30. On Saturday, government officials issued a statement exempting candidates for chief executive from some social distancing rules while campaigning.
Hong Kong's chief executive is determined every five years in a vote closely managed by Beijing and determined by an election committee made up of nearly 1,500 officials who back the Communist Party. The election was to take place on March 27, but was postponed until May 8 amid Hong Kong's Omicron surge.
With Mrs. Lam's announcement on Monday, questions about her desire for a second term were put to rest. But little else was certain beyond that. âPlans keep changing. Everything is unstable. I don't know who will be next. I hope it will get better,â?said Ms. Chan. âBut I don't really expect it to.â?Keith Bradsher contributed reporting.

2022/4/3,"With Each New Crisis in Hong Kong , Pressure Built on a Beijing Loyalist",WORLD; asia,"A Times examination of the host's career and singular influence at Fox News shows how his trajectory traces the transformation of American conservatism itself.
Night after night on Fox, Tucker Carlson weaponizes his viewers' fears and grievances to create what may be the most racist show in the history of cable news. It is also, by some measures, the most successful.
With singular influence â?reaching far beyond Fox and the viewers who tune in to his show â?Mr. Carlson has filled the vacuum left by Donald J. Trump, championing the former president's most ardent followers and some of their most extreme views. As fervently as he has raced to the defense of the Jan. 6 rioters, so has he sown doubt and suspicion around immigrants, Black Lives Matter protesters or Covid-19 vaccines.
A New York Times examination of Mr. Carlson's career, including interviews with dozens of friends and former colleagues, and an analysis of more than 1,100 episodes of his Fox program, shows how he has grown increasingly sympathetic to the nativist currents coursing through U.S. politics, and how intertwined his rise has been with the transformations of his network and of American conservatism.
Here are some key takeaways from âAmerican Nationalist,â?The Times's three-partÂ series on Mr. Carlson.
Years of talking points from the far-right fringe
Last spring, Mr. Carlson caused an uproar when he promoted on air the notion of the âgreat replacementâ?â?a racist conspiracy theory, once relegated to the far-right fringe, that Western elites are importing âobedientâ?immigrant voters to disempower the native-born. The Anti-Defamation League called for his firing, noting that such thinking had helped fuel a string of terrorist attacks.
But this was hardly something new for Mr. Carlson. In more than 400 episodes, the Times analysis found, he has amplified the idea that a cabal of elites want to force demographic change through immigration.
Mr. Carlson's producers often trawl the web for supporting material. In the show's early years, clips would sometimes be sent to the network's fact checkers, who would occasionally discover that a story had actually originated farther afield, on a racist or neo-Nazi site like Stormfront.
In a statement, Justin Wells, a senior executive producer overseeing Mr. Carlson's show, defended the host's rhetoric and choice of topics: âTucker Carlson programming embraces diversity of thought and presents various points of view in an industry where contrarian thought and the search for truth are often ignored.â?He put Trumpism over Trump
In the White House, Mr. Trump had a symbiotic relationship with Fox: watching, tweeting, talking frequently to the network's hosts. But that presented Mr. Carlson with a programming problem as his new show ascended to Fox's marquee 8 p.m. time slot: He wanted to reach the Trump base, he told friends and co-workers, but without being beholden to the mercurial president. The solution: embrace Trumpism, not Mr. Trump.
The show would grasp the emotional core of Mr. Trump's allure â?white panic over the country's changing ethnic composition â?while keeping a carefully measured distance from the president. Mr. Carlson sometimes even criticized the president, and in private, he mocked Mr. Trump's habit of phoning to head off on-air attacks.
He sought out stories, one friend observed, that were sometimes âreally weirdâ?and often inaccurate but tapped into viewers' fears of a trampled-on American culture. He inveighed against Macy's, for instance, for introducing a line of hijabs, likening it to promoting genital mutilation.
As Tucker goes, so goes Fox
Mr. Carlson forged a relationship with Lachlan Murdoch, heir apparent of the Fox empire, and cultivated a perception within the network that the two men were close. As his show became the highest-rated cable news program in prime time, Fox looked to its success as a model for a broader transformation.
Inside the network, journalists and commentators clashed over what many saw as a creeping invasion of the news division by allies of the higher-rated, pro-Trump prime-time hosts.
While Mr. Murdoch and Fox executives have  often couched their defense of  âTucker Carlson Tonightâ?as a protection of free inquiry and controversial opinions, Mr. Carlson's on-air provocations have long been something else: part of a painstaking, data-driven experiment that has succeeded wildly in bolstering Fox's profit machine against the long-term decline in cable news subscriptions.
According to three former Fox employees, Mr. Carlson was among the network's most avid consumers of what are known as minute-by-minutes â?ratings data on an audience's real-time ebb and flow. âHe is going to double down on the white nationalism because the minute-by-minutes show that the audience eats it up,â?said a former employee who worked frequently with Mr. Carlson.
Network executives soon began applying the approach to the daytime news shows. They pitched it as âMoneyballâ?for television: an audience-first approach to deciding what to cover and how to cover it.
Journalists on Fox's daytime shows discerned a pattern to what the audience didn't like: segments featuring Fox's own reporters, stories deemed unfavorable to Mr. Trump, left-leaning or independent guests. Immigration, on the other hand, was a hit.
Network executives ordered up so much coverage of illegal immigrants or nonwhite Americans caught in acts of crime or violence that some employees referred to it by a grim nickname: âbrown menace.â?Dismay and dissent within the network
A string of segments in 2018 about the gruesome murders of farmers in South Africa, which Mr. Carlson suggested were part of a campaign by that country's Black-led government to seize white-owned land, sparked a rare high-level dispute inside Fox.
Brian Jones, then the president of Fox Business Network and the highest-ranking Black man in Fox leadership, explained to senior executives that Mr. Carlson's coverage had been ripped from far-right sites, and that almost everything Mr. Carlson was saying on air was wrong. But Mr. Jones was overruled, and the coverage continued. Mr. Trump tweeted that his administration would âclosely studyâ?the seizure of white-owned land and the âlarge-scale killing of farmers.â?Alt-right and neo-Nazi figures cheered the propaganda coup.
Later that year, Fox journalists discovered another reason for concern. An organizational chart loaded into the company's new employee portal showed a controversial figure named Peter Brimelow â?founder of the nativist website VDare â?reporting directly to Rupert Murdoch. Employees who asked about his apparent role at Fox were told that Mr. Brimelow was helping with Mr. Murdoch's memoirs â?a project that most people thought their boss had abandoned in the 1990s â?or writing speeches, or attached to some other Murdoch initiative. The chart soon disappeared. A Fox spokeswoman said Mr. Brimelow did not currently have any relationship with the company.
Going after his critics
Mr. Carlson's popularity among viewers has allowed him to fend off critics outside Fox and shut down those within, from news anchors to junior employees who have objected to his rhetoric.
After an on-air feud with Mr. Carlson in 2019 over the impeachment inquiry and Mr. Trump's efforts to pressure Ukrainian officials, Shepard Smith was reportedly warned against criticizing his fellow host. He departed Fox that October.
After a Fox producer, Dan Gallo, expressed concerns to human resources executives about recordings of Mr. Carlson defending statutory rape and calling Iraqis âsemiliterate primitive monkeys,â?and on-air comments by Jeanine Pirro questioning a Muslim congresswoman's loyalty to the Constitution, Mr. Carlson learned about his complaints and confronted him face to face in Los Angeles, demanding that Mr. Gallo âdo the honorable thingâ?and call him if he had a disagreement. Mr. Gallo offered to talk then and there, but Mr. Carlson wasn't interested. âI'm busy,â?the host said, and walked off.
Days after a mass shooting in El Paso by a white man protesting what he called the âHispanic invasion of Texas,â?Mr. Carlson declared that white supremacy was largely a âhoax.â?A young Fox reporter, Cristina Corbin, tweeted, without mentioning Mr. Carlson: âWhite supremacy is real, as evidenced by fact. Claims that it is a 'hoax' do not represent my views.â?The host called Ms. Corbin and yelled at her to âshut your mouth,â?according to a former Fox executive briefed on the episode. When asked about the incident by Fox management, Mr. Carlson denied making the call.
His playbook sent sponsors fleeing, yet nearly doubled ad dollars
Here is the âTucker Carlson Tonightâ?playbook: Go straight for the third rail, be it race, immigration or another hot-button issue; harvest the inevitable backlash; return the next evening to skewer critics for how they responded. Then, do it all again. This feedback loop drove up ratings and boosted loyalty to Fox and Mr. Carlson.
What it did not do was endear Mr. Carlson to advertisers. As blue-chip sponsors fled, Fox filled the space with in-house promos â?using Mr. Carlson's popularity to push other Fox shows â?and direct-to-consumer brands like MyPillow, whose chief executive is a major promoter of Mr. Trump's stolen-election lie.
Last May, after promoting the white supremacist âreplacementâ?theory, Mr. Carlson had half as many advertisers as in December 2018. But he brought in almost twice as much money.

The S&P 500 rose 0.2 percent after another wobbly day of trading. Nearly three-fourths of the companies in the benchmark index notched gains, including energy stocks, which rose along with the price of crude oil. Health care was the only sector to fall. 
  After a stumbling start to the week, stocks have been moving higher on the back of strong earnings and better-than-expected economic data.
  Traders got a dose of decent economic news Wednesday when the Labor Department said that consumer prices rose 0.5 percent from June to July, down from the previous monthly increase of 0.9 percent. Year over year, consumer prices have increased a substantial 5.4 percent.
  Investors' relief that the June data didn't show a bigger increase in inflation may have kept stock prices moving higher, said Sam Stovall, chief investment strategist at CFRA.
  ''Our estimate was that June was going to be the peak month in inflation, and it appears that it was,'' Mr. Stovall said.
  The S&P 500 index rose 10.95 points to 4,447.70. The Dow gained 220.30 points, or 0.6 percent, to 35,484.97. Both indexes also set record highs on Friday and Tuesday.
  Weakness in some technology stocks helped pull the Nasdaq composite slightly lower. It fell 22.95 points, or 0.2 percent, to 14,765.14.
  Smaller company stocks rose. The Russell 2000 index picked up 10.98 points, or 0.5 percent, to 2,250.34.
  Bond yields mostly edged lower.
  Investors' concerns about inflation and uncertainty about the Federal Reserve's future plans to ease up on its support for low interest rates have been hanging over the market.
  While the headline figures may seem bad, most of the rise in consumer prices has been tied to very specific goods that are not expected to affect the long-term health of the economy, like used cars, building materials and hotel rooms. These items have been in short supply during the pandemic, and the increased economic activity has made prices for those items rise faster than usual.
  The Federal Reserve has repeatedly said it believes any increase in inflation would be temporary and largely a result of the supply disruptions that happened because of the pandemic. Investors will get another inflation snapshot Thursday, when the Labor Department issues its July wholesale price data.
  Banks made some of the strongest gains Wednesday after bond yields initially edged higher, which benefits lenders because it allows them to charge higher interest on loans. Bank of America rose 1.3 percent.
  Industrial stocks also helped lift the market. United Rentals climbed 5 percent for one of the biggest gains in the S&P 500.
  Traders had a mix of earnings and corporate news to review. Coinbase, a platform where traders can buy and sell digital currencies like Bitcoin, rose 3.2 percent after reporting strong growth in the last quarter.
  Shares of the weight-loss program operator WW International plunged 24.6 percent after the company reported disappointing second-quarter financial results, while shares of the hamburger chain Wendy's rose 3.7 percent after the company raised its profit forecast for the year and increased its dividend.
  NortonLifeLock stock rose $2.10 to $26.25. The security software maker is buying Avast for up to $8.6 billion.
  Shares of Pfizer dropped $1.88 to $46.31. European regulators are reportedly looking into newly observed potential side effects from Covid-19 vaccines.

2021/8/12,"Indexes Waver, Then Turn Mostly Higher",Section B; Column 0; Business/Financial Desk; Pg. 2,"Scores of Times staff members worked to present the stories of doctors, nurses and other health care professionals who are risking everything to care for Covid-19 patients.
Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together. 
  The stress is all consuming. Intubating patients, administering CPR, even just breathing the same air as the stricken. Then there are the tears: from the sick, their families, their colleagues. Next patient. Next after next after next.
  For the health care workers on the front lines of the coronavirus pandemic, the strain comes in an unrelenting wave of nexts. Across the globe, they live with exhaustion, fear even guilt -- without ''beginning or end,'' one nurse said.
  To understand the sacrifices of doctors, nurses and other professionals caring for Covid-19 patients, The Times invited them to share their stories in their own words. Their selected accounts and photographs have been published as a developing special collection, ''In Harm's Way.''
  Online, readers can view the interactive collage of 135 faces -- some masked, others marked by protective gear, trenching story maps across their skin. Some of the profiles appear in today's print newspaper, with more to be published on Mondays in the coming weeks.
  Early on, editors recognized the experiences of health care workers ''would be like no one else's,'' said Sam Dolnick, an assistant managing editor, who launched the project with the deputy managing editor Steve Duenes. ''And a visual, global gallery seemed the best way to capture their stories.''
  Ultimately, that gallery would include the work of more than 65 editors, developers, photographers, reporters and researchers. To date, it has garnered more than 600 responses. Catrin Einhorn, a reporter and senior staff editor, and Clinton Cargill, assistant national editor, shepherded the effort. ''We wanted to bring readers inside the world of health care workers,'' Ms. Einhorn said, ''both inside the physical hospitals and inside their emotional lives.''
  Becky Lebowitz Hanger, the photographers' chief, worked with photographers across the globe to seek out candidates, take portraits and invite them to contribute.
  Narratives from Salina, Kan., to Feroz Koh, Afghanistan, reflect the emotional turmoil medical professionals endure every day. Saving lives. Bearing witness. Saying final goodbyes.
  Daniel Akinyemi, an intensive care nurse who lives in Montclair, N.J., sang ''Blue Bayou'' to an ailing female patient -- her favorite song. Claudio Del Monte, a chaplain in Bergamo, Italy, layered his gloves so that he could still hold patients' hands, telling them, ''don't be afraid.''
  Becky Williams, a paramedic in San Bernardino, Calif., loaded an 88-year-old man with a 103.9-degree fever into an ambulance, while a family member quickly called his loved ones. ''The family members are telling him on speaker phone, 'We love you, Pop Pop -- we're praying for you, Pop Pop,' over and over as fast as they can,'' she recalled.
  The senior audience editor Sona Patel helped craft the questions health care workers filled out online. (Among them: ''Tell us about the most intense experience you have had fighting Covid-19.'' ''How has being a health care professional during the Covid crisis changed you?'') The team sent the callout in English and Spanish.
  ''The conversation was always around the idea that health care workers were really thrust into this front line position, which is not how we typically think of their work,'' Mr. Cargill, the assistant national editor, said. ''So we wanted to delve into the sense of identity that people feel in these roles and how working against the coronavirus has impacted that identity.''
  Aidan Gardiner, a news assistant, has so far combed through 517 submissions -- confirming every person's identity -- and ''they keep coming in,'' he said.
  Working from home, editors parsed through stories to identify unrepresented locations; reporters across the globe filled in gaps and conducted additional interviews in heavy-struck cities and countries. Jonathan Ellis, an editor on loan from the Politics desk, played a prominent role finding medical professionals, interviewing subjects and editing accounts.
  From her laptop at her dining room table, the graphics and multimedia editor Rebecca Lieberman designed the digital presentation. She sought to achieve a ''delicate dance between the form and the content,'' she said, aiming to ''give readers that sense of scale but also allow them to meander the content, consuming a lot of stories without having to do a lot of work clicking or swiping.''
  The result is that ''you can get lost in the piece,'' Mr. Gardiner said. ''And, in that way, feel the enormity of this moment.''
  Since the initial online publication on May 4, the team has received some 160 additional entries. Submissions will remain open during the pandemic, and the design may evolve as the project builds. Reporters and editors also plan to follow up with some of the featured medical professionals.
  ''Hopefully we are signaling to health care workers that we really want to tell their stories,'' Ms. Patel, the senior audience editor, said. ''This is a two-way thing. It's not the last time that we'll connect with them.''

2020/5/11,Voices From the Pandemic's Front Lines,Section A; Column 0; Metropolitan Desk; Pg. 2; TIMES INSIDER,"In this week's column, Sarah Firshein investigates the ever-changing refund policies offered by travel companies.
Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. For the latest updates, read The New York Times's Covid-19 coverage here.
Dear Tripped Up,
Last September I booked a Japan tour with Abercrombie &amp; Kent, scheduled to leave at the end of March. Three tickets came to more than $46,000, without airfare. What happens when you book your dream trip, only to confront travel restrictions and an exploding global pandemic? Nancy
Dear Nancy,
Last September, around the time you must have been booking your Japan trip, I took my first-ever surfing lesson in Barbados. Bobbing in the gentle, beginner-friendly bay, I learned the sport is all about timing: If you can't get ahead of the wave, you'll end up watching it thunder ashore without you.
The same goes for writing about travel amid the daily-changing coronavirus pandemic.
My original response to your question, which had been scheduled for the third week of March, included a detailed run-down about how tour operators work. I spoke to Abercrombie &amp; Kent and even got you a credit â?yes, the full $46,000.
The day the column was set to go to print, Abercrombie &amp; Kent announced it was suspending all of its tours until (at least) the end of April. Its new, more flexible policies would have given you a $46,000 credit anyway. Much of what I wrote no longer applied, and to run it wouldn't have been fair. I've never been so happy to see one of my own pieces get âkilled.â?Since the end of January, when the World Health Organization declared the coronavirus outbreak a public health emergency (six weeks before the term pandemic was applied), scores of Times readers have come forward with questions like yours. Then came three tectonic shifts in rapid succession: President Trump suspending travel from Europe for a month, the State Department issuing its highest travel advisory (Level 4, or âDo Not Travelâ?, and countries all around the world closing their borders.
The travel industry scrambled to keep up. Caveats and exclusions disappeared from cancellation and change policies â?even for airlines, which can be notoriously difficult. The cruise industry, after stammering with a full range of responses, finally threw in the towel and outright suspended sailings for a month. Tour operators like Abercrombie &amp; Kent fell in line, too.
In turn, I was barraged by readers requesting tips and advice about one thing: refunds.
Take the two emails I received about flying on Norwegian Air. One reader asked how to get a refund for tickets on a flight that was still headed to Rome, despite the then-burgeoning coronavirus outbreak in Italy. The other questioned the airline's $110 change fee on a flight that happened to be departing New York City for Oslo the very day the Norwegian government closed the border.
By the time I traded emails with a Norwegian Air spokesman, the airline was no longer flying from the United States to Rome or Oslo, and it had eliminated its change fees altogether.
Looking for a Refund? Here are 4 Takeaways.
    â?Be patient; the travel industry is scrambling to keep up with the tectonic shifts in travel restrictions.
    â?As a result, customer service centers are also scrambling. Expect long wait and response times.
    â?If your trip isn't right around the corner, it's best to wait to cancel it â?especially if you don't need to immediately access the funds.
    â?It's in everyone's best interest to be flexible right now.
Another reader emailed to tell me about a denied refund on two Airbnbs in Spain: âThis experience is making me question whether it's a good idea to use them in the future,â?she wrote.
Airbnb announced a sweeping extenuating-circumstances cancellation policy five days later. I had only cursorily reached out to the company when a followup from the reader landed in my inbox: âAirbnb emailed me today and promised a refund would be coming in the next 15 days.â?But it was the exchange I had with Priceline that best illustrated the travel industry's high-speed reaction of the evolving pandemic.
A reader named Bonnie emailed to say that Priceline had charged her a $518 fee when she canceled her April stay at a hotel in San Francisco. Meanwhile, the hotel itself was waiving cancellation fees.
When I reached out to Priceline, I learned that on March 16 â?the day Bonnie canceled her reservation online â?the hotel's cancellation waiver had been communicated to all of Priceline's phone agents but had yet to be uploaded into the database that processes online cancellations. In other words, Bonnie had beaten Priceline to its own rush.
That technical lag has since been fixed, and Bonnie's cancellation fee was refunded. A Priceline spokesman emailed, âPlease know that this was NOT her mistake â?this was ours entirely. We're also very sorry that it took several days for her to get the right answers. It's obviously a very busy time in travel, but when we learn about errors like these, we'll fix them immediately.â?The situation also drives home a point that Jack Ezon, the founder of the luxury travel agency Embark, stressed when I called him a few weeks ago to get his perspective about the coronavirus's general effect on the industry: âIt's in everyone's best interest to be flexible right now.â?Flexible cancellation and change policies foster goodwill and are an overall boon for their images. But they're also good for cash flow and long-term brand loyalty: the famous âbird in the handâ?adage, said Mr. Ezon. âIf you want to entice people to buy, you need to make it easy for them to cancel,â?he said.
But combine panicked consumers seeking refunds en masse, all-but-guaranteed customer-service logjams, and cancellation and change policies that have changed â?often drastically â?in a matter of weeks, and we're back in that water, attempting to time those waves just right.
My reporting on the coronavirus so far has pointed to one key lesson: if your trip isn't right around the corner, it's best to wait to cancel it, especially if you don't need to immediately access the funds. Look no further than my parents' planned trip to Japan. In late February, when they lobbied All Nippon Airways for a refund on two round-trip business class tickets from New York City to Tokyo, they got a paltry offer: a $463 credit (total). Instead they held off, refreshing the airline's website a few times a week until their late-April departure date was finally covered by the airline's ballooning cancellation policy.
Not only does the wait-and-see strategy save you from having to spend hours on hold, but, as the experiences above indicate, jumping in prematurely â?say, before policies are officially hammered out â?almost always guarantees a headache. There's a philosophical upside to this, as well, especially for those of us who are used to having trips on the calendar. It's unlikely I'll get to Menorca in September, but my not-yet-canceled hotel reservation is a small token of normalcy â?my own tiny show of optimism.

2020/4/15,Help! The Coronavirus Struck and I Want a Refund Tripped Up,TRAVEL,"Carrie Lam, the territory's chief executive, said Monday that she would not seek a second term. Her tenure was marked by protests, a contentious law and a devastating Covid outbreak.
HONG KONG -- Under the watch of Carrie Lam, Hong Kong's chief executive, huge citywide protests deepened political divisions. A national security law silenced a once-vibrant civil society. And restrictive pandemic policies threatened Hong Kong's status as Asia's world city. 
  With each crisis, Mrs. Lam tried to serve the will of Beijing, which controls the territory, and navigate competing pressures from residents and an international community leery of China's growing authoritarian grip over Hong Kong.
  On Monday, those pressures appeared to boil over as Mrs. Lam announced that she would not seek a second five-year term, marking the end of one of the most tumultuous periods of governance in Hong Kong's recent history.
  Mrs. Lam cited her family as the reason for her plans, saying that they were her priority and that ''they think it is time for me to go back home.'' But for some of her critics, it was Mrs. Lam's failure to guide the city through a devastating coronavirus outbreak that was her final undoing.
  In recent weeks, Mrs. Lam, 64, has faced rebuke from Hong Kong residents, pro-Beijing lawmakers and the city's powerful business community for mishandling an Omicron outbreak that has ravaged hospitals, nursing homes and public services. The surge laid bare the city's lack of preparedness as it struggled to deal with more than a million cases and over 8,000 deaths in just the past couple of months alone.
  But even before the pandemic, there was mounting criticism of Mrs. Lam.
  Once known in the Hong Kong Civil Service, where she began her career 42 years ago, as a ''good fighter'' who never backed down, Mrs. Lam has struggled as chief executive to navigate Hong Kong's unique relationship with Beijing.
  Hong Kong, a former British colony, was promised partial autonomy when it was returned to China in 1997. But its democratic traditions have often been at odds with Beijing. Mrs. Lam has mostly erred on the side of seeking approval from Chinese officials, who have been accused of redefining the ''one country, two systems'' framework that was agreed upon as part of the handover.
  The system was meant to allow Hong Kong to maintain some freedoms distinct from the mainland.
  ''She has been one of the key actors who have buried 'one country, two systems' as we understood it in the first 25 years of the handover,'' said Jean-Pierre Cabestan, a political scientist at Hong Kong Baptist University.
  To many in Hong Kong, it appears that Mrs. Lam has done little to respond to the growing frustrations among residents during the pandemic, failing to change rigid coronavirus policies after a fast-moving outbreak tore through the city's world-class hospital system and further isolated Hong Kong from other countries.
  Two years into the pandemic, many of those policies have contributed to widespread unemployment and the shuttering of thousands of small businesses.
  ''It seems that the government is very removed from the lives of everyday people, and can't seem to gauge how the policies they introduce would make our lives difficult,'' Carmen Chan, a 45-year-old office worker in the Wan Chai commercial district, said Monday.
  Ms. Chan said she had been disappointed by Mrs. Lam's administration and was somewhat relieved to hear that she would not seek another term.
  Mrs. Lam became chief executive in July 2017 after pledging her loyalty to Beijing and promising to foster a stronger sense of Chinese identity among young Hong Kong residents. But deepening polarization of Hong Kong society two years later left her the target of huge street protests in 2019. Demonstrators demanded her resignation over an extradition bill that would allow the city to detain and transfer people to mainland China.
  The bill was met with strong opposition and demonstrations that lasted months.
  In the wake of the protests, Beijing imposed a sweeping new national security law over Hong Kong. It also drastically revamped election rules, giving pro-Beijing lawmakers even greater power to choose the city's top leader and members of its legislature.
  Foreign politicians were openly critical of the new law. The United States imposed sanctions on Mrs. Lam and other senior officials, and Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state at the time, pledged that the United States would ''treat Hong Kong as 'one country, one system.'''
  Mrs. Lam referred to the protests, as well as the coronavirus and ''nonstop interference of foreign forces,'' as contributing to her decision to step down on Monday.
  ''I have faced unprecedented and enormous pressure,'' she said.
  As Mrs. Lam rose through the Hong Kong Civil Service, first under British rule and later under Beijing, she became known for defending policy stances and refusing to back down from arguments. But over the past few months, as Hong Kong tried to hew to China's ''zero Covid'' policy, she was criticized as sending mixed signals regarding how the city would manage the outbreak.
  Hong Kong has some of the strictest travel restrictions in the world. Uncertainty over when those restrictions would end led to the largest exodus of residents since the beginning of the pandemic. While facing increased criticism from the city's business sector and expatriate community, Mrs. Lam doubled down on social distancing measures and an effort to make the city's 7.4 million people test for the virus, something that mainland epidemiologists had advised the city's government to do.
  Mrs. Lam later backed away from mass testing. In late March, she said the city would lift a flight ban on nine countries and begin to relax restrictions, citing concerns that the financial sector was ''losing patience'' after officials indicated that the worst of the latest outbreak was most likely over.
  ''The problem with the chief executive in Hong Kong is that you've got the left hand and the right hand,'' said Allan Zeman, an adviser to Mrs. Lam and a member of the election committee that will decide the city's next chief executive. ''You've got the international community on the one side, and China on the other hand, and you're in the middle. Both have different aspirations.''
  Hong Kong has reported nearly 1.2 million Covid-19 cases and 8,262 deaths, most of them tied to the recent outbreak, and many of them among Hong Kong's older and unvaccinated population. The city's fatality rate from the virus was at one point among the highest in the world, at three per 100,000 residents, in large part because so many older people were not vaccinated, seen as an example of Mrs. Lam's failure to prepare for the outbreak.
  ''Her authority and ability to govern have been severely eroded,'' said Lau Siu-kai, a Hong Kong scholar who advises Beijing on policy, referring to her handling of the protests and pandemic. ''Her departure will allow Beijing to form a new and more powerful team to attain a stronger and more effective government.''
  Addressing speculation on Monday that Hong Kong's No. 2 official, John Lee, would be a favorite to replace her, Mrs. Lam said that she had yet to receive a resignation from any government officials, a precursor to making a bid for the job.
  She also said that she would focus on pandemic-related work until the end of her term on June 30. On Saturday, government officials issued a statement exempting candidates for chief executive from some social distancing rules while campaigning.
  Hong Kong's chief executive is determined every five years in a vote closely managed by Beijing and determined by an election committee made up of nearly 1,500 officials who back the Communist Party. The election was to take place on March 27, but was postponed until May 8 amid Hong Kong's Omicron surge.
  With Mrs. Lam's announcement on Monday, questions about her desire for a second term were put to rest. But little else was certain beyond that. ''Plans keep changing. Everything is unstable. I don't know who will be next. I hope it will get better,'' said Ms. Chan. ''But I don't really expect it to.''

2022/4/5,Hong Kong 's Leader Will Not Seek New Term,Section A; Column 0; Foreign Desk; Pg. 4,"Release your inner explorer. Here's a way to relive, commemorate or envision a favorite place in the world by creating an illustrated map.
Travel and travel planning are being disrupted by the worldwide spread of the coronavirus. For the latest updates, read The New York Times's Covid-19 coverage here. 
  Many of us are in the same situation: homebound, a little restless and a lot distracted. Not only are our future travel plans on hold, but even our local outings and excursions -- a quick trip to the market, a stroll in the park, a walk with the dog -- are limited. That doesn't mean we need to curtail our wanderlust or stop exploring the world around us, and within us. Here is an idea that will help fill the void left by travel restrictions and social distancing, redirect our attention to the immediate worlds we know best -- either before our eyes or in our minds -- while keeping our creative juices flowing:
  Make an illustrated map!
  The rigid and scientific rules of cartography simply do not apply here! Nope. While an illustrated map is often a wildly useless tool for providing directions, it can be a beautiful and highly personal reflection of a place you, friends and family know quite well. It can tell a story, a personal history, or be a unique lens through which one can experience a special place. An illustrated map can be loose and hand-drawn, filled with fun drawings and doodles that together make a sometimes inaccurate, but always spot on record of a memory or a place from one's own perspective.
  As a freelance illustrator who specializes in map illustration, I find that my clients -- hotels, travel magazines, colleges -- ask for an illustrated map because they want to excite their visitors, encourage them to learn more about or visit a specific place. You can use a comparable tactic to create your own illustrated map. Which place do you enjoy the most or know the best? Maybe it's a favorite vacation spot or even your immediate neighborhood. Using illustration to recreate and interpret a place rewards your creativity and shifts your imagination into a dreamy space of idealistic representation and positive recollection.
  Follow these eight steps to make your own illustrated map:
  1) Pick your destination
  Will you illustrate a place you know and love? Maybe your last vacation? Your own neighborhood?
  Or will you illustrate a place you've never been? Maybe the first place you plan to visit once travel is safe again? Or the No. 1 city on your bucket list? Or even a fictional place, like the city in your favorite book, film, or series?!
  2) Make your list of go-to sites
  What sites are there to see? What activities and experiences are there to have? What landmarks or natural wonders exist at your destination? Pick eight to 10 specific sites in and around your destination.
  Consider a fun theme, like all the historical landmarks or public parks or favorite trees or interesting buildings -- the possibilities are endless! You could even build a narrative into your map, so that it tells the story of an adventure or illustrates a specific itinerary or captures the memories of your time at this place. For example, create a memory map of your childhood world!
  3) Plot your sites
  Before I start illustrating a map I use an online mapping tool, such as Google Maps, to plot all the sites. This helps me understand where they all are in relation to each other. This is totally optional -- doing it from memory sometimes produces hilarious results!
  Using a large sheet of paper, start with the most important site on your list. Maybe this is your home or a hotel you've stayed in, or a famous landmark. Lightly sketch a little numbered marker for this site in the center of the space (you'll erase that marker later.) Next, place similar markers all around your central site.
  It's OK to distort your map by reducing the distances between places -- throw accuracy out the window!
  4) Sketch icons for each place
  An icon is a little spot illustration that represents a site. It does not need to be a drawing of the actual building -- it could be anything! A bagel, a taco, a movie camera, a dog walker, an elephant, a rainbow, whatever is super fun and reminds you that specific site. Start with your central site: Erase the little marker and draw an icon in its place.
  5) Place your title
  Find the biggest empty space left on your sketch and use it for the title of your map.
  6) Add roads
  It's important to include at least a few major roads. These give viewers good points of reference.
  7) Include other map elements
  If you have more room, consider placing a compass, an inset map and a legend, too!
  8) Fill it in with fun details
  This is my favorite part! In the empty spaces on your map, illustrate trees, birds, animals, flowers, clouds, rainbows, cars, swirlies, dots, doodles, whatever you want!
