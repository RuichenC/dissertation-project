2022-11-15,Covid-19 reduces appetite for Oatly,FEATURES; Pg. 35,"The New York stock market's taste for Oatly subsided still further yesterday after the oat milk producer backed by celebrity investors including Oprah Winfrey and Jay-Z fell short of quarterly expectations and downgraded its sales guidance for the year.
Shares in the Sweden-based company dropped by 12.6 per cent, or 31 cents, to $2.14 after its latest update compounded unease on Wall Street. Its stock has declined by 74 per cent this year.
While emphasising its travails were ""transitory"", Oatly conceded that they were hampering its ability to expand. Revenue at the group rose by 7 per cent to $183 million in the three months to September 30, shy of the $212 million projected by analysts, according to
Refinitiv. Pre-tax losses almost tripled from $40.6 million to $111.9 million.
Toni Petersson, its chief executive, said: ""Third-quarter financial results were below our expectations, largely driven by Covid-19 restrictions in Asia, production challenges in the Americas and continued foreign exchange headwinds. However, we continue to see year-over-year sales volume growth and minimal price elasticity globally.""
Founded in 1994, Oatly turns fibrerich oats into an alternative to milk, yoghurt and ice cream. The group has a market value of $1.2 billion and is based in Malmo, Sweden.
Petersson, 54, promised ""more profitable growth"" after Oatly moved to cut costs and develop its supply chain, but a significant cut in its annual revenue forecast alarmed Wall Street. The group now expects sales of between $700 million and $720 million this year, growth of between 9 per cent and 12 per cent on 2021 but well short of previous forecasts of between $800 million and $830 million. The latest projection ""assumes reasonable containment"" of Covid-19 worldwide, Oatly said, with no big lockdowns in Asia for the rest of the year.","FINANCIAL RESULTS (90%); NONDAIRY MILK (90%); STOCK EXCHANGES (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (89%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (89%); BUSINESS FORECASTS (78%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS REGULATION & POLICY (78%); LOWERED SALES PROJECTIONS (78%); SALES FIGURES (78%); COMPANY EARNINGS (77%); COMPANY LOSSES (77%); COMPANY PROFITS (77%); FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE & REPORTS (77%); EXECUTIVES (53%)

2022-11-15,Covid-19 reduces appetite for Oatly,FEATURES; Pg. 31,"One in eight people who were admitted to hospital with Covid-19 later suffered heart inflammation, according to research into the clinical long-term effects.
The largest study of its kind to date, led by the University of Glasgow in collaboration with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC), followed 159 patients for a year.
During a period of 450 days after discharge, one in seven patients died or were readmitted to hospital, and two in three patients required NHS outpatient care.
Patients who went to hospital were found to have suffered long-term health problems including inflammation across the body and damage to the other organs such as the kidneys.
Professor Colin Berry, lead investigator of the Cisco study and professor of cardiology and imaging at the University of Glasgow, described Covid-19 as a ""multi-system disease"" and said the study showed that it caused ""injury on the heart, lungs and kidneys"".
""These results bridge a vital knowledge gap between our current understanding of post Covid-19 syndromes, such as long Covid, and objective evidence of ongoing disease,"" he said.
""One of the most important findings of the Cisco study is that it is the severity of a patient's Covid-19 infection, not their underlying health conditions, that is most closely correlated with the severity of any ongoing health outcomes post discharge.
""We found that previously healthy patients, without any underlying health conditions, were suffering with severe health outcomes, including myocarditis, post hospitalisation.
""The reasons for this are unclear, but it may be that a healthy person who is hospitalised with Covid-19 is likely to have a worse Covid infection than someone with underlying health conditions who is hospitalised. More work needs to be done here to understand the risks, and also on how we can better support patients who have ongoing health outcomes after being hospitalised with Covid-19.""
Long Covid has been found to predominantly affect women. The study found that being female was associated with myocarditis, which in turn was linked with lower mental and physical wellbeing.
Researchers believe these findings provide some answers that could explain the physical limitations experienced by some women after being in hospital with Covid-19.
Professor Julie Brittenden, director of research and innovation at NHSGGC, said: ""[We are] pleased to have played an important role in this study. I would like to thank all of our patients who have taken part, as well as the wider research teams.""
Professor David Crossman, chief scientist (health) for Scotland at the time the study was funded, said: ""This study provides important insight into the longer-term effects of Covid-19 infection, and will help inform approaches to treatment going forward.""
The research focused on patients admitted to hospital with Covid-19; however, other studies looking at community Covid infections - those not severe enough to result in hospitalisation - have reported more encouraging data on long-term health recovery. Patients in this study enrolled during the first and second waves of the pandemic, until March 2021, and as a result they were mainly unvaccinated.
Among the patients enrolled in the study, risk factors for heart disease were common, including being overweight or obese, or having high blood pressure, pre-diabetes or diabetes.
The study, a multisystem, cardio-renal investigation of post-Covid illness, is published in Nature Medicine.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); CARDIOLOGY (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INFLAMMATORY DISEASES (90%); INVESTIGATIONS (90%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (90%); RESEARCH REPORTS (90%); CARDIOVASCULAR DISEASE (89%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (89%); HEART DISEASE (89%); LEVELS OF CARE (78%); RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT (78%); WOUNDS & INJURIES (78%); CHRONIC DISEASES (73%); MENTAL HEALTH (60%)

2020-09-30,Screening strategy for Covid-19,NEWS; Pg. 20,"Hundreds of thousands of the most at-risk patients are set to receive an antiviral pill to treat Covid this winter after Britain became the first country to approve the treatment.
The oral drug molnupiravir has been shown to cut the chances of needing admission to hospital in the most vulnerable patients by half, as long as it is given soon after symptoms appear.
Britain has bought 480,000 courses of the treatment, which can be taken at home, in a deal that was announced after it had passed its final stage of trials.
Now that it has been approved by the MHRA, the medical regulator, it is expected to be given to those at risk of severe Covid when they test positive. First deliveries are anticipated this month, with all the ordered doses expected to arrive over the winter.
Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said that the drug could reduce deaths from the disease. ""Today is a historic day for our country, as the UK is now the first country in the world to approve an antiviral that can be taken at home for Covid-19,"" he said. ""This will be a gamechanger for the most vulnerable and the immunosuppressed, who will soon be able to receive the groundbreaking treatment.""
The NHS has yet to explain how the drug will be distributed, with public health experts predicting that the logistics of its delivery will be one of the most crucial elements in ensuring its success.
It is expected that the elderly, the immunocompromised and those with known comorbidities will have priority. If given to everyone who tested positive, Britain's stock would last less than a fortnight. Instead, the patient groups who will benefit the most need to be identified and treated rapidly. Initial deployment will take place as part of a large trial, to find the most effective way of using the drug ? which was not tested in a vaccinated population. Depending on the findings, more doses could be ordered.
""We are working at pace across the government and with the NHS to set   Antiviral pill for Covid-19 out plans to deploy molnupiravir to patients through a national study as soon as possible,"" Javid said.
""This antiviral will be an excellent addition to our armoury against Covid-19, and it remains vital everyone comes forward for their life-saving Covid-19 vaccine ? particularly those eligible for a booster ? to ensure as many people as possible are protected over the coming months.""
June Raine, chief executive of the MHRA, said the fact that the drug could be taken as a pill was a big part of its attraction. ""It means it can be administered outside of a hospital setting, before Covid-19 has progressed to a severe stage,"" she said.
It has not been revealed how much Britain has paid for the drug, which is designed to interfere with the coronavirus life cycle. The US, which has bought 1.7 million courses before approval, is understood to have paid £500 per course.
The drug is made by Merck, known as MSD in Britain, and Ridgeback Biotherapeutics. Wendy Holman, chief executive of Ridgeback, said that speed was of the essence in making it.

An elderly tour group that travelled across China to see the Terracotta Army in Xian are suspected of being behind the country's latest outbreak of coronavirus. China reported 25 cases including nine new domestically transmitted infections on October 18, the highest daily tally since the end of September. Five of the nine new local cases were found in the northwestern city of Xian, and two were in the northern Chinese region of Inner Mongolia, official data showed. A group of seven retirees, who set off from Shanghai in early October for a tour of the northwest, went into isolation after they were all infected. netherlands
New infections jumped 44 per cent in the week to Tuesday, forcing several hospitals to cut back on regular care to deal with a rising number of cases. Infections reached their highest level since the end of July, at 25,751, official data showed, rising for the third consecutive week following the easing of many social distancing measures last month. There were 48 deaths from Covid-19, twice as many as in the previous week.

2021-10-20,Terracotta tour group causes Covid-19 cracks,NEWS; Pg. 15,"Deaths from coronavirus are rising again and there are fears that protection from the vaccine is already waning among vulnerable groups.
There were 39 deaths reported today, taking the death toll over the past week to 146, up from 134 the previous week.
Admissions to intensive care rose for the third day in a row while numbers in Covid wards are declining slowly, with fewer than 1,000 receiving treatment.
The Scottish government has begun administering booster shots to vulnerable and elderly residents who received their first doses at the start of the rollout early this year.
Public Health Scotland said that those who had the Oxford-AstraZeneca jab, the main vaccine given to those over 40, may now have more than a 50-50 chance of catching coronavirus.
""Public Health England analyses show vaccine effectiveness against symptomatic disease with the Delta variant to be approximately 65-70 per cent with AstraZeneca and 80-95 per cent with the Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna vaccines,"" Public Health Scotland, a government body, said.
""In the weeks following vaccination, a recent Scottish study has observed that effectiveness is waning against infection for all vaccine types, between 45-50 per cent effectiveness with Astra- Zeneca and 68-71 per cent effectiveness with Pfizer-BioNTech, but remains high against hospitalisation and death."" Public Health Scotland stressed that the vaccine remained ""highly effective"" but said no vaccine prevented 100 per cent of infections.
It added: ""Covid-19 vaccines are estimated to significantly reduce the risk of mortality for Covid-19, however a small number of Covid-19 deaths are still expected in vaccinated people, especially in vulnerable individuals where the vaccine or the immune response may not have been effective.""
Humza Yousaf, the health secretary, has said that the NHS faces an ""incredibly, incredibly difficult winter"" despite his announcement on Tuesday of a £300 million package for health and social care, which was described as the largest in the history of devolution.
He said that as well as the coronavirus pandemic, low immunity levels to flu could lead to a severe impact.
Alex Rowley, the Scottish Labour MSP, raised concerns at Holyrood's Covid recovery committee yesterday from trade unions that the money still did not go far enough and said staff were under ""immense pressure"".
""There are times when they say [that] in their wards the hospitals are not safe,"" Rowley said. ""That the nurse-patient ratio is way beyond what is acceptable.""
Yousaf said that recruitment would continue, but added: ""These measures will help to mitigate some of the challenges, but we're still in for an incredibly, incredibly difficult winter.
""Clinicians tell me that their real concern is not just the Covid pressures - but we hope to make a significant dent into those as we're controlling transmission - but the flu and other respiratory viruses because our immunity we suspect is quite low.""","VACCINES (93%); DEATH & DYING (92%); PUBLIC HEALTH (91%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); DEATH RATES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (90%); VIRUSES (90%); VULNERABLE ADULTS (90%); VULNERABLE HEALTH POPULATIONS (90%); PANDEMICS (79%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); INFLUENZA (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); INTENSIVE CARE UNITS (77%); LEVELS OF CARE (77%); HEALTH CARE POLICY (75%); UK LABOUR PARTY (74%); NURSES & NURSING (73%); SENIOR CITIZENS (73%); GOVERNMENT ADVISORS & MINISTERS (71%); IMMUNOLOGY (71%); SOCIETY, SOCIAL ASSISTANCE & LIFESTYLE (71%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (70%); LABOR UNIONS (60%)

2021-10-08,Covid-19 deaths rising as vaccine protection fades,NEWS; Pg. 18,"Referees will be instructed this week to remind Premier League captains before matches to observe socialdistancing guidelines as part of a further Covid-19 crackdown.
The Times understands that a series of letters will be sent out by Premier League officials to remind clubs, players and match officials of the need to adhere to strict protocols amid growing concern in government that footballers are committing too many breaches of the regulations. It has led to ministers starting to question whether elite sport can continue.
The Premier League issued a further set of protocols last week after a meeting with Oliver Dowden, the culture secretary, which included instructions for players to avoid shaking hands, hugging or swapping shirts.
However, the third round of the FA Cup brought more controversy at the weekend. Players repeatedly hugged after scoring goals and teams celebrated victories by singing in packed changing rooms, prompting the Premier League to take further action.
Under the new guidance, referees will instruct captains at kick-off to tell their players to observe the protocols whenever possible.
The latest testing figures for Covid-19 did offer the Premier League some encouragement, however, with 36 positives from two rounds of testing for 2,593 players and club staff representing a slight improvement on the previous figure of 40. But, to prevent the season being halted amid the disruption already caused, the Premier League is acutely aware of the need to protect that position.
Fulham were told yesterday with only 48 hours' notice that they would be playing away to Tottenham Hotspur tomorrow. The Premier League has rearranged the match that had been due to be played on December 30 but was postponed after a Covid-19 outbreak at the west London club.
Aston Villa, who were originally due to have played Tottenham tomorrow, have suffered a Covid-19 outbreak of their own that has forced them to close their training ground. To minimise fixture congestion, the Premier League told Fulham that their game with Spurs should take place instead.
It is understood that Fulham were first approached about the reshuffle before their FA Cup victory over Queens Park Rangers on Saturday. Despite the short notice, a senior figure at Fulham told The Times that given the daily death toll from the virus, the club have little objection to the move. Topflight rules also state that fixtures can be rearranged unilaterally by the Premier League.
Scott Parker, the Fulham head coach, and his players, however, are understood to be more aggrieved at the limited time to prepare. As a result of the change, Fulham's fixture at home to Chelsea has been moved from this Friday to Saturday, cutting their recovery time before facing Manchester United next Wednesday. Aston Villa's match with Everton has also been moved, to Sunday lunchtime.
Parker has had limited time to work with his players since the club's training ground reopened last Friday after the outbreak when at least six players and four members of staff tested positive for the virus. Fulham are three points from safety with two matches in hand having also had their fixture against Burnley postponed.
Some Premier League managers have expressed concern over whether the season should continue amid rising Covid-19 cases. However, Nuno Espírito Santo, the Wolverhampton Wanderers head coach, fears that another shutdown could cause smaller clubs to fold.
He said: ""If you have a crisis, the strong will survive, what about the rest? If we stop, everything will change. A new football will come, probably with a Super League, probably with other competitions. This is my biggest fear. The schedule will go crazy and it'll be impossible to finish the league and think about the Euros.""","COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); PROFESSIONAL SPORTS (90%); REFEREES & UMPIRES (90%); SOCCER (90%); SOCIAL DISTANCING (90%); SPORTS & RECREATION (90%); SPORTS OFFICIATING (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (89%); SOCCER TOURNAMENTS (89%); COACHES & TRAINERS (79%); CULTURE DEPARTMENTS (79%); DELAYS & POSTPONEMENTS (78%); TALKS & MEETINGS (77%); ATHLETES (74%)

2021-01-12,Referees part of Covid-19 clampdown,SPORT; Pg. 59,"The lifting of Covid-19 lockdown restrictions remains challenging for some and welcomed by others in the UK. For many British Muslims this time of rebuilding remains bewildering. Families are still raw from the aftermath of a pandemic that has claimed a disproportionately higher number of lives within ethnic minorities, including Muslim communities. In the poorest 10 per cent of areas in England, Covid-19 death rates were double those in wealthier areas.
Multi-generational households, prized and protected as an Islamic family model, were under particular threat. Living arrangements were changed to protect the elderly and vulnerable. Initial scepticism about the government's motivations and policies was tempered by information from mainstream and grassroots initiatives. The stark reality that a deadly disease was rampant in society, regardless of where it came from, how it got here and who benefits from a fear-driven, freedom-curbed society, cut through in the end.
Myriad conversations about practicalities extended to the sign-up for vaccinations: who should have them, which vaccine is safest and what happens if things go wrong. Covid-19 vaccinations became synonymous with distrust and fear.
Hesitancy increased as rumours of vaccines containing pork and the stem cells of aborted foetuses, therefore rendering them haram (forbidden for
Muslims to consume), caused a big upset within Muslim communities.
Many Muslim institutions cited Islamic guidance including Hadiths (written examples of sayings and deeds attributed to Prophet Muhammad) to reassure and support the government's pandemic management. The most commonly cited ones were the Prophet's healthrelated edicts, including directions on virus responses. A lesser known one, ""There are two blessings which many people do not appreciate: health and leisure"", was also cited to reinforce Islamic principles to protect the sanctity of life.
The Al-Abbas Islamic Centre, Balsall Heath, Birmingham, was the UK's first mosque to become a vaccination hub, vaccinating thousands and encouraging other religious institutions to hold similar pop-up clinics.
This targeted approach would have been unthinkable at the start of the pandemic and demonstrated the seriousness of Muslim communities' determination to play their part.
Acts of social kindness strengthened Islamic messaging to emulate the Sunnah, Prophet Muhammad's actions as depicted in the Hadiths. There was a renewed outpouring of people rallying around families impacted by Covid, distributing food parcels and supporting children housed in family bubbles.
For a considerable number of Muslims, this has been a time of reckoning. There is a cross-cultural saying among religious people, ""When one is closer to death, one is closer to God."" Conversations about burials, wills and dignity in death became commonplace after the unexpectedly high death rate.
Muslims have strict rules about death. Rituals include washing the body, wrapping it in a white cloth, and burial never cremation. The shortage of graveyard plots amplified fears that continue to lurk in the background.
For others, introspection remains the guiding thread. My parents were admitted to hospital with Covid-19. I asked my father for his reflections on his faith and how this virus has shaped it.
""It makes you wonder, whatever science may achieve, there are some limits to our progress,"" he said. ""We should also try to be a little more, perhaps, religious and help each other. For without being a better human being, I don't think I qualify to be called a better Muslim.""
My parents' brush with death has changed my approach to life and death. Covid-19 brought home the fact that the surest guarantee in life is death. However, Islamic values are rooted in robust familial, social and cultural bonds. The ties of community kinship, eating, praying and living together are reinforced within Muslim families and communities as guiding Islamic principles.
With the spectre of Covid-19 deaths in the background, Islam preaches that life is a blessing to be lived and celebrated. Key milestones of birth, marriage and death are shared between the Abrahamic brethren. As the dust settles, weddings and other celebrations are bearing witness to things getting back to normal.
British Muslims, along with humans globally, depend on being part of well-knitted communities. We are all dependent on each other and a universal virus needs a universal response. Amina Lone is a director of the Social Action and Research Foundation

2021-08-14,British Muslims have learnt vital lessons from Covid-19,NEWS; Pg. 82,"Bukayo Saka has withdrawn from Gareth Southgate's England squad after testing positive for Covid-19.
The Arsenal winger has left camp and will therefore miss the friendly matches at Wembley Stadium against Switzerland tomorrow and Ivory Coast on Tuesday.
The 20-year-old, who had been in isolation at St George's Park since Wednesday, is the fifth player to pull out of Southgate's original squad - joining his Arsenal team-mate Aaron Ramsdale, Liverpool's Trent Alexander-Arnold, Chelsea's Reece James and Tammy Abraham, of Roma.
Ramsdale was replaced by Sam Johnstone, who then withdrew, meaning the Southampton goalkeeper Fraser Forster, 34, was called up.
Arsenal's Emile Smith Rowe, 21, will be keen to impress, having made his England debut on November 12. He scored his first England goal three days later, in the 10-0 win against San Marino.
Kyle Walker-Peters may have been a late call-up but the prospect of making his senior England debut will not leave the 24-year-old right back daunted.
Walker-Peters moved to Southampton in August 2020 to sample regular Premier League football rather than remain on the periphery at Tottenham Hotspur.
""I definitely didn't doubt myself,"" he said. ""At the time, I needed to go somewhere else, because the opportunities weren't going to come. I'd been at Tottenham since I was ten but I wanted to be a Premier League footballer, and to do that you have to play regular [firstteam] games.""
Walker-Peters had been planning to spend the international break in Milan until Ralph Hasenhüttl, the Southampton manager, informed him that injuries to Alexander-Arnold and James had created an unexpected opportunity. At club level he has been playing at left back, but at St George's Park he has been deployed on the right.
""I'm really enjoying my football at Southampton,"" Walker-Peters said. ""Now I have done well enough to earn a call-up, so I made the right decision.""

2022-03-25,Saka to miss friendly due to Covid-19,SPORT; Pg. 71,"Even as it prepares to reopen its cinemas in the next few weeks, Cineworld has warned that there are significant doubts about its prospects for survival.
The world's second largest cinema chain operator said yesterday that there were ""material uncertainties"" about its ""ability to continue to operate as a going concern"", among them the threat that government restrictions will be reimposed if there is a resurgence of Covid-19.
It made the comments in its annual results, which showed a pre-tax loss of $3 billion last year compared with a pretax profit of $212 million for 2019, with revenue down to $852 million from $4.4 billion. Cinema admissions slumped by 80 per cent to 54.4 million from 275 million.
The figures and forecast were greeted with dismay by investors, who sent shares in Cineworld tumbling by 7.6 per cent, or 7¾p, to 95p. The FTSE 250 group, which is valued at £1.3 billion, has 9,300 screens at 767 theatres in ten countries. Its largest market is the United States, which accounts for about three quarters of its sales. The UK and Ireland make up about 15 per cent of revenue.
Cineworld's cinemas were closed in the middle of March last year and again in October as the second coronavirus wave struck. The company was forced to raise $811 million, negotiate with landlords for rent reductions and deferrals and to tap government support grants and tax rebates, among other things.
Cineworld said that it expected some of its American cinemas to reopen on April 2 and some of those in Britain to reopen on May 17. Mooky Greidinger, its chief executive, said: ""We are well positioned to recover and reopen our cinemas when restrictions are eased and a pipeline of incredible content is in place. The rollout of the vaccine across our territories is clearly critical.
""The outlook is more positive. The performance of the theatrical industry in countries which have broadly recovered from Covid-19 has been encouraging, in particular in China and Japan, where the industry has seen boxoffice records. We believe that we can return to previous performance levels should the situation normalise.""
Cineworld's base-case scenario is that its theatres will reopen worldwide in May at 60 per cent of 2019 capacity, rising to 90 per cent by the end of the year, and that there will be no further government restrictions. Admissions in 2022 would be 10 per cent below 2019 capacity and 5 per cent below in 2023. The company would have sufficient cash reserves to continue operations.
However, it said that there was no certainty about the future of Covid-19, with the potential for further restrictions that would close cinemas. There were ""material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt"" upon the company's ability to operate as a going concern, it said. Among them were the threat of a slower recovery from the pandemic and the timing of an expected $200 million tax refund in the US.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (89%); THEATER (89%); COMPANY LOSSES (79%); NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS (79%); ANNUAL FINANCIAL RESULTS (75%); COMPANY PROFITS (75%); INDUSTRY SECTOR PERFORMANCE (75%); TICKET SALES (74%); VACCINES (73%); TAXES & TAXATION (71%); STOCK INDEXES (68%); CORONAVIRUSES (65%); VIRUSES (65%); EXECUTIVES (50%)

2021-03-26,Cineworld warns Covid-19 could threaten its survival,BUSINESS; Pg. 44,"An under-19 friendly between England and Scotland was abandoned after Billy Stark, the Scotland head coach, received news of a positive coronavirus test during the match.
Negative tests had been returned by players and staff from both teams ahead of the game at the Football Association's St George's Park training complex near Burton upon Trent but, with the sides scheduled to meet again on Sunday, a second round of testing was required and it returned a positive case for Stark, prompting the fixture to be halted.
A statement from the Scottish Football Association read: ""Despite testing negative during Sunday's test, the head coach, Billy Stark, returned a positive test for Covid-19 this afternoon. The result of the second test was immediately relayed to the under-19 team manager and the game was abandoned immediately, in line with established Covid-19 protocol.
""We apologise to the FA for any inconvenience caused and reiterate our commitment to the health and safety of all our international players and staff.""
Stark will travel home in isolation and self-isolate for ten days, while Scotland's players and the rest of the backroom team will undertake precautionary self-isolation for 14 days. Sunday's match between the sides has been postponed, in addition to an under-17 fixture scheduled to be held at St George's Park tomorrow.
Scotland's youngsters had been losing the game 3-1 at the time. The Hibernian full back Josh Doig, Kai Kennedy, the Rangers striker who is on loan at Inverness Caledonian Thistle, and the Hamilton Academical defender Jamie Hamilton were among those who started the match.
It was the under-19s' first game since beating the Czech Republic 1-0 in a friendly in February and the head to head fixtures against England have been arranged to provide muchneeded minutes ahead of next month's Euro 2020 elite qualifying round against hosts France, Russia and Georgia.

The 21-year-old Canadian driver had been feeling unwell and, despite showing symptoms of Covid-19, was in the Nürburgring paddock days before the race on October 11.
He had been tested during the week and returned a negative result. However, on the Saturday it was decided he was too unwell to race and Nico Hülkenberg was drafted in to replace him. Otmar Szafnauer, Racing Point's team principal, revealed Stroll had ""flulike symptoms"" but said at the Eifel Grand Prix that he was ""confident"" Stroll did not have coronavirus.
Racing Point said in a statement: ""[Stroll] consulted with a doctor who did not believe his symptoms indicated Covid-19 and did not advise a test was necessary. Based on this clinical assessment, at the time there was no requirement to inform the FIA as to the nature of the illness."" A spokesman for the FIA, the sport's governing body, said it would not be taking any action because ""we don't feel that there has been any breach of the [Covid] code"".
Stroll flew home on the day of the race by private jet to Switzerland and had a test there, which came back positive. All Racing Point team members have since returned negative results.
The FIA had required all race personnel to be tested every five days. It is understood that the FIA has now changed its protocol, with all personnel tested upon arrival in the host country.

The figures come as separate ONS analysis found that black people were no more likely to die than white people during the second wave, between Sep- tember and late December. A total of 1,404 deaths involving Covid-19 occurred on January 19, according to data on deaths registered to January 29. Since then, the toll measured by registrations has not been above 1,300.
There were 19 consecutive days last month - from January 7 to 25 - when deaths topped 1,000. In April 2020 there were 23 such consecutive days, peaking on April 8 with 1,457 deaths.
About 8,433 deaths registered in England and Wales in the week ending January 29 mentioned Covid-19 on the death certificate - the second highest weekly total since the pandemic began. This is up slightly from 8,422 deaths in the week to January 22 but suggests that numbers are starting to plateau.
More than half of councils recorded more coronavirus deaths in the second wave than the first. In Hastings, East
Sussex, there were 19 times as many, 119, last month as in April last year.
Other areas of East Sussex were similarly badly hit, including Eastbourne where four times as many deaths were recorded in the second wave compared to the third, and Arun, which had nearly five times as many.
In Norfolk, deaths were eight times higher this year in Norwich and three times higher in Broadland.
A study comparing death rates among different ethnicities in the first and second waves showed that while all minority groups had a higher risk of dying with Covid-19 in the first wave, this was true only of people from Bangladeshi and Pakistani backgrounds in the second.

The Times revealed this month that Matt Hancock, the health secretary, agreed to rush the Lions and Team GB Olympians to the top of the priority list. The Lions squad received a dose of the Pfizer vaccine yesterday at the Lensbury Club in Teddington, southwest London.
The only player absent from the gathering was Finn Russell, the Racing 92 fly half, who would have had to quarantine for seven days on his return to Paris. Russell received his first vaccination in France last week. The eight Ireland players in the Lions squad all received doses from UK stocks of the vaccination.
The majority of the squad are likely to receive their second dose during a pre-tour training camp in Jersey.
The government approved proposals to fast-track the Lions' vaccination programme as the tour had the potential to boost the government's pro-union agenda. It was also seen as a means of guarding against the variant of the virus dominant in South Africa, which is braced for a third wave. The number of Covid-19 deaths rose by 29 per cent last week.
Yesterday's gathering was the first time the head coach, Warren Gatland, had his squad in one place since he finalised his selection on May 6. The purpose was chiefly logistical, with players receiving kit and undertaking commercial commitments.
The Lions mascot was also handed over to the youngest member of the touring squad, as is tradition. It will be the responsibility of Louis Rees-Zammit, the 20-year-old Wales wing, to look after BIL, a fluffy toy lion, at all times during the trip.

The Anglo-Swedish company, disclosing for the first time details of the finances of the vaccine developed with Oxford University, said that it had delivered about 68 million doses of the jab during the first quarter, including about $224 million-worth in Europe and $43 million in emerging markets.
AstraZeneca, which formed a partnership with the university last year to put in place a manufacturing consortium and distribution network, has agreed to sell the vaccine on a nonprofit basis during the pandemic. The company could profit in future if it sells the vaccine on a commercial basis in developed countries.
The vaccine, one of the first in the world to be approved by regulators, has the benefit of being cheaper and easier to transport, providing a key response in poorer economies.
Vaccine sales are modest compared with those of Pfizer, the American drugs group, which is working with BioNTech, the German company, and is forecasting $15 billion of sales this year, and Moderna, also of the United States, which is expecting sales of $18.4 billion from its vaccine.
AstraZeneca, one of the world's largest pharmaceuticals companies, is based in Cambridge. The company's fortunes have been transformed under Pascal Soriot, its chief executive since 2012, who has overseen the successful development and commercialisation of new drugs, particularly in oncology, which has boosted its finances.
AstraZeneca has been seeking to continue to expand its main business, while acquiring Alexion, a rare diseases company, for $39 billion and running the manufacturing consortium, distribution and sale of the Oxford vaccine.
Total first-quarter revenue rose by 11 per cent to $7.3 billion, including sales of the vaccine. Costs related to the Covid-19 jab, however, weakened earnings per share by three cents, although the figure was still ahead of City forecasts. Stripping out the vaccine sales, revenue was ahead of the consensus among analysts as AstraZeneca continued to benefit from new drugs.
Soriot said that it meant ""continued profitability and cashflow generation, despite the pandemic's negative impact on the diagnosis and treatment of many conditions"".
AstraZeneca reiterated its full-year forecasts, but said that it expected its performance to improve in the second half of the year as the impact of the pandemic declined.
The positive update came despite a turbulent start to the year as the company contends with a legal battle with the European Union over supply delays. It helped lift the shares by 4.3 per cent, or 317p, to £77.15. They peaked at more than £93 last summer and Astra- Zeneca was briefly the most valuable company in the FTSE 100.
New medicines generated more than half of AstraZeneca's revenue. Oncology sales rose by 16 per cent to $3 billion, led by Tagrisso. Sales of new cardiovascular drugs added 15 per cent to $1.3 billion, offsetting a 4 per cent decline in respiratory and immunology sales to $1.5 billion.

Vaccine sales are modest compared with those of Pfizer, the American drugs group, which is working with BioNTech, the German company, and is forecasting $15 billion of sales this year, and Moderna, also of the United States, which is expecting sales of $18.4 billion from its vaccine.
AstraZeneca, one of the world's largest pharmaceuticals companies, is based in Cambridge. The company's fortunes have been transformed under Pascal Soriot, its chief executive since 2012, who has overseen the successful development and commercialisation of new drugs, particularly in oncology, which has boosted its finances.
AstraZeneca has been seeking to continue to expand its main business, while acquiring Alexion, a rare diseases company, for $39 billion and running the manufacturing consortium, distribution and sale of the Oxford vaccine.
Total first-quarter revenue rose by 11 per cent to $7.3 billion, including sales of the vaccine. Costs related to the Covid-19 jab, however, weakened earnings per share by three cents, although the figure was still ahead of City forecasts. Stripping out the vaccine sales, revenue was ahead of the consensus among analysts as AstraZeneca continued to benefit from new drugs.
Soriot said that it meant ""continued profitability and cashflow generation, despite the pandemic's negative impact on the diagnosis and treatment of many conditions"".
AstraZeneca reiterated its full-year forecasts, but said that it expected its performance to improve in the second half of the year as the impact of the pandemic declined.
The positive update came despite a turbulent start to the year as the company contends with a legal battle with the European Union over supply delays. It helped lift the shares by 4.3 per cent, or 317p, to £77.15. They peaked at more than £93 last summer and Astra- Zeneca was briefly the most valuable company in the FTSE 100.
New medicines generated more than half of AstraZeneca's revenue. Oncology sales rose by 16 per cent to $3 billion, led by Tagrisso. Sales of new cardiovascular drugs added 15 per cent to $1.3 billion, offsetting a 4 per cent decline in respiratory and immunology sales to $1.5 billion.

However, this is not possible without supporting the most vulnerable, including the 320,000 people who use drugs problematically. Many of these people suffer underlying conditions that put them at greater risk. Without support there will be a disproportionate increase in both coronavirus infections and other health problems, creating yet more pressure on the NHS.
We urgently need more funding for treatment. The provision of sterile needles, opioid substitution treatment and the anti-overdose drug naloxone must be increased. Accommodation for the homeless should include provision for those who are not able to stop using drugs immediately. People at risk of arrest should instead be diverted towards services. Those incarcerated for non-violent offences should be considered for early release, not least because the virus is taking hold in prisons.

2020-03-28,Drugs and Covid-19,FEATURES; Pg. 30,"Data published yesterday by the Office for National Statistics showed that gross domestic product in Britain finally in November surpassed its pre-pandemic peak. GDP rose by 0.9 per cent in the month, double the rise forecast by economists. In the aftermath of the deepest recession of any leading economy and highest number of deaths from Covid-19 of any European country, this is welcome news. It is further evidence that the worst of the pandemic is now behind us, and with less longterm economic damage than feared. Although GDP growth is likely to have slowed again over the past two months because of the disruption caused by the Omicron wave, any dip is likely to prove short-lived as restrictions are quickly lifted.
Indeed there was good news yesterday on the wider pandemic front too. The latest data showed that Omicron infections were falling in every region of England. NHS bosses are now confident that the health service will not be overwhelmed by the present wave. The Welsh government, which imposed the toughest restrictions in anticipation of a surge in hospital admissions, announced yesterday that it was ending its ban on indoor socialising and large crowds for sports events. There now seems little need for the government to renew most plan B restrictions in England when they lapse on January 26. That would mean an end to guidance to work from home if possible or to wear a mask in indoor public places.
For the first time since the coronavirus was first identified two years ago and just over a year after the initial euphoria of the start of the vaccine programme, it appears likely that the pandemic, in Britain at least, is over. That does not mean that Covid-19 as a risk to public health has gone away. Although it must be hoped that as the virus continues to mutate, future variants will, like Omicron, prove milder even if more transmissible, the emergence of new deadlier strains cannot be ruled out. Nonetheless, the challenge now must be to learn to live with Covid-19 so that no return to such draconian restrictions is needed again.
The first requirement must be to maintain vigilance, even as the risk levels recede. Continued advances in medical treatment should make it easier to tackle future waves, That includes the imminent arrival of antivirals that can significantly reduce the risk of severe illness and hospitalisation. Habits acquired during the pandemic, such as a more rigorous approach to hygiene, will need to be maintained. But the key to living with Covid-19 will continue to be the vaccine programme. For that reason, the government would be well advised to stick with policies designed to encourage vaccine take-up, including vaccine passports for entry to nightclubs and large public events.
The second requirement must be to learn the lessons of what has gone wrong over the past two years that has left Britain near the bottom of the table among developed countries in terms of economic and health outcomes. What became apparent at the start of the pandemic was that the contingency plans drawn up by previous governments were woefully inadequate. The legacy of that failure is vast backlogs in healthcare, the courts and education that will take years to overcome. The country needs a serious strategy to tackle future outbreaks of this and other deadly viruses.

2020-06-03,Yemen needs help to combat Covid-19,NEWS; Pg. 24,"Sales of a booster for Covid-19 vaccines have helped to lift quarterly sales at GlaxoSmithKline ahead of City forecasts.
For the first time, the drugs group yesterday disclosed sales from its Covid-19 ""solutions"", showing £276 million in the first half of the year, of which £258 million comprised adjuvant sales to partner drugs companies and £16 million from sotrovimab, its investigational monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of coronavirus patients with mild symptoms.
Earlier GSK said that it had signed a contract with the European Union for the supply of sotrovimab, which has emergency use authorisation in the EU and the United States.
The sales helped to offset pressures elsewhere in the group's vaccines business, one of its three divisions, which has been disrupted by the pandemic. Vaccine revenues rose by 49 per cent to almost £1.6 billion in the second quarter. Excluding pandemic sales, they were up 24 per cent at £1.3 billion.
Sales of vaccines, particularly GSK's key Shingrix treatment for shingles, have been disrupted by governments prioritising Covid-19 jabs and measures to contain the pandemic.
Fast coronavirus vaccine programmes, such as those in Britain and America, are helping healthcare systems to return to normal, but GSK said that there was a slower pace of deployment in other big markets. Thus Shingrix sales are expected to recover more slowly outside of the US and vaccines revenue for 2021 is set to be ""broadly flat"".
GlaxoSmithKline is one of the world's biggest vaccines companies. It has been criticised over delays producing a successful Covid-19 vaccine and also over the pace of the turnaround of its pharmaceuticals and broader vaccines pipeline after years of underperformance. It has come under pressure from Elliott Management, an American activist hedge fund, which emerged with a stake in April.
GSK has partnerships with several drugs companies to produce Covid-19 vaccines, including Sanofi, of France, and Medicago, of Canada, where it is providing its adjuvant technology. This is important in a pandemic as it can reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more doses to be produced.
Analysts at Jefferies said that adjuvant sales had helped GSK's sales to surpass City forecasts. The shares rose 2½p, or 0.2 per cent, to £14.01½p.
Group sales rose to £8.1 billion in the three months to June, up 15 per cent on a constant currency basis, while adjusted operating profit rose by 43 per cent to almost £2.2 billion.
On a statutory basis, pre-tax profit fell to £1.5 billion from £2.6 billion in the quarter, reflecting an unfavourable comparison with last year, when it profited from the disposal of Horlicks and other consumer brands.
Dame Emma Walmsley, 52, chief executive of GSK since 2017, whose position has come under scrutiny after Elliott's investment, said that it had been an ""excellent quarter"" and that she expected ""positive momentum to continue through the second half of the year, driving us towards the better end of our earnings guidance range for 2021 and meaningful performance improvement in 2022"".
GSK had forecast adjusted earnings per share, its preferred measure of profitability, this year to decline by a ""midto-high-single-digit"" percentage.
At its eagerly awaited capital markets day last month, GSK vowed that after four years of restructuring it was poised to deliver ""a step-change in growth"" over the next decade. It is targeting sales growth and adjusted operating profit growth of more than 5 per cent and more than 10 per cent, respectively, over the next five years, before hitting sales of more than £33 billion by 2031 in ""New GSK"", the name assigned to its remaining biopharma business of vaccines and pharmaceuticals after next summer's planned separation of its consumer healthcare business.
The separation, via a London listing of the consumer business, is the centrepiece of Walmsley's strategy to give New GSK the firepower and flexibility to invest in producing new drugs.
Behind the story
Since Elliott Management, the feared American hedge fund, emerged with a stake in GlaxoSmithKline in April, trading updates from one of Britain's biggest drugs companies have taken on added significance (Alex Ralph writes).
Although Elliott doesn't have anything publicly tangible to show from its campaign so far, its investment appears to have galvanised GSK's management and given restructuring efforts under Dame Emma Walmsley, the chief executive, increased momentum.
Walmsley, 52, said yesterday that GSK's management had held more than 400 meetings with shareholders in recent months. She said that there had been a ""huge amount of support"" on the company's strategy, including ""broadbased support"" for the separation of its consumer health business from its drugs and vaccines divisions.
GSK confirmed plans at last month's capital markets day to spin-off the consumer business next summer. It also issued long-term forecasts and said that it had a late-stage drugs pipeline with the potential to deliver peak combined annual sales of more than £20 billion.
Yesterday GSK pointed to improvements in its pharmaceuticals division, with revenue rising by 12 per cent to £4.2 billion, boosted partly by sales of new and speciality products, such as Trelegy and Nucala, the respiratory drugs. The comparison was flattered, though, by wholesalers' destocking in the second quarter of last year after busy Covid-19-related buying in the first quarter.
""What shareholders want us to focus on ? and we remain resolutely focussed on ? is execution ? execution and delivery ? and that is exactly the plan and I am pleased to say that this quarter and through this year we are making good progress on that, whether it be commercial execution or pipeline or preparation for separation,"" Walmsley said.","VACCINES (95%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); BIOLOGICS MFG (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE & REPORTS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS (90%); COMPANY REVENUES (89%); FINANCIAL RESULTS (89%); ALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPS (79%); COMPANY PROFITS (79%); SALES & SELLING (79%); SALES FIGURES (79%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); SALES PROJECTIONS (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); VIRUSES (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (76%); MEDICAL TREATMENTS & PROCEDURES (76%); NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS (76%); EUROPEAN UNION (75%); SHINGLES (73%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (68%); EXECUTIVES (62%); HEDGE FUNDS (50%)

Fast coronavirus vaccine programmes, such as those in Britain and America, are helping healthcare systems to return to normal, but GSK said that there was a slower pace of deployment in other big markets. Thus Shingrix sales are expected to recover more slowly outside of the US and vaccines revenue for 2021 is set to be ""broadly flat"".
GlaxoSmithKline is one of the world's biggest vaccines companies. It has been criticised over delays producing a successful Covid-19 vaccine and also over the pace of the turnaround of its pharmaceuticals and broader vaccines pipeline after years of underperformance. It has come under pressure from Elliott Management, an American activist hedge fund, which emerged with a stake in April.
GSK has partnerships with several drugs companies to produce Covid-19 vaccines, including Sanofi, of France, and Medicago, of Canada, where it is providing its adjuvant technology. This is important in a pandemic as it can reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more doses to be produced.
Analysts at Jefferies said that adjuvant sales had helped GSK's sales to surpass City forecasts. The shares rose 2½p, or 0.2 per cent, to £14.01½p.
Group sales rose to £8.1 billion in the three months to June, up 15 per cent on a constant currency basis, while adjusted operating profit rose by 43 per cent to almost £2.2 billion.
On a statutory basis, pre-tax profit fell to £1.5 billion from £2.6 billion in the quarter, reflecting an unfavourable comparison with last year, when it profited from the disposal of Horlicks and other consumer brands.
Dame Emma Walmsley, 52, chief executive of GSK since 2017, whose position has come under scrutiny after Elliott's investment, said that it had been an ""excellent quarter"" and that she expected ""positive momentum to continue through the second half of the year, driving us towards the better end of our earnings guidance range for 2021 and meaningful performance improvement in 2022"".
GSK had forecast adjusted earnings per share, its preferred measure of profitability, this year to decline by a ""midto-high-single-digit"" percentage.
At its eagerly awaited capital markets day last month, GSK vowed that after four years of restructuring it was poised to deliver ""a step-change in growth"" over the next decade. It is targeting sales growth and adjusted operating profit growth of more than 5 per cent and more than 10 per cent, respectively, over the next five years, before hitting sales of more than £33 billion by 2031 in ""New GSK"", the name assigned to its remaining biopharma business of vaccines and pharmaceuticals after next summer's planned separation of its consumer healthcare business.
The separation, via a London listing of the consumer business, is the centrepiece of Walmsley's strategy to give New GSK the firepower and flexibility to invest in producing new drugs.
Behind the story
Since Elliott Management, the feared American hedge fund, emerged with a stake in GlaxoSmithKline in April, trading updates from one of Britain's biggest drugs companies have taken on added significance (Alex Ralph writes).
Although Elliott doesn't have anything publicly tangible to show from its campaign so far, its investment appears to have galvanised GSK's management and given restructuring efforts under Dame Emma Walmsley, the chief executive, increased momentum.
Walmsley, 52, said yesterday that GSK's management had held more than 400 meetings with shareholders in recent months. She said that there had been a ""huge amount of support"" on the company's strategy, including ""broadbased support"" for the separation of its consumer health business from its drugs and vaccines divisions.
GSK confirmed plans at last month's capital markets day to spin-off the consumer business next summer. It also issued long-term forecasts and said that it had a late-stage drugs pipeline with the potential to deliver peak combined annual sales of more than £20 billion.
Yesterday GSK pointed to improvements in its pharmaceuticals division, with revenue rising by 12 per cent to £4.2 billion, boosted partly by sales of new and speciality products, such as Trelegy and Nucala, the respiratory drugs. The comparison was flattered, though, by wholesalers' destocking in the second quarter of last year after busy Covid-19-related buying in the first quarter.
""What shareholders want us to focus on ? and we remain resolutely focussed on ? is execution ? execution and delivery ? and that is exactly the plan and I am pleased to say that this quarter and through this year we are making good progress on that, whether it be commercial execution or pipeline or preparation for separation,"" Walmsley said.","VACCINES (95%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); BIOLOGICS MFG (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE & REPORTS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS (90%); COMPANY REVENUES (89%); FINANCIAL RESULTS (89%); ALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPS (79%); COMPANY PROFITS (79%); SALES & SELLING (79%); SALES FIGURES (79%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); SALES PROJECTIONS (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); VIRUSES (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (76%); MEDICAL TREATMENTS & PROCEDURES (76%); NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS (76%); EUROPEAN UNION (75%); SHINGLES (73%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (68%); EXECUTIVES (62%); HEDGE FUNDS (50%)

For the first time, the drugs group yesterday disclosed sales from its Covid-19 ""solutions"", showing £276 million in the first half of the year, of which £258 million comprised adjuvant sales to partner drugs companies and £16 million from sotrovimab, its investigational monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of coronavirus patients with mild symptoms.
Earlier GSK said that it had signed a contract with the European Union for the supply of sotrovimab, which has emergency use authorisation in the EU and the United States.

Porsche McGregor-Sims, 27, from Portsmouth, had seen a medical professional complaining of abdominal pain and bleeding months earlier but was told her symptoms were ""hormonal"", an inquest was told.
When she felt a shortness of breath two months later in March 2020 as the country entered its first lockdown she had two phone consultations and was prescribed antibiotics.
The hearing at Portsmouth coroner's court was told that McGregor-Sims was only seen face to face by doctors after her continued shortness of breath was falsely believed to be Covid-19.
The events management graduate was rushed to Queen Alexandra Hospital in Portsmouth where an aggressive form of cervical cancer was diagnosed. She died a day later on April 14, 2020.
Dr Peter Schlesinger, an agency locum gynaecologist at the hospital who saw McGregor-Sims when she was first referred by her GP, apologised to the family for not picking up her cancer and said he thought her symptoms were ""hormonal"" after she stopped birth control injections a year earlier.
""The rather specific nature of her bleeding made me think her risk of cervical cancer was small,"" he told the hearing. ""In light of her normal smear test and her age, I didn't think a vaginal examination was needed - there seemed to be no benefit.
""I appreciate the fact I was wrong, but given the myriad of symptoms this young woman had I felt the right approach was hormonal manipulation. The fact is
I was wrong. I apologise.""
Fiona Hawke, McGregor-Sims's mother criticised the doctor for failing to do the most ""basic"" checks by not physically examining her daughter. ""You focused on her IBS [irritable bowel syndrome] and a different type of bleeding ... and that just doesn't make sense to me.""
McGregor-Sims, who was engaged to her long-term partner, whom she had met at university, had her first smear test in 2017. It revealed no cancerous cells but did show some abnormality. Despite this no further action was taken.
Friends and family paid tribute to McGregor-Sims. Her mother said: ""Losing her is like having the sun burnt out."" A crowdfunding campaign in her honour raised almost £4,000 for flowers at her funeral.
The inquest was adjourned to be resumed at a later date.

Public health experts were shocked to find an additional 364 deaths in the first week of April that were not attributed to Covid-19. National Records of Scotland published its second weekly coronavirus bulletin yesterday, which revealed an excess 251 deaths.
There have now been 1,515 more deaths under lockdown than in an average April. Only 962 have been attributed to Covid-19.
Nicola Sturgeon admitted that she faced a ""horrendously difficult challenge"" in weighing the costs of the lockdown in lives and economic hardship with the inevitable deaths from Covid-19 that will result if she lifts the restrictions. The first minister said yesterday that it would be vital to understand the reasons behind then extra deaths as the lockdown continues for the foreseeable future, with no sign of a vaccine emerging soon.
Linda Bauld, a behavioural scientist at Edinburgh University, raised concerns last week that people were dying at home from heart attacks and other treatable conditions because they did not want to bother GPs. Conditions such as diabetes or high blood pressure are also thought to be harder to manage in lockdown.
Professor Bauld also voiced fears that people were drinking themselves to death or committing suicide due to stress of the lockdown and a loss of earnings. Sir Harry Burns, who was chief medical officer for Scotland between 2005-2014, suggested that some of the deaths would be due to organ failure brought on by undiagnosed Covid-19 infections.
Yesterday Ms Sturgeon said the rising death rate from non-Covid 19 illnesses was ""still being explored"" and was a global phenomenon.
Dr Gregor Smith, the interim chief medical officer for Scotland, said: ""I think it is very likely that we will see a variety of contributing factors rather than one single factor that is producing this very clear excess above what we would expect.""
In England and Wales last week there were 6,000 deaths above the five-year average, with 3,475 recorded as related to coronavirus.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (92%); DEATH & DYING (91%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (90%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (89%); DEATH NOTICES & OBITUARIES (88%); DEATH RATES (78%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (78%); NEGATIVE NEWS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH (78%); VIRUSES (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (77%); POPULATION CHARACTERISTICS (73%); VACCINES (73%); HYPERTENSION (71%); EXECUTIVES (70%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (67%); HEART DISEASE (66%); DIABETES (51%); SUICIDE (50%)

A cross-party group, including senior Conservative MPs, is examining whether the government's renewal motion could be hijacked to repeal some of the act's controversial elements.
Passed in March, the act created sweeping new powers to deal with the crisis, including significant changes to policing, the courts, borders, the NHS, care homes, schools and elections. It must be renewed by a Commons vote every six months.

Otmar Szafnauer, Racing Point's team principal, revealed Stroll had ""flulike symptoms"" but said at the Eifel Grand Prix that he was ""confident"" Stroll did not have coronavirus.
Racing Point said in a statement: ""[Stroll] consulted with a doctor who did not believe his symptoms indicated Covid-19 and did not advise a test was necessary. Based on this clinical assessment, at the time there was no requirement to inform the FIA as to the nature of the illness."" A spokesman for the FIA, the sport's governing body, said it would not be taking any action because ""we don't feel that there has been any breach of the [Covid] code"".
Stroll flew home on the day of the race by private jet to Switzerland and had a test there, which came back positive. All Racing Point team members have since returned negative results.

Before long it had killed a good part of the city. The Black Death eventually passed but it left a legacy that still shapes how our bodies fight disease.
The research reveals that the plague, which may have killed more than half the population of Europe in the 14th century, left an imprint on our immune system. Thanks to variants of genes that helped to protect people - and which therefore became far more common among the population - many of us are now more susceptible to diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis and lupus. Those genes may also have worsened the effects of coronavirus and the Spanish flu of 1918.
The researchers examined DNA from the bones of more than 200 people from the East Smithfield plague cemetery and those in Denmark who died at about the time of the plague in the 1340s.
The results suggest that versions of some genes gave some people a far better chance of surviving the Black Death. The most prominent was ERAP2, which activated key parts of the body's defences. However, in modern populations it raises the risk of diseases linked to an overactive immune system, such as Crohn's disease and rheumatoid arthritis.
ERAP2 can also stir up dangerously aggressive immune responses against a virus. These ""cytokine storms"" are thought have been a cause of death during the 1918 flu pandemic and were also seen with Covid.
""A hyperactive immune system may have been great in the past but today it might not be as helpful,"" said Professor Hendrik Poinar, of McMaster University in Canada, a senior author of the study, which was published in the journal Nature. ""What provided tremendous protection during hundreds of years of plague epidemics has turned out to be autoimmunerelated now.""
Caused by the bacterium Yersinia pestis, the plague wiped out 30 to 60 per cent of the populations of cities across north Africa, Europe and Asia. The researchers focused on 300 immune-related genes. Of those, four were found to come in versions that protected against or raised susceptibility to the Black Death.
Those who possessed two copies of one version of ERAP2 produce more of a protein that helps the body recognise an infection. The team estimate that they would have been about 40 per cent more likely to survive the plague than those with two copies of a less protective version. The evidence was supported by laboratory tests.
""This is the first demonstration that the Black Death was an important selective pressure to the evolution of the immune system,"" Professor Luis Barreiro, of Chicago University, also a senior author, said.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); AUTOIMMUNE DISORDERS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); DEATH & DYING (90%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (90%); GENES & CHROMOSOMES (90%); IMMUNE SYSTEM DISORDERS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INFLAMMATORY DISEASES (90%); RHEUMATIC DISEASES (90%); WRITERS (89%); INFLUENZA (88%); DNA (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); BACTERIA (77%); CORONAVIRUSES (77%); IMMUNOLOGY (77%); LUPUS (77%); RESEARCH REPORTS (77%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (77%); VIRUSES (77%); GASTROINTESTINAL DISORDERS (72%); ARTHRITIS (69%); COLLEGE & UNIVERSITY PROFESSORS (68%)

Ministers announced that an additional £100 million will be invested in the new state-of-the-art centre to scale up Covid-19 vaccine and gene therapy manufacturing. The investment will fund a cell and gene therapy catapult manufacturing innovation centre in Braintree, Essex, which is due to open in December 2021.
The government said the centre, bought from Benchmark Holdings for £16 million, will have the capacity to produce millions of doses a month, ensuring the UK has the capabilities to manufacture vaccines and advanced medicines, including for emerging diseases, far into the future.
Alok Sharma, the business secretary, said: ""We are taking all necessary steps to ensure we can vaccinate the public as soon as a successful Covid-19 vaccine becomes available.""
Benchmark struck the deal with the government after Peter George, the chairman of the animal health company, emailed Sir Patrick Vallance, the UK's chief scientific adviser.
The fish vaccine manufacturing facility in Braintree was built under a previous management team but had barely been used and the company was thinking of selling it. Within ten minutes Sir Patrick had replied to Mr George, confirming that the government was indeed on the hunt for more facilities at which it could start making a coronavirus vaccine, as and when scientists find one. ""I was absolutely gobsmacked when I got a response so quickly,"" Mr George said.

Novacyt said yesterday that its revenue had surged to (EURO)72.4 million in the six months to the end of June, compared with (EURO)7.2 million a year earlier, propelling the previously loss-making company to a pre-tax profit of (EURO)46.1 million.
The turnaround is thanks to the early development of its polymerase chain reaction tests and multiple supply deals worldwide, including with the British government and a partnership with Astrazeneca on a testing laboratory at the University of Cambridge.
Novacyt, which is listed in London and Paris, operates almost entirely in the UK, where it has a head office and manufacturing site in Camberley, Surrey. Primerdesign, which it acquired in 2016 for £12.3 million and which is behind its tests, is based near Southampton.
Novacyt said that the orders outlook for its Covid-19 products meant that its performance in the second half of the year was on track to exceed the first half. Full-year revenues are set to surpass (EURO)150 million. It also expects its rate of financial performance to extend into the first half of next year.
Novacyt is pursuing product and company acquisitions to generate addi-tional revenues and profits to ""offset potential future reductions in Covid-19 revenues"", as well as to boost its target of becoming a market leader in respiratory and transplant clinical diagnostics. The bumper results have allowed it to wipe out its (EURO)8.3 million debts.
Graham Mullis, chief executive, said that Novacyt was pursuing specific technology deals, as well as acquisitions of profitable revenue-generating companies in Europe and the United States that would enable it to ""penetrate markets with our products faster"" than through its distribution network.
Mr Mullis, 57, said that Novacyt faced no constraints in supplying tests to the British government, which has been criticised for shortages.
""The situation is very, very complex. It is not just a question of having the right reagent, but the right trained people, the right logistics and the right systems in place.""

2020-09-18,Novacyt plans deals before drop in Covid-19 revenues,NEWS; Pg. 42,"Sales of a booster for Covid-19 vaccines have helped to lift quarterly sales at GlaxoSmithKline ahead of City forecasts.
For the first time, the drugs group yesterday disclosed sales from its Covid-19 ""solutions"", showing £276 million in the first half of the year, of which £258 million comprised adjuvant sales to partner drugs companies and £16 million from sotrovimab, its investigational monoclonal antibody therapy for the treatment of coronavirus patients with mild symptoms.
Earlier GSK said that it had signed a contract with the European Union for the supply of sotrovimab, which has emergency use authorisation in the EU and the United States.
The sales helped to offset pressures elsewhere in the group's vaccines business, one of its three divisions, which has been disrupted by the pandemic. Vaccine revenues rose by 49 per cent to almost £1.6 billion in the second quarter. Excluding pandemic sales, they were up 24 per cent at £1.3 billion.
Sales of vaccines, particularly GSK's key Shingrix treatment for shingles, have been disrupted by governments prioritising Covid-19 jabs and measures to contain the pandemic.
Fast coronavirus vaccine programmes, such as those in Britain and America, are helping healthcare systems to return to normal, but GSK said that there was a slower pace of deployment in other big markets. Thus Shingrix sales are expected to recover more slowly outside of the US and vaccines revenue for 2021 is set to be ""broadly flat"".
GlaxoSmithKline is one of the world's biggest vaccines companies. It has been criticised over delays producing a successful Covid-19 vaccine and also over the pace of the turnaround of its pharmaceuticals and broader vaccines pipeline after years of underperformance. It has come under pressure from Elliott Management, an American activist hedge fund, which emerged with a stake in April.
GSK has partnerships with several drugs companies to produce Covid-19 vaccines, including Sanofi, of France, and Medicago, of Canada, where it is providing its adjuvant technology. This is important in a pandemic as it can reduce the amount of vaccine protein required per dose, allowing more doses to be produced.
Analysts at Jefferies said that adjuvant sales had helped GSK's sales to surpass City forecasts. The shares rose 2½p, or 0.2 per cent, to £14.01½p.
Group sales rose to £8.1 billion in the three months to June, up 15 per cent on a constant currency basis, while adjusted operating profit rose by 43 per cent to almost £2.2 billion.
On a statutory basis, pre-tax profit fell to £1.5 billion from £2.6 billion in the quarter, reflecting an unfavourable comparison with last year, when it profited from the disposal of Horlicks and other consumer brands.
Dame Emma Walmsley, 52, chief executive of GSK since 2017, whose position has come under scrutiny after Elliott's investment, said that it had been an ""excellent quarter"" and that she expected ""positive momentum to continue through the second half of the year, driving us towards the better end of our earnings guidance range for 2021 and meaningful performance improvement in 2022"".
GSK had forecast adjusted earnings per share, its preferred measure of profitability, this year to decline by a ""midto-high-single-digit"" percentage.
At its eagerly awaited capital markets day last month, GSK vowed that after four years of restructuring it was poised to deliver ""a step-change in growth"" over the next decade. It is targeting sales growth and adjusted operating profit growth of more than 5 per cent and more than 10 per cent, respectively, over the next five years, before hitting sales of more than £33 billion by 2031 in ""New GSK"", the name assigned to its remaining biopharma business of vaccines and pharmaceuticals after next summer's planned separation of its consumer healthcare business.
The separation, via a London listing of the consumer business, is the centrepiece of Walmsley's strategy to give New GSK the firepower and flexibility to invest in producing new drugs.
Behind the story
Since Elliott Management, the feared American hedge fund, emerged with a stake in GlaxoSmithKline in April, trading updates from one of Britain's biggest drugs companies have taken on added significance (Alex Ralph writes).
Although Elliott doesn't have anything publicly tangible to show from its campaign so far, its investment appears to have galvanised GSK's management and given restructuring efforts under Dame Emma Walmsley, the chief executive, increased momentum.
Walmsley, 52, said yesterday that GSK's management had held more than 400 meetings with shareholders in recent months. She said that there had been a ""huge amount of support"" on the company's strategy, including ""broadbased support"" for the separation of its consumer health business from its drugs and vaccines divisions.
GSK confirmed plans at last month's capital markets day to spin-off the consumer business next summer. It also issued long-term forecasts and said that it had a late-stage drugs pipeline with the potential to deliver peak combined annual sales of more than £20 billion.
Yesterday GSK pointed to improvements in its pharmaceuticals division, with revenue rising by 12 per cent to £4.2 billion, boosted partly by sales of new and speciality products, such as Trelegy and Nucala, the respiratory drugs. The comparison was flattered, though, by wholesalers' destocking in the second quarter of last year after busy Covid-19-related buying in the first quarter.
""What shareholders want us to focus on ? and we remain resolutely focussed on ? is execution ? execution and delivery ? and that is exactly the plan and I am pleased to say that this quarter and through this year we are making good progress on that, whether it be commercial execution or pipeline or preparation for separation,"" Walmsley said.","VACCINES (95%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (94%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (94%); BIOLOGICS MFG (90%); EPIDEMICS (90%); FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE & REPORTS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); INTERIM FINANCIAL RESULTS (90%); COMPANY REVENUES (89%); FINANCIAL RESULTS (89%); ALLIANCES & PARTNERSHIPS (79%); COMPANY PROFITS (79%); EUROPEAN UNION (79%); SALES & SELLING (79%); SALES FIGURES (79%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); SALES PROJECTIONS (78%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (78%); VIRUSES (78%); CORONAVIRUSES (76%); MEDICAL TREATMENTS & PROCEDURES (76%); NEGATIVE BUSINESS NEWS (76%); SHINGLES (73%); INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC ORGANIZATIONS (68%); EXECUTIVES (62%); HEDGE FUNDS (50%)

2020-12-10,Passenger on cruise ship hailed as safe has Covid-19,NEWS; Pg. 11,"More than 1,000 patients have contracted coronavirus inside Scotland's hospitals in just over three months.
Data published by Public Health Scotland shows 1,036 cases over the period described as being ""definite hospital onset"", where a patient tested positive for Covid-19 fifteen days or more after being admitted to hospital. From the week ending March 1 to the week ending June 7, a further 265 cases were classed as ""probably hospital onset"", with a positive test for virus coming 8-14 days after admission.
For the week ending June 7, which is the most recent period there are figures for, four cases occurred where coronavirus was definitely contracted within hospital, with an additional three probable infections.
Monica Lennon, Labour health spokeswoman, said: ""Experts were warning of the risks of healthcare transmission at the start of the crisis yet action on PPE [personal protective equipment] and testing was too slow.
""Hundreds of patients, families and staff are awaiting answers on suspected hospital outbreaks and Scottish Labour continues to push for speed and transparency, especially for those who are mourning loved ones.""
Jeane Freeman, the health secretary, said: ""This is the most detailed picture of hospital associated infections anywhere in the UK - no other UK nation has published this breakdown - as it includes every single positive case in hospitals and identifies a likely source.""
About 7.3 per cent of Covid-19 cases had probably or definitely originated in hospital. ""This reflects the lower rates of transmission in the community and the incredible efforts of our NHS staff. This data shows that the rate of Covid-19 transmission in hospitals follows the same rate of the pandemic spread in Scotland,"" Ms Freeman said.
""The infection prevention and control measures already in place are vitally important and we have announced enhanced measures to ensure precautions are in place.
""Healthcare working testing, all patient-facing staff to wear masks, and patient and visitor use of face coverings have all been introduced to reduce the risk of hospital-associated infections.""","COVID CORONAVIRUS (92%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (91%); VIRUSES (91%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); PERSONAL PROTECTIVE EQUIPMENT (89%); UK LABOUR PARTY (79%); COMMUNICABLE DISEASE CONTROL (78%); EPIDEMICS (78%); HEALTH CARE ASSOCIATED INFECTIONS (78%); HEALTH CARE POLICY (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (73%); PREVENTION & WELLNESS (73%)

2020-07-02,"Over 1,000 Scots patients catch Covid-19 in hospital",NEWS; Pg. 15,"A biotechnology company behind a coronavirus test has reported a surge in revenues after it was boosted by strong demand for its products.
Novacyt, an Anglo-French business listed on London's junior Aim market, has found itself at the heart of Britain's response to the disease after its boss, Graham Mullis, made an early call last December to start research on a diagnostic test for Covid-19.
The decision has paid off, with revenues at the group during the first six months of the year jumping to (EURO)72.4 million from only (EURO)7.2 million in the same period a year earlier, Novacyt said yesterday.
Novacyt has become a recent stock market darling because of its status as a leading supplier of Covid-19 tests used in laboratories. It has previously developed tests for zika, ebola and sars. The company has most of its operations in the UK, where it manufactures the Covid-19 tests in Southampton. It provides them to more than 130 countries and has a contract to supply the Department of Health with 288,000 per week for use in the NHS.
Its shares were changing hands for about 13p at the beginning of the year but climbed as high as 491p in April amid investor excitement about its prospects. Last night the shares closed up 2½p, or 0.9 per cent, at 270p.
The group said yesterday that the demand for its coronavirus test remained robust, with sales last month totalling (EURO)25.4 million in what marked the sixth straight month of growth.
""Given the visibility of orders, extended contracts and the launch of new Covid-19 related products, the company anticipates revenue for the second half of the year to be greater than the first half and margins to be at least at a similar level,"" Novacyt said.
The company added that it had ""sufficient manufacturing capacity, raw materials and finished goods to meet the expected demand, having orchestrated a significant scale-up of operations during the half year"".
Coronavirus emerged in China late last year and has since spread around the world. There have now been more than 12.9 million confirmed cases of the disease and almost 570,000 people have died, according to figures compiled by Johns Hopkins University in the US.
Novacyt received a boost in April when it became the second business to have its test for the virus listed by the World Health Organisation for emergency use.
There are worries that a second wave of the disease will emerge later in the year and Mr Mullis, 57, said that the company was positioned to meet testing demand if this materialised.
""Nobody can really predict what's going to happen but like many viruses it could end up being worse in colder temperatures and winter and therefore we need to be prepared for that,"" he added.
The company has expanded in recent months and hired 45 employees in the first half of the year, taking its headcount to about 140 staff.
Asked whether Novacyt had identified any new diseases that could become the next pandemic after Covid-19, Mr Mullis said: ""At this stage I would say the answer is no."" However, he added: ""There are rumblings going on at the moment in a number of areas which we're keeping a very close eye on but I wouldn't comment any more than that at this stage.""
The group is also developing other coronavirus-related products, including a test for Covid-19 that could be used outside central labs such as in care homes.

The phase two trial, called Arcadia, involving 150 patients in 30 hospitals in Britain, began at the weekend after approval was granted by the Medicines and Healthcare product Regulatory Agency. Pre-clinical research has suggested that the glucose kinase activator could aid diabetes sufferers who contract Covid-19.
The trial is expected to last a minimum of three to four months and a further later-stage trial may follow. It involves a compound developed by Astrazeneca, one of Britain's two leading pharmaceuticas companies, which was licensed to St George Street, a medical charity led by academics and former drugs industry executives.
St George Street approached Sir Christopher, 62, to help to raise funds for the project via his Excalibur Medicines vehicle, which has taken responsibility for running the programme.
The British government, Mubadala, the United Arab Emirates' sovereign wealth fund, and Sir Christopher have put in roughly equal funds and the venture also is being supported by highnet-worth individuals.
Diabetics face a significantly higher risk of dying from Covid-19, with one in three of all coronavirus hospital deaths in England being associated with the illness, Sir Christopher said.

The Scotch Whisky Association reported that overseas sales had fallen by 23 per cent to £3.8 billion in 2020. Volumes, measured by number of 70cl bottles sold, were almost 13 per cent lower at about 1.14 billion, with annual exports at their lowest value since the near- £3.5 billion in 2010.
Karen Betts, chief executive, said: ""In effect, the industry lost ten years of growth in 2020 and it's going to take some time to build back to a position of strength.""
Sales were down in 127 of the 179 overseas markets for Scotch as countries went into lockdown to limit the spread of Covid-19.
Scotch exports to the US were £729 million in 2020, compared with more than £1 billion in the previous 12 months.
Producers pointed to a fall in airport sales, plus a 25 per cent US tariff on single malt imports hampering sales in the largest market by value. The tariff was introduced in October 2019 as part of a long-running dispute between the European Union and America over subsidies granted to Airbus and Boeing, the aircraft makers.
Betts believes that more than £500 million in tariffs has been paid since the levy came in and has called on Rishi Sunak, the chancellor, to support the industry with a duty cut in next month's budget.

Public Health England found that officials needed to make more effort to engage with communities via groups and people such as faith leaders, to prepare for the future challenges posed by the pandemic.
Its report is based on submissions from and meetings with 4,000 people, and said ""historic racism and poorer experiences of healthcare or at work"" meant people from black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) communities were less likely to seek care.

Alan Payne QC, Jack Anderson, Saara Idelbi and Hafsah Masood for the home secretary; Simon Cox, Daniel Clarke and Donnchadh Greene for various failed asylum seekers, as interested parties. The defendant did not appear and was not represented. Mr Justice Chamberlain said that the tribunal decision under challenge concerned AM, a 29- year old national of Afghanistan who was a ""failed asylum-seeker"", that was, a person whose asylum claim had been rejected and whose appeal rights were exhausted.
When he made his application, AM said that he was street homeless and therefore ""destitute"". There was nothing stopping him from leaving the UK, with help if necessary, but he had taken no steps to do so. Nor, however, had the home secretary taken any steps to remove him.
AM relied on expert evidence about the risks posed by the Covid-19 pandemic to those who were street homeless or forced to live in overcrowded conditions. It was submitted that members of the public were also at risk of contracting Covid-19 from homeless destitute failed asylum-seekers.
The tribunal decided that, in the light of those risks, the home secretary was legally obliged to continue to provide accommodation for AM until step 4 on the government's Roadmap out of lockdown was reached, when the remaining legal restrictions imposed to tackle the Covid-19 pandemic were to be lifted. At the time of the decision, that was anticipated to be on June 21, 2021, though the date was put back to July 19, 2021.
If the tribunal's reasoning was correct, the health risks associated with the pandemic were such that the home secretary was legally required to provide accommodation and support not only to AM, but also to all destitute failed asylum-seekers, until step 4 on the Roadmap was reached. The home secretary challenged that reasoning.
Looking at the matter in terms of the case law on positive obligations under articles 2, 3 and 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (the rights to life, protection against inhuman treatment and respect for private and family life, respectively) the cases could be analysed as followed: (a) It was for the UK government to decide how best to protect destitute asylum seekers from the various threats to their life and health to which homelessness gave rise (including Covid-19) and a broad margin of appreciation was to be accorded to it in taking that decision.
(b) The existence of a margin of appreciation at the international level did not necessarily mean that the national courts had to accord the home secretary an equivalent margin in reaching decisions about policy.
(c) In the present case, however, formulating policy in relation to the accommodation of failed asylum seekers required the weighing of competing policy considerations and the making of predictive judgments about the consequences of particular measures. There were strong constitutional reasons for according the executive a broad discretionary area of judgment when performing those functions.
(d) The Immigration and Asylum (Provision of Accommodation to Failed Asylum-Seekers) Regulations 2005 (SI 2005 No 30) reflected a legislative choice to discharge any positive protective duty by accommodating destitute failed asylum seekers on condition that they took reasonable steps to leave the UK. In general, that was a legitimate policy, at least where the failed asylum seeker was in a position freely to return home.
It fell well within the discretionary area of judgment to be accorded to the home secretary.
(e) In the absence of any explanation as to why AM was not in a position to return home, the home secretary had been entitled to regard the making of an offer of accommodation conditional on taking steps to leave the UK as being a reasonable discharge of any positive obligation under articles 2, 3 or 8 of the Convention to protect AM from risks to his life and health.
His Lordship was prepared to accept that the risks to destitute failed asylum-seekers of contracting Covid-19 if they were forced on to the streets or into ""congregate"" settings were considerably higher than those for the population at large. However, the home secretary had offered AM a way to avoid those risks by registering with the voluntary returns service. If he had done that, he would have been accommodated.
Because he chose not to do so, and did not explain why, his exposure to the risk of contracting Covid-19 had to be assumed to be the result of his own decision, not the home secretary's omission.
In those circumstances, the rights of AM under articles 2, 3 or 8 did not require that he be accommodated, whether until step 4 of the Roadmap had been reached or at all.
The second part of the tribunal's reasoning was based on the rights of the public at large to be protected from risk from infection by homeless failed asylum-seekers.
Assuming, without deciding, that articles 2, 3 and/or 8 of the Convention individually or cumulatively imposed on contracting states a general obligation, owed to the public at large, to take reasonable steps to protect their populations from the risks associated with the Covid-19 pandemic, the range of responses from different contracting states showed that different circumstances and political systems had led to different choices about how the obligation should be discharged.
Any government facing the present pandemic would have many policy choices to make. Some involved matters of high principle, such as to what extent it ought to favour measures that preserved lives in the short term over measures that protected the economy in the short term. Some, like deciding upon the policy for destitute failed asylum seekers, were more specific.
But even those required the decision-maker to decide what weight to give to public interests, such as the integrity of the asylum system. They also required predictive judgments about the impact of particular measures.
It was appropriate to accord to the executive a broad discretionary area of judgment when performing those functions.
Indeed, when the rights in question were those of the public at large, rather than those of an individual or small group, the constitutional reasons for according weight and latitude to the executive and legislative branches were all the more powerful.
There was nothing in the evidence to suggest that failing to accommodate AM and others in his position would increase overall the risk to the health of the public.
More generally, the UK's response to the Covid-19 pandemic had included a suite of other measures designed to protect public health, including unprecedented restrictions on individual freedom.
There was no basis in authority for concluding, against the background of that suite of measures, that the policy of refusing accommodation to destitute failed asylum-seekers who were not taking reasonable steps to leave the UK fell outside the broad discretionary area of judgment accorded to the home secretary under articles 2, 3 and 8 of the Convention.
It followed that the rights of AM under articles 2, 3 or 8, whether taken alone or together with those of the general public, had not required that he be accommodated, whether until step 4 of the Roadmap had been reached or at all.
Furthermore, assuming, without deciding, that AM's status as a failed asylum-seeker was an ""other status"" for the purposes of a discrimination claim under article 14 of the Convention, and that any discrimination against him on the ground of that status would fall within the ambit of article 8, article 14 did not avail AM because: (i) The position of destitute failed asylum seekers was not relevantly analogous to that of the remainder of the general public as, their asylum claims having been rejected and their appeal rights exhausted, they had no legal entitlement to remain. That made it appropriate to make any offer of accommodation to them conditional on their taking steps to leave the UK whereas the same was not true of other members of the general public; (ii) If it were appropriate to compare the treatment of destitute asylum seekers to the treatment of other members of the public, there was an objective justification for treating them differently, namely that the former had no legal entitlement to remain.

2020-12-30,Fighting Covid-19 and so much more Letters to the Editor,NEWS; Pg. 30,"Jim Goodwin has raised concerns about ""frustrating"" Covid-19 testing procedures in Scottish football and said that they should be scrapped ahead of the new season. The St Mirren manager fears a similar type of disruption to the fixture list that dogged the campaign last term.
Ross County have already forfeited their opening Premier Sports Cup tie against Forfar following a Covid outbreak at the Dingwall club while a number of pre-season friendlies featuring cinch Premiership clubs have been cancelled due to coronavirus-related issues.
St Mirren were not short of their own problems last season and were forced to appeal the two 3-0 defeats they were handed for breaching coronavirus regulations and failing to fulfil fixtures against Hamilton and Motherwell.
Goodwin said that there had been a lack of conversation regarding a change in rules going into the new season.
""There's not been any real dialogue regarding what happens next to be honest with you,"" he said. ""We got the protocols sent through from the JRG [Joint Response Group] and the SFA saying pretty much the rules and regulations will stay the same for now.
""That's the template that we're working off of and until told otherwise, that's what we have to do. I'm desperate to do away with this testing. I really am. I think it's a huge frustration for every club out there and obviously a very big expense as well.
""That will hopefully happen around that time you're talking about [August 9, when it is hoped that stadiums can return to maximum capacity]. It's very frustrating when you're sitting watching the European Championships and you're seeing over 60,000 people crammed into Wembley and we're only allowed 500 at our game here next Tuesday [against Dunfermline in the League Cup].
""Listen, there's a time for precaution and I do think we need to come out of it in a steady manner, but I hope there's no setbacks along the way. We've had a long 18 months of being locked up and being told what to do and where to go and when to do it. I think now, the public are desperate to get back to some normality.""
The most significant change for clubs this summer has been the shift from PCR tests to the less reliable, but cheaper, lateral flows.
""I think that for as long as we're testing the numbers are going to continue to show up,"" Goodwin said. ""We test three times a week with the lateral flows and there are some inaccuracies involved with the lateral flows. There's a 75 per cent success rate with that so there's always going to be false positives.
""The problem with that, if you get it on the morning of the game, then you can't get the results of a PCR test back in time for kick-off. If you get a false positive on a Tuesday, you can advise the player to isolate, go and get a test, and hopefully get the result of a PCR back with positive news. That's the predicament that every club in the league is going to find themselves in. It might even be a little bit more difficult to control things this year. At least last year, the players and staff weren't able to go to pubs and restaurants and there wasn't any real socialising.
""This year, everything is pretty much back up and running, albeit with restrictions in place. We can only ask the lads to be sensible, to make sure they're managing the hygiene side of things and wearing masks and trying not to find themselves in too many over-populated areas. Hopefully that gives us a good chance of keeping the virus away from our club.""
With the number of Covid-19 cases continuing to rise as restrictions are loosened, Goodwin is concerned that more games will be postponed.
""Similar to what we went through last year, you can only control when the players are here and we put a huge amount of trust and responsibility into them when they're away from the club,"" he said. ""At the moment, everything is going very smoothly, but that can all change very, very quickly as we know because it's very difficult to control what's happening out there at the moment.
""The numbers are, unfortunately, heading in the wrong direction but we can only do the best we can. You feel for the teams who are having these issues. You speak about Ross County and, first and foremost, we all hope that everybody is okay and nobody is too badly affected.
""But I know what Malky Mackay [the Ross County manager] will be going through because we've been there ourselves and when you get that little bit of unsettlement, if you like, it can affect your preparations and your plans. Hopefully those boys will be back as soon as possible.""
COUNTY FORFEIT CUP TIE
Ross County's League Cup clash away to Forfar tomorrow is off with the SPFL awarding a 3-0 win to the Station Park side (Alasdair Fraser writes). County could not fulfil the fixture after a Covid-19 outbreak ruled out half the squad. At least eight players and staff are understood to have tested positive earlier this week, with others isolating. An SPFL spokesman said: ""Any team unable or unwilling to field a team in a Premier Sports Cup Round 1 group stage tie will forfeit the match on the basis of a 3-0 defeat.

2020-09-01,Glaxo starts key Covid-19 antibody trial,NEWS; Pg. 33,"Sir, Your leading article ""Year of the Nurse"" (Dec 29) provides an excellent overview of the vital work performed by nurses during the pandemic and the great personal costs involved. We all owe them a great debt and must see them properly supported and rewarded in future. We would like to add one point: nurses are increasingly taking on wider roles as first responders in emergencies, nurse practitioners and specialists. Many services for people with long-term conditions such as diabetes, asthma, dementia and other respiratory diseases are now led by nurses and they have a growing role in primary and community care. These developments are absolutely essential if we are to make major improvements in health globally.
Lord Crisp, former NHS chief executive; Professor Sheila Tlou, former minister of health, Botswana; co-chairmen of Nursing Now.
Sir, The number of Covid-19 cases and deaths has rightly received huge media coverage throughout the pandemic. What remains under-reported is the impact that restrictions are having on young people's mental health. In contrast to reports on Covid-19 cases, reports on mental health often don't give mental illness rates or raw figures but talk of trends and percentage differences. Journalists should be investigating the number of children and young people attending primary and secondary healthcare services. In addition, they should report on young people in the community who may not have used healthcare services but are still struggling. This will convey the human cost of social restrictions and give a full picture of the risks and benefits of restrictive measures. Anna Nicholls, fourth year medical student, Hemel Hempstead, Herts Sir, The vaccine is our most important weapon against the coronavirus. GPs

are at their most stretched this winter, as cases rise daily. With this in mind, why is the military not supporting GPs in providing the vaccine?
The vaccine programme will deplete the primary care workforce, taking staff away from routine care and services and from supporting Covid-19 cases in the community. As a profession placed in the heart of communities, we are well placed to be involved in providing the vaccine, but to be entirely responsible for it seems to be putting service provision in primary care at great risk, which in turn will affect the hospital sector. Dr Lucy Andrews London SW15 Sir, I'm at a loss regarding the hysteria about a Covid-overstretched NHS. Yes, intensive care units are filling up again but come Friday, January 1, won't the NHS be receiving an additional £350million extra funding per week?

It is building on work by Scottish Water and academic partners from the University of Edinburgh's Roslin Institute to monitor the fragments of Covid-19 ribonucleic acid (RNA) in waste water. Experts hope the data could help understand trends in the prevalence and distribution of the virus in Scotland, in combination with community testing and hospital admissions data.

The surfaces of many animal viruses and human cells are coated in glycans. Neumifit works to mask glycan receptors in the airways of a patient and thus prevent the virus entering the lungs. Douglas Thomson, Pneumagen's chief executive, said yesterday that clinical trials were due to take place in the first half of next year.
The funding round is being led by Thairm Bio, an early stages life sciences investor, with support from the statebacked Scottish Investment Bank. Mark Bamforth, of Thairm, said: ""We are pleased to be able to back the development of Pneumagen's exciting portfolio in respiratory tract infections.""
Kerry Sharp, director of the Scottish Investment Bank, said: ""Scientists globally are working around the clock to halt the spread of Covid-19. It could take several months or even years for a vaccine to be approved, so the development of effective treatments is crucial. ""The positive results of Pneumagen's early studies are an encouraging step forward. With our continued support, we hope the company can develop a drug that will help to protect people from the current pandemic and any future outbreaks.""

2020-05-28,Pneumagen wins funding for Covid-19 antiviral drug trial,NEWS; Pg. 31,"Conservatively managed funds that place an emphasis on the sustainability of their dividends have been among the biggest winners during the Covid-19 pandemic, a study has found.
Liontrust Income was the top performer in a half-yearly ranking of 59 equity income funds produced by Sanlam, a financial services group. The fund returned 24 per cent in the five years to June 30. Top holdings include US tech stocks such as Apple and Microsoft. The losers were funds aiming to achieve enhanced income, which were most sensitive to dividend cuts, and funds concentrating on small-cap companies, which have a strong bias towards the UK economy, with its dependence on the consumer and services sectors that have been especially badly affected by lockdown.
Behind the top fund in Sanlam's list, which has been running for three decades, was Santander Enhanced Income, followed by Miton UK Multi-Cap Income. They were judged most consistent at delivering on Sanlam's criteria of steady capital growth over five years, solid income distribution and a minimum of volatility.
Among the new arrivals to the list were BlackRock UK Income and River & Mercantile UK Equity Income, which suffered smaller falls than most of their rivals over the turmoil of the past 12 months. Fidelity's MoneyBuilder Dividend fund weathered the recent storm well to rise up the rankings.
At the other end of the spectrum Sanlam again produced its list of consistently underperforming funds that demonstrated the poorest combination of capital growth and income along with greater volatility. Aberdeen Standard UK Income Unconstrained, Janus Henderson UK Equity Income & Growth and Downing Monthly Income were among the worst performers.
They were joined by JO Hambro UK Equity Income, which is more accustomed to being in Sanlam's top ranking; its fall from grace was partly the result of its large holdings in the big bank stocks, which have been instructed not to pay dividends for 12 months. Slater Income, another former high-flyer, has fallen to earth, in part because of its bias towards small and mid-cap stocks.
Sanlam said: ""While dividend streams are now being challenged, the crisis may provide an opportunity for skilled active fund managers who are prepared to search beyond the usual sources of income.""

The figures come from an analysis by the Office for National Statistics, which compared death certificates from March 2 to May 15 with data from the 2011 census.
They found that 30.3 per cent of coronavirus deaths were among people who said their daily activities were ""limited a lot"" because of a health problem or disability, and 28.9 per cent among those whose activities were ""limited a little"".
There were 22,447 deaths across the two categories, both considered disabled. There is likely to be overlap between people who report health problems limiting their daily activities and people with pre-existing conditions known to raise their risk from the coronavirus, such as diabetes.
Marie Tidball, co-ordinator of the Oxford University Disability Law and Policy Project, told The Times there should be an inquiry into the deaths. She added: ""This is a moment which requires urgent answers and for the government to take action to show it values disabled people and our place in society.

2020-07-01,Two in three victims of Covid-19 had a disability,NEWS; Pg. 13,"Boeing is to stop making its 747 jumbo jets after the Covid-19 pandemic and the grounding of the 737 Max pushed it deep into the red.
The aircraft manufacturer yesterday revealed measures to shore up its finances, including cuts to production of its wide and narrow-bodied aircraft, a delay to deliveries of the 777X - its newest jet - by a year to 2022 and confirmation of the demise of the 747.
Boeing reported a net loss of $2.4 billion for the second quarter of this year after revenues fell by 25 per cent to $11.8 billion. It delivered only 20 aircraft during the period, down from 90 in the same quarter last year.
Dave Calhoun, chief executive, said that it could take three years for the aviation industry to recover from the pandemic.
The last 747 will roll roll out of Boeing's factory near Seattle in about two years' time. Nicknamed the Queen of the Skies, the jet celebrated its 50th anniversary last year, but it has fallen out of favour with passengers and airlines, which are turning to more modern, fuel-efficient aircraft. British Airways said this month that it was retiring its 747s, which account for about 10 per cent of its fleet.
The last order for a passenger version of the 747 came in 2017, when the US government asked Boeing to repurpose two 747-8 aircraft for the president's Air Force One transport. After customisation and the installation of classified systems, the aircraft are due to be delivered by December 2024.
Boeing dominates the market for passenger jets along with Airbus, its European rival. The company was already under pressure before the pandemic led to the grounding of aircraft around the world: two fatal crashes involving its 737 Max had led to the passenger jet being taken out of service and orders being put on hold.
The company said yesterday that it would put a brake on plans to increase production of the 737 Max again. It has delayed its timeline to achieve build rates of 31 narrow-bodied aircraft a month to early 2022 from 2021.
The production cuts reflect concern among aviation companies about the pace of the coronavirus recovery.
Global airlines warned on Tuesday that it would take a year longer than expected for air traffic to return to normal levels, with long-range travel hit harder than short-haul routes. The coronavirus outbreak has crippled passenger travel and pushed airlines to the brink of bankruptcy, resulting in many carriers deferring aircraft deliveries.
Mr Calhoun, 63, said that Boeing was working closely with airlines and suppliers to manage a Covid-19 recovery process that could take three years. ""Air travel has always proven to be resilient and so has Boeing,"" he said.
The 737 Max grounding cost Boeing $20 billion. Executives were ousted, production was halted and the supply chain hobbled. Lawsuits and criminal and congressional investigations into the issue are continuing.
? General Electric said yesterday that it planned to sell its stake in Baker Hughes, the oil services business, after falling to a $2.2 billion loss for the second quarter. The company paid $7.4 billion for a controlling stake in Baker Hughes in 2016 and will sell off its holding in the next three years to raise cash.

The institute has been recruiting patients for clinical trials, it was revealed by Catherine Calderwood, Scotland's chief medical officer.
Last month Roslin announced it was taking part in global efforts to better understand and develop therapies for the ongoing coronavirus infection.
Ken Baillie, the senior clinical research fellow in anaesthesia and critical care at the Centre for Inflammation Research and the Roslin Institute, is collaborating with experts around the world to tackle the pandemic. He is a member of two World Health Organisation panels on coronavirus, and attended a recent research meeting in Geneva to discuss the issue.
Researchers have been analysing shared, publicly-available genetic information about the virus. Scientists there are also investigating similarities between the latest virus and Sars-Cov, which is better-known medically and was first identified in the early 2000s, as well as related bat viruses.
The insights could help devise strategies to control Covid-19 and better understand how it spreads.
Dr Calderwood said: ""There is a group in Scotland led by Ken Baillie from the Roslin Institute which is already recruiting patients on a UKwide basis into trials of vaccines."" Researchers at the Roslin Institute said last month they were working to trace when and how the current coronavirus was first transmitted from an animal to a person. By knowing this, they can explore what factors made it possible for the virus to spread.
Based on the current data, scientists believe the virus may have emerged last November or December, which is consistent with the known early cases, although they add that there is a degree of uncertainty.
The most similar coronavirus to Covid-19 is found in bats. However, there are sufficient differences between the two viruses to suggest that the current outbreak did not derive directly from the animals.","VIRUSES (94%); CORONAVIRUSES (93%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); EXPERIMENTATION & RESEARCH (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); PUBLIC HEALTH (90%); VACCINES (90%); SCIENCE & TECHNOLOGY (89%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (79%); MEDICAL RESEARCH (79%); RESEARCH INSTITUTES (79%); EPIDEMICS (78%); INTERNATIONAL GOVERNMENTAL ORGANIZATIONS (78%); INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS & BODIES (78%); PANDEMICS (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (78%); SARS (78%); HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS (77%); ASSOCIATIONS & ORGANIZATIONS (74%); TALKS & MEETINGS (74%); HEALTH DEPARTMENTS (73%); DATA SCIENCE (68%)

The club initially called for the campaign to be voided before criticising the testing regime in a second letter sent to the Football League and rival clubs. Hull are one place and two points above the relegation zone and, along with Huddersfield Town, have expressed concerns about health and safety.
However, plans to resume the season next month received a boost as there were no other positive tests among the 1,014 Championship players and staff examined at the end of last week. Most clubs will train today and the Football League board will meet on Wednesday to try to decide when the season will resume, potentially on June 20.
Hull said both of those who tested positive were asymptomatic but declined to say whether they were players. In their letter to the League, the club claimed to be concerned that one option available was to self-administer the test, involving taking samples from the back of the nose and throat. Eight clubs are understood to be using this slightly cheaper method while the other 16 rely on testers visiting their training grounds.
Each club must foot their own bill of about £210,000 to cover the testing.

However, plans to resume the season next month received a boost as there were no other positive tests among the 1,014 Championship players and staff examined at the end of last week.

Hull said both of those who tested positive were asymptomatic but declined to say whether they were players. In their letter to the League, the club claimed to be concerned that one option available was to self-administer the test, involving taking samples from the back of the nose and throat. Eight clubs are understood to be using this slightly cheaper method while the other 16 rely on testers visiting their training grounds.
Each club must foot their own bill of about £210,000 to cover the testing.

However, Stockholm provides a rather thin sample to judge a whole country by. The fact is that the handling of the Covid-19 pandemic in Sweden is not being driven by design but by default.
Sweden has not been at war for more than 200 years. Other countries that have been through the horrors of war have numerous structural tools to fall back on when the unforeseen happens. When the pandemic struck Sweden the drawbridge was unmanned, and the country was quickly occupied by the virus. The weakest succumbed first: the elderly and newly arrived immigrants. The First Tegnell Doctrine prescribed: sit back and await herd immunity, and stop all test and tracing. Even an advanced app was scrapped. These measures were the perfect rocket fuel for the virus, and it took off.
More draconic measures were needed. The combination of a minority government and the lack of regulatory means produced the Second Tegnell Doctrine: a voluntary lockdown that shut down the country and devastated GDP and employment. Then came the summer and things did stabilise. It was time for the Third Tegnell Doctrine: partial lockdowns and the reintroduction of test and tracing.
Now we are told is it not over by a long shot, but facemasks are still not being promoted. If there is a second wave we will have a Fourth Tegnell Doctrine. In anticipation, some of us are starting to wear facemasks. Bo Ahnebrink Malmo, Sweden Sir, Clare Foges congratulates Sweden on its response to Covid-19 but does not mention arguably the key difference between our two countries: the scale of the state. Libertarians are very supportive of the freedom Swedes enjoy but omit to mention the cost: Sweden's much higher tax take. Julian Osborne London SW17 Sir, Clare Foges claims that the UK's mortality rate from Covid-19 compares poorly with Sweden's, but according to the latest data (from www.Statista.com) the UK rate is only 9 per cent higher at 627 deaths per million compared with 575 deaths per million in Sweden.
Tony Patterson Frimley, Surrey Sir, Matthew Parris (""Good judgment is stifled by the big state"", Sep 26) suggests that levels of community conscience and responsibility in the UK are lower than those in Sweden because of increasingly oppressive state control. He may be right. However, there might be a more significant reason. Levels of income inequality in Sweden are far lower than those in the UK, and social welfare in Sweden is famously generous. If there seems less respect for social responsibility in the UK it might be because of the widespread perception that British society is far from egalitarian: the feeling is that the rich are ""shafting"" society, so why should we comply with their rules? Dr Peter Jagodzinski Plympton St Maurice, Devon Sir, In his excellent article Matthew Parris left out one crucial word in his penultimate sentence. As well as ""distrusting us, barking at us and even blaming us"", our government risks driving us to mutiny by patronising us with silly slogans.

2020-09-29,The Swedish approach to tackling Covid-19 Letters to the Editor,NEWS; Pg. 28,"Scotland's 42 clubs had until late last night to vote on a plan that would grant the SPFL board emergency powers to deal with a second Covid-19 outbreak (Paul Forsyth writes).
A midnight deadline was set for SPFL members to respond to a proposal that would entitle the board to deal as it sees fit with another wave of the pandemic. Neil Doncaster, the chief executive, wants to avoid a repeat of the debacle when a controversial season-ending vote became the subject of legal action.
A 75 per cent majority was required to pass the proposal, which came as several changes to the SPFL board were voted through at yesterday's annual general meeting. Peter Lawwell, the Celtic chief executive, and the St Johnstone chairman, Steve Brown, have stepped up for season 2020-21, as Rangers' Stewart Robertson and Alan Burrows, of Motherwell, stand down. Lawwell and Brown join Les Gray, of Hamilton Academical, as the Premiership voices on the board. Ross McArthur, of Dunfermline Athletic, and Alloa Athletic's Ewen Cameron now represent the Championship. Brechin City's Ken Ferguson continues on behalf of Leagues One and Two, although he will be joined by Gordon Thomson, of Clyde, as an alternate director for the bottom two divisions. The board will be completed by Doncaster, chairman Murdoch MacLennan, and non-executive director Karyn McCluskey. ""Our game is facing a series of challenges unlike anything it has ever experienced, and everyone involved in Scottish football is working tirelessly to restart matches soon,"" said MacLennan. ""The SPFL directors have a key role to play in navigating those challenges.""
The SPFL also announced a schedule for the Betfred Cup. Confirming all 42 clubs would take part, it said a fivematch group stage would run from Tuesday, October 6 to Saturday, November 14. The second round is set for November 28-29, the quarter-finals for December 15-16-17 and the semi-finals for January 23-24. The final will be at Hampden on Sunday, February 28.","COVID CORONAVIRUS (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); SCOTTISH FOOTBALL (90%); SPORTS & RECREATION EVENTS (79%); PANDEMICS (78%); EXECUTIVES (76%); TALKS & MEETINGS (73%); SUITS & CLAIMS (71%); SOCCER (67%)

2020-07-21,SPFL awaits outcome of Covid-19 vote,SPORT; Pg. 71,"Vaccines are effective and safe. They work by training the immune system to attack and destroy a virus if it enters the body. The development in 2020 of several vaccines within a year of the identification of a novel coronavirus was a triumph of modern science. But the evidence is that immunity wanes over time. The government hence announced last month that categories of people most vulnerable to Covid-19 would be eligible for an additional shot of the vaccine a minimum of six months after their second jab. This was the right decision, yet the uptake of these booster jabs has been perplexingly low.
A month has elapsed since the programme began, and NHS figures suggest that only around half of eligible people in Britain aged 80 or over have taken advantage of it. Of some 2.2 million over-80s who have been double-jabbed, less than 1.2 million have had a booster shot. This is not enough to avoid a squeeze on hospitals' capacity during the winter. The government must stress that the pandemic is far from over and that it is a civic responsibility, as well as a matter of self-interest, for eligible people to get additional protection.
The evidence is preliminary but firm. The coronavirus vaccines that have been tested and are in use provide at least six months of protection. Immunological studies have shown a decline in levels of antibodies among people who have been vaccinated against Covid-19 beyond this stage, however. And this is without taking account of new variants of the disease. Hence the decision to provide everyone over 50, or with a health condition that puts them at a higher risk, with a booster shot.
This is only prudent. The programme for booster doses does not mean Covid-19 vaccines are useless, let alone harmful. It is merely an additional measure of protection for those at greatest risk. And these include, most prominently, the elderly.
Why the uptake of booster shots has not been greater among those aged over 80 is not clear. There is no suggestion that older people are being swayed by the anti-vaccine disinformation promulgated by conspiracy theorists. On the contrary, the evidence is that it is younger people, as greater users of social media, who are more susceptible to such dangerous myths as that the pandemic is a hoax and that vaccines are a health risk.
Most vaccinations for known diseases are administered in childhood. It may be that older people feel that two doses of a Covid vaccine, possibly with an annual flu jab in addition, are enough. The government needs to take the initiative in combating complacency. It took a calculated risk in easing restrictions such as the mandating of masks in shops and other public places, hoping that the success of the national vaccination programme would provide adequate protection. But public health policy has to adapt to evidence rather than ignore it. Israel was a pioneer in vaccinating its population against Covid but began offering booster doses to people over 60 from the summer in response to a surge in cases.
More populous countries, notably the US, France and Germany, have also followed a policy of giving booster shots. These protect the vulnerable and prevent transmission, and are especially urgent as winter approaches. The government is rightly planning a relaunch of its communications strategy on the issue this week. Boris Johnson should deploy his communicative gifts to help Britain withstand further incursions from Covid.","VACCINES (98%); COVID CORONAVIRUS (91%); CORONAVIRUSES (90%); COVID-19 CORONAVIRUS (90%); DISEASE IMMUNITY (90%); INFECTIOUS DISEASE (90%); VIRUSES (90%); DISEASES & DISORDERS (89%); EPIDEMICS (89%); PANDEMICS (89%); PUBLIC HEALTH (89%); SENIOR CITIZENS (89%); VACCINATION & IMMUNIZATION (89%); VULNERABLE ADULTS (89%); VULNERABLE HEALTH POPULATIONS (89%); MEDICINE & HEALTH (87%); ANTI-VACCINE MOVEMENT (79%); HEALTH MISINFORMATION (79%); INFLUENZA (79%); PUBLIC POLICY (79%); CONSPIRACY (78%); IMMUNOLOGY (78%); PUBLIC HEALTH ADMINISTRATION (77%); CONSPIRACY THEORY (74%); HEALTH CARE POLICY (74%)
